"HUMANITY IS UNDER NO COMPULSION TO ABDICATE"
JAIME TORRES BODET,
TO THE 5TH SESSION
OF THE UNESCO GENERAL
CONFERENCE
THERE are not many places in the world where one realizes
so clearly as on the banks of the Arno that wisdom and
beauty are the twin ar hes of that invisibl  bridge which
leads from the individual conscience-ever rebellious
against its destiny-to man's collective conscience, ever in
search of general progress. This city's greatest citizen was
an exile. His DIVINE COMEDY confirms it for us : for free
men the longing for the lost fatherland is but the aspiration
to another fatherland that may always be won-humanity
itsell..
Every statue, every picture, that we stop and wonder at
here, every Florentine stone we look at, would give us the lie
were we so arrogant as to conceive our mission as a substitute
for the original creative mission of educators, artists, poets,
and scholars. Happily, we think no such thing. Our
Organization does not so mistake its role. We know that to
seek to impose uniformity on the infinitely diverse and
spontaneous life of culture would be illusory. If Unesco should
attempt to sap the originality and individuality of the different
national cultures, it would be unfaithful to its very origin, born
as our Organization was of a free covenant in which the
representatives of the Governments strove to speak on behalf
of the peoples. The reason for our existence is not to create
what none can create by order, by rules and laws. The clear
intent is rather to serve the creative minds among mankind
by putting them in more direct relation with the problems
of the masses, and at the same time to serve those masses, who,
in the longing 9f their unsatisfied needs, aspire towards
education, and through it towards freedom...
Thus, in clearly recognizing our limitations, we become the
better aware of our ambitions. There is no Unesco science,
no Unesco art, no Unesco philosophy. But there are many
dark places among men ; to light up these places requires a
joint effort on the part of all the different countries : a faith
which no individual State can furnish, a truth of which no
State is the sole repository, a wisdom and knowledge which no
one single State possesses.
OUR greatness will lie in serving. But how ? What can
fifty-sis assembled countries do to strengthen peace by
means of ducation, sc enc  and culture ? What more 
they do-some will ask than they were doing before they
joined Unesco ?
I could not accept such a sceptical attitude. Fifty-six
countries working together in the pursuit of so lofty an ideal
can together do infinitely more than each in isolation, within
its own boundaries and by its own unaided means.
First of all, countries working together in this manner can
regularly exchange information, and can agree simultaneously
to take the most effective measures to surmount or remove
obstacles to the free flow of culture.
Again, they can study and try out together the various
modern means of helping men to participate actively in the
progress of the international community. They can undertake
together to further all steps which may help educators to form
citizens conscious af their rights and yet equally conscious of
their duties towards their fellow-men of every nation, language,
race and religion.
Above all, they can infuse a spirit of justice and concord
in their domestic and foreign policies, so that there may prevail
between peoples and governments that atmosphere of mutual. confidence which is essential for peace. Such an atmosphere
is indispensable for the success of Unesco's mission also. Only
in a world free from the continual threat of war can culture,
science and education bear their finest fruits.
FEAR can corrupt the very aim and essence of education
and of research. It can distort them entirely to meet the
remand. ; of another war. It can tran form these factors
of peace into instruments of hate and destruction. It is
thus of the most fundamental importance that governments
should do everything that lies within their powers, to fight
against the obsession of war, to act as members of Unesco not
only when they speak at Une. sco, but also and still more when,
outside the Organization, they are taking decisions with regard
to all those questions which may affect our aims and ideals.
These are some of the things which fifty-six countries cannot
undertake separately but which, working together, they could
achieve.
This would be a great achievement. Yet it would not be
enough. If for instance education does not provide equality
of prospects to all men and women-the same men and women
who, on the political plane, guarantee collective security with
their lives-then collective security will rest upon bases
which are fundamentally unjust, and therefore unstable and
precarious. So that all countries may provide this equality,
there exists a sacred duty of reciprocal help, on some aspects
of which Unesco has already made a beginning.
According to our Charter, we are an Institution whose
guiding purpose it is to ensure peace by means of international
understanding, and to help to promote that international
understanding by means of education, science and culture.
These are our ultimate aims. Nothing that we undertake must
deflect us from them. None the less, if we would not
have Unesco founder in empty phrases, we must admit that
peace will not be won by us alone.

### A Hundred groups with a common aim
UNESCO COURtER-Page 2
A HUNDRED GROUPS
WITH A COMMON AIM
This is the second in a series of special articles describ-
ing the work of some of the 100 international non-
governmental organizations whose co-operation with
Unesco helps the accomplishment of its programme.
"E ENY-MEENY-MINY-MO..."most of us chanted these words
numberles times when we were children. Are they, as
we may think them now, n thing but a m aningless
children's litany ? Or do they remain, not simply from
our childhood, but from the very childhood of man ?
One theory holds them to be survival of a Neolithic numerical
system used over 10, 000 years ago, but, whatever the origin, their
equivalents are to be found the world over, in civilizations which
have no common language heritage.
It is such curious heritages as these which link us together
beyond national boundaries and the passage of time and which,
with songs, customs, dances and dress, make up the world's
folk-lore.
As a formal study folk-lore is barely 100 years old, but in that
time it has become so widely developed that the International
Commission on Folk-Arts and Folk-Lore-the international body
formed in 1928 to co-ordinate the activities of folk-lore groups--
to-day has nearly 1, 000 members in more than 50 countries.
This year, the International
Commission, now working with
Unesco under a system of consult-
ative arrangements, will produce,
with Unesco's help, the first
volume of a publication on folk-
lore. Each issue of this publica-
tion,"Laos", will deal with diffe-
rent aspects of folk-lore. In one
there will be a series of studies
on masks and their development
and use in different civilizations.
Another, for example, will consist
of comparative studies on gestures,
and another on lullabies.
Of what interest are masks,
gestures and lullabies to Unesco ?
They are such small parts of our
lives that we take them for
granted. And it is for this reason
that they make up the folkways
or systems which have held
societies together throughout their
evolution from pre-history to
modern times.
Eventually they form a record
of what is essential to man in his
collective and individual life.
Through comparative studies,
research workers recognize reli-
gious, political and language differ-
ences, not as fundamental, but as
alternate solutions to the same
basic problem.
"Mo Run Geal Og"
To give scholars access to thet scientific facts established in
the century of folk-lore
research is one of the purposes of
the International Commission on
Folk-Arts and Folk-Lore.
In any field of specialized study
a comprehensive bibliography is
essential and work on such a
bibliography in folk-lore has been
in progress since 1917. Now, with
the aid of Unesco, it is nearing
completion.
Unesco is also encouraging the
preparation of a multilingual
glossary of terms used in folk-lore
and ethnology which, when
completed, will give definitions and
equivalents in thirty languages.
Folk music is a specialized field
in the study of folk-lore itself.
Last year, the International
Commission called-a meeting in
Geneva to discuss a uniform system
for notations in folk music. The
classical European method of
writing music cannot be used, since
it makes no provision for marking
quarter tones, which exist in some
folk music, and cannot deal with
certain other folk variants of
timing and rhythm.
One of the International
Commission's member organiza-
tions, the Folk-Lore Institute of
Scotland, is now at work on a
linguistic survey which includes
musical study. Equipped with
recording machines, its members
are tracing, through songs and
stories, the remnants of the old
Gaelic language still found in
Scotland.
"Mich [arla nam bratach bana...
Mo run geal og..."these are songs
which are the last representatives
of the ancient music of the Hebri-
des, in the archaic pentatonic
scale. It is through the preser-
vation of such heritages that cul-

Tales of fantastic exploits are legion among the folk-loire songs and stories handed down
from one generation to another. The adventures oaf Sinbad the Sailor, Jack the Giant Killer
and Gulliver may all once have had a certain basis of fact, but time and the human ima-
gination have embroidered them to a point that makes us dismiss them as incredible. It
was under the title of"Gulliver Revived"that the adventures of a more recent raconteur of
atories, Baron yon Munchausen, were published in France in 1787. These illustrations are
taken from the first French edition of this collection of the Baron's experiences.
tures live on, even as small groups
in countries which have swallow-
ed them, as the Basques in Spain,
the Bretons in France and the
Flemish Scots.
Eventually the International
Commission on Folk Arts and Folk-
lore hopes that history will be
taught, not as a series of battles
and conquests, but as the daily life
and languages, agricultural and
technical achievements of differ-
ent peoples, their dances and
poetry.
Understanding On All levels
UNESCO is being helped towards
another important goal--
bringing advanced civiliza-
tions and under-developed regions
closer together, to secure for both
the benefits often lost through
misunderstanding and ignorance--
by another organization, the Inter-
national Union for Anthropologic-
al and Ethnological Sciences.
Members of this organization,
now working under consultative
arrangements with Unesco, include
groups studying the native peoples
of America the South Sea Islands
and the primitive cultures of
Africa. One of these, the Inter-
national African Institute, has
been working on a series of special
studies which will help Unesco's
work on inter-cultural studies.
Values and traditions among
African societies often differ sub-
stantially from those of European
civilization. To-day, African peo-
ples who, until a generation ago
lived an entirely un-industrialized
life, are playing an increasingly
important part in world econo-
mics. To eliminate the conflicts
which have arisen in the past,
there must be understanding on
every level of dealing between
Africans and representatives of
western civilization.
To this end, the African Institute
is preparing a volume on African
social and cultural values, and
African reactions to western atti-
tudes and techniques.
Then again, family relationships
play an important part in African
societies, and embrace a long range
of rights and obligations which
are not always understood by
other peoples. Such understanding
is, however, necessary to the
smooth running of the new poli-
tical and economic role which
Africa is entering on in world
affairs.
Avoiding Past Mistakes
UNDER contract with Unesco,the African Institute has
been at work for almost a
year on a study of African kinship,
marriage and family life, to be
published in French and English.
This work will anticipate causes of
friction likely to arise under condi-
tions of economic change.
Extensive fleld studies, to inves-
tigate African social organization,
moral and religious ideas have also
been proposed. The history of
African affairs is largely a record
of trouble resulting from misunder-
standings on the part of outside
civilizations which have dealt with
them. We must not, today, repeat
the mistakes of the past through
ignorance.
The work done by the Inter-
national African Institute has been
so satisfactory that Unesco has
contracted with the International
Union for Anthropological and
Ethnological Sciences, to begin
similar studies among the native
peoples of America and the South
Sea Islands.
Through such practical applica-
tion of research and experience,
the free exchange of educated
opinion among peoples of different
cultures will form common ground
for the foundations of a lasting
peace.

### Adult education in Austria
### Experts to seek best adult education methods at UNESCO sponsored seminar
Pace 3-UNESCO COURIER
EXPERTS TO SEEK BEST ADUlT EDU[ATION METHODS
AT UNESCO SPONSORED SEMINAR
IN a quiet country hotel on the shores of Lake
t Mondsee in the Austrian Alps, education specialists
from me twenty countries will meet this month
for a seminar on adult education organized by Unesco.
From June 18th to July 29th these educationists,
gathered at the Waldhotel, in Kreuzstein, about 25 miles
from Salzburg, will continue part of the work begun last
year at EIsinore, Denmark, by the first International
Conference on Adult Education to be held since the war.
Embracing every kind of study and every form of
technical and cultural knowledge, adult education has
become one of the most important modern problems, and
one of the most universal.
But it has an over-riding purpose-to defend the
cause of peace in men's minds, to"awaken", asM. Torres
Bodet, Unesco's Director-General, told the Elsinorf'
Conference,"in the conscience of every adult
an awareness both of his personal responsi-
bility and of his intellectual and moral fel-
lowship with the whole of mankind".
It was with these words in mind that the
Elsinore Conference laid down two funda-
mental principles for adult education-unity
of aim and free choice of methods,"that
should lead, through education, to a type of
culture in which the motive principle is per-
sonal responsibility".
SINCE 1947, Unesco hasinstituted a new kind of
conference-the Seminar.
The Seminar brings together
educators from a number of
countries to examine important
educational problems. These
educators make plans. of action
applicable to their respective
countries and prepare in-
formation material which can
be used on a national or
an international scale. The
Seminar, as well as being a
real international gathering, is
a means of education in in-
ternational understanding.
Apprenticeship and re-education.
THE most effective ways of achieving thiswill be sought by the speci lists meeting
at Kreuzstein, this month. They know
that in adult education the best results are
not realized through conventional educational
means. Adult education is to some extent
both a complementary and a compensatory
process ; it is partly an apprenticeship and
partly a work of re-education.
AFTER the disaster of
National Socialism and
war, adult education in
Austria has more to do
than merely to spread know-
ledge ; it must demonstrate the
real values in democracy, hu-
man understanding, tolerance
and self-control.
This is not at all easy, as
the younger generation first
got to know these words
amidst misery, starvation and
political chaos. In any case,
it is not enough to approach
the intellects of the students,
but the whole human being
with mind and soul.
But there is another diffi-
culty. Austria is a country of
an old and most valuable cul-
ture. But many people, beset
by daily problems, find no
comfort in it. To many, cul-
ture appears to be a luxury,
useless for the"man in the
street", So adult education
has to build new bridges be-
tween men and culture to
make them meet.
In Austria, adult education
tries to approach the whole
human being. For this reason,
the residential colleges have
arranged courses of four to
twelve weeks'duration, in
which young farmers, farm-
workers, factory-workers and
clerks become a community of
their own. Plays, excursions,
dancing, singing, music, sport
are important parts of this
syst8m of education. The
teacher behaves as a friend,
the lectures are followed by
discussions.
Set ! Activity the Goal
A MORE rationalistic type isthat of the Folk High
School (Volkshoch-
schulcn) and evening classes
in the towns. It is not easy
to get. a holiday for purposes
of adult education ; so many
people, busy all day long in
offices and factories, attend
evening courses and single lec-
tures in these institutions.
From there classes grow nu-
merous discussion groups and
study circles, for self activity
is a conscious goal. As far as
possible, all technical means,
such as cinema, phonographs
and projectors are used, but
these means are most limited.
Of special interest and im-
portance are the attempts
towards artistic education.
Here again, institutions of
adult education try to lead the
students to understand art by
self activity (singing groups,
sculpture workshops, handi-
craft clubs, etc.). Excursions
to museums and exhibitions ;
good reproductions of works
of art in the rooms and corri-
dors contribute also to the
students'interest.
Role of Libraries
IN the provinces, excursionsto si nna or oth r towns,
to theatre concerts, exhi-
bitions are increasing in num-
ber. The Volkshochschule
Linz has initiated visits to
Italy and other neighbouring
countries, a most valuable re-
newal of an old educational
idea.
In the libraries, the leaders
advise the readers from a psy-
chological point of view to
bring the right book together
with the right person as far
as possible. This is made
more difficult by the limited
book supply in many libraries.
The librarians are partic-
ularly encouraged to increase
their usefulness by attending
special courses. Lectures are
given to enable readers to
meet the authors personally
and discussion groups meet
frequently.
In the last few years, many
new circulating libraries have
been founded : small chests for
fifty or hundred books are
sent to remote places and ex-
changed from time to time
Small town libraries have a
similar exchange system.
Educators from about 20 countries will meet in this lakeside hotel at
Kreuzstein. in the Austrian Alps, from June 18th to July 29th. for Unesco's
Seminar on Adult Education.
The problem is not so much how to teach a given subject
or to impart a given technique but rather how to co-
operate in helping men and women to develop a wider
understanding and use of life.
The Kreuzstein Seminar will therefore be more than an
opportunity for the experts to compare methods and
exchange views ; it will offer them a chance to give on-
the-spot demonstrations of adult education methods.
At Kreuzstein, they will study the many adult education
methods used in different countries and their discussions will
be combined with practical demonstrations such as exhibitions
and film shows.
The experts will be divided into four study groups under the
Seminar leader, Dr. Sven Bjorklund, Dean and founder of
the Stockholm University for adult education, and world
famous authority on the subject.
Towards A Community Spirit
THE first group will study the ways in which adult educ-ation is organized an  administered according o local
and national needs. Through the exchange of ideas and
experiences their work should produce a useful guide to both
the organization of adult education programmes and enlisting
of support for them.
The second group will study the"intellectual and scientific
training"of adults through classes, lectures, study-circles, films
and radio. It will also examine questions of specialization in
subjects connected with the stuBent's work and the popula-
rization of science.
"`social and economic training"will be the concern of the
third group, in which the experts will consider the best ways
of developing among adults a community spirit and an inter-
national outlook.
The fourth group will deal with the arts, and with the pro-
blem of leisure-hours.
The four group leaders who have already been appointed,
are : M. Jean Le Veugle (France), Mr. S. Whitman (United
States), Mr. Alex Sim (Canada), and Sig. Joannes Carlo (Italy).
The seminar will consider the possibility of establishing an
international centre for adult education, which would not only.
serve to train educators, but would also bring them into touch
with statesmen, writers and trade-union leaders.
The results of the seminar will subsequently be published as
a brochure for the guidance of educators throughout the
world.
NEW HEAD FOR UNESCO'S
EDUCATION DEPARTMENT
M tic. LIOXE. L ELVIX, formerly Principal of Ruskin College.
Oxford. has taken up his duties as Head of Unesco's
Education Department, in succession to Dr. C. E.
Beeby, now Director of Education in New Zealand.
Mr. Elvin started teaching English Literature at Cambridge
University in 1930, two years after graduating from there
with a tD'st class Honours'Degree. During the war he served
in the British Air Ministry and the Mimstrv of Information
where he was in charge of the Labour and industry Section,
American Division.
In 1945 he resigned his Cambridge Fellowship to become
Principal of Ruskin College. Since then he has been a member
of the University Grants Committee, of the Secondary Schools
Examinations Council and in 1948 was appointed to the Central
Advisorv Council on Education.
He is the author of several works, among
t) iem."Men of America"a collection of
historical and biographical essays on leading
figures in the history of the United States.
andean Introduction to the Study of
Poetry".
In carrying out his new duties, Mr. Elvin
told the"Courier", last month, he hoped
"to ptay a small part in creating the state of

and to lIelp Unesco to become a more active

needs of education and, through education,
to serve the needs of the world community,
particularly for peace. There is no conflict
between these two, though'we have to find
a balance, and one that rrw. y vary Trom time
to time.
"While I regard the first function as es-
sential, we cannot limit ourselves to it", he
said,"because it involves a necessarily slow
process of collecting information and the
l'ike, and the times are too urgent for that
alone. As H. G.. Wells said'/taen contemplat-

DIETARY deficiencies in national or regionalcultures may result from two common causes.
One of these is the loss by a people of their

wisdom of their ancestors. The other is the barrier
ofcuttura) isotation-mutua) ignorance of the wealth
created by unknown men and women, in unknown
places, surrounded by the fence of unknown langua-
ges. On this page are described two current
projects-each aimed at one of the"hidden hungers"
of modern man. Libraries throughout the world
will contribute to the work of the Institute for the
Restoration of Arab Manuscripts, in restoring,
preserving and making available the written records
of Arab culture-for the benefit of Arab lands, and
finally of all lands. The work of the Beirut Com-
mission, translating Islamic works into Western
languages-and Western classics into Arabic-wit)

mankind.
THE debt owed to Islam by Western science and philosophy is often forgottenand, at best, is but vaguely understood-although the Influence uf Moslem

appears everywhere. Without some knowledge of them it would he difficult
to account for the"renaissances"of the)) th,) 3th and 16th centuries. But
when students wish to turn to the ori-

sophrs, they find themselves at a loss.
Many people would like to know

phers of Damascus and historians of

supply them with what they want.
Most of the treatises, memoirs, en-
cyclopaedias and meditations have
never been translated. Some of them
appeared a long time ago in Latin. Of
this immense literature, only a few
isolated fragments, in large libraries
and specialized reviews, are available
. to anyone who does not read Arabic.
This regrettable state of affairs is
now being changed. A Commission,
consisting of three Unesco represen-
tatives and three Lebanese experts,
has been working for a year in Beirut
to provide the world with translations
of the most representative works of
Islam.
The Commission's programme is a
big one. To inaugurate it, two great
names have been chosen-As Ghazali
and Avicenna.
Few translators have devoted them-
selves to the philosopher of Tus,
although Al Ghazali is particu-
larly close to European thought, on
which he exercised a far-reaching in-
fluence. Thanks to the Pugio Fidei of
Raimundo Marti, this influence ways
extended first to St. Thomas Aquinas
and later to Pascal. His life, which
was dominated by a dramatic conver-
sion, had points of comparison with
the author of Les Pensees.
Lawyer and Philosopher
BORN in 1058 A. D., Al Ghazali devot-jt ed his prodigiOus technical ability to
the study of law and philosophy. As
a professor at Baghdad, the elegance
of his scepticism made him famous.
In 1095, at the height of his popularity.
when his teaching consisted of doubt-
ing all religious truths and the possi-
bility of absolute knowledge, he under-
went a profound mystical crisis, which
resulted in a complete mental break-
down. When he recovered, he re-
nounced his position and fortune and
became a dervish. Surrendering him-
self to God, he led a wandering, asce-
tic life devoted to prayer and writ-
ing. He died in 1111.
His best books date from the last
phase of his life : the voluminous
Summa theologian, Ihya Ulum al-Din ;
his compilation of moral exhortations,
A pholograph 01 the Ilrel AYtcenna manuecrlpl published in Latin in Eulopt.
Ayuha I-Walad, on the insufflciency
of knowledge if not accompanied by
charitable work ; and his spiritual au-
tobiography, Al Munqidh Min al-
Dalal, frequently compared with the
Confessions of St. Augustin. In the
near future, the Beirut Commission
will present French translations of the
last two, works.
Avieemna's Last Work
IT might be expected that Avicenna'swork would be better known in the
West. His philosophy is accepted
as being intimately related to Thom-
SCATTERED ARAB MANUSCRIPTS
Collected and Mierofilllled I
THE valuable and difficult task of making ancient Arabic docu-
ments available to Middle Eastern and other cultures has already
been far advanced by the Institute for the Restoration of Arab
Manuscripts. Under auspices of the Institute, created by the Arab
League in 19. 46, more than a million pages of manuscripts have
already been traced and microfilmed in libraries in Damascus, Aleppo,
Cairo and Alexandria.
The pages thus far photo-
graphed represent more than
2. 500 entire manuscripts, of
which there are about a million
in various parts Qf the world,
and of which only a small pro-
portion has been listed. Many
of them are preserved on frag-
ments of papyrus or vellum,
and cover a wide range of sub-
jects. In addition to the reli-
gious writings, including parts
of the Koran, law studies, lite-
rature, music, philosophy, his-
tory, education and science,
there Is a group under the
heading.'Cooking and Perfu-
mes".
World-Wide Research
T IDRAIMES everywhere havebeen ask d by th Insti-
tute for lists of Arab
works in their possession, in
order to catalogue them, and
experts In count. ries all over
the world have been asked to
co-operate in research on docu-
ments which have not been
properly listed. In countries
where it is impossible to find
anyone with sufficient know-
ledge for this task, the Institute
is sending experts out to study
the documents and make a
choice. Libraries with the ne-
cessary apparatus will be asked
to contribute microfilm copies
of the Arab manuscripts of
value in their possession.
Reliable lists already in exis-
tence have been consulted by
the Institute, and a selection
made from them.
For All lands
I x particular the Institute call-ed upon sev ral exp rts to
make selections from man)'
of the works which Brockel-
mann considered outstanding
in his historic treatise on Arab
literature,"Geschichte der Ara-
bischen Literature.

tion of microfllmed manuscripts
will be available not only to
students In the Middle East.

library on request.

future.
ism. Yet, of his 355 works, only his
books on medicine are really widely
known. Up to the 18th Century, these
were standard works in all European
universities.
His philosophical work is represent-
ed in European languages only by
extracts or summaries made at second
hand. There has never been a full
translation of the great book he wrote
at Ispahan in the last years of his
life, in which he departed considerably
from the Aristotelianism that had go-
verned all his previous writings. This
book, Kitab al-isharat wat tanbihat,
represents the final development of
Avicenna's thought and shows ration-
ilistic tendencies that preclude his
mysticism from being regarded as
purely religious.
It is this book-the first unabridged
 verslOn-tnat WlH De PUDllShed by the
Beirut Commission. Translated into
French by MIle Goichon, it will enable
the West to arrive at a more accurate
appreciation of the remarkable con-
tribution of the great Persian writer.
The fourth work which the experts
will probably translate is a book by
Ibn Khaldun, the great 14th century
Tunisian historian. The plan is to
publish his Muqaddama, the preface
to his Universal History, in which Ibn
Khaldun, a predecessor of Montes-
quieu, studied the rise and fall of
empires.
Great Books of the West
qp HESE undertakings do not exhaustthe activities of the Commission.
To make the great works of Islam
known throughout the world, and first
of all in the West, is but one of its
aims. It also intends to ensure a wide
circulation of representative examples
of Western literature translated into
Arabic. Heading the list of works is
Aristotle's Politics, of which Islam has
never had a faithful translation. Next
comes Don Quixote, Descartes'Dis-
course on Method, Shakespeare's A
Winter's Tale. Bacon's Essays, and
La Storia della Colonna Infame, a.
moving work by Manzoni.
Although these activities are con-
centrated in Beirut, their purpose con-
cerns the whole Arab world. As the
entire project develops, it is expected
that all the Arab states, in collabor-
ation with the Cultural Committee of
the Arab League, will be involved. Sy-
ria is already about to take part in
the work of the Commission, and
places have been assigned to repre-
sentatives of Egypt, Iraq and Saudi
Arabia.

Unesco undertook the preparation
of this volume at the request of the
United Nations Sub-Commission on
Freedom of Information and of
the Press. It was prepared in the
Division of Free Flow of Inform-

joins with the U. N. in efforts to
promote the freedom of information.
The Sub-Commission made use of the
book at its annual session, which took
place at Montevideo last month.
For the first time, information on
the world's facilities to see and hear
by means of press, radio, films and
television has been assembled in one
volume. Unesco has just published a
lively, illustrated book entitled :

On-The-Spot Surveys
THE collection of facts and figuresthat went i to the maki g of the
volume was carried out under the
direction of a young Canadian profes-
sor of political science, Albert A. Shea,
who has been studying the question of
communication by press, radio and film
for a number of years. Available to
him were the result of on-the-spot
surveys of press, radio and film faci-
lities, carried out by Unesco's Technic-
al Facilities Division in 43 countries
and being extended to  the entire
world.
The book opens with a series of
coloured maps, charts and pictographs
showing at a glance how the world's
peoples are served by their communic-
ation systems.
The next section highlights the in-
dividual pattern of communication for
every country-number and circul-

news agencies, schools of journalism,
distribution of radio transmitters and
receivers, developments in television,
number of cinemas, film production,
film imports and other basic inform-
ation.
The third section consists of detailed
data, mainly statistical, for the reader
seeking facts and figures on mass
media in any area.
Facilities And Freedom
IN a foreword, Unesco refers to itsefforts to help people increase and
improve their knowledge of one
another through such means as press,
radio, films and television.
"Enjoyment of the right to inform-
ation requires, as a first step, that
technical facilities shall exist for
receiving information". The foreword
adds."It also requires that the
facilities, where they exist, shall be
used freely and fully to inform."
"This report assembles the basic
facts. From the facts, action must
follow. Millions of people, in vast
areas of the world, have little or no
modern means of communication. They
must be helped to obtain them. And,
at the same time, those engaged in
press, radio and films must enjoy the
freedom, and demonstrate the respon-
sibility, which will enable these
potential links between peoples to
serve peace and international under-
standing."
The book is available to the general
public and can be obtained through
Unesco sales agents. It is priced at
$1. 20 or 7s. sterling or 350 French
francs.

### Junior music, a force for world harmony
### Science brings school to crippled children
UNESCO COURII ; R-Page 6
IN October nineteen hundred and forty, M. Marcel Cuvelier, Managing
Director of the Brussels Philharmonic Society, set to work in
German-occupied Brussels to carry out a plan he had been
considering for some time-the organization of a musical movement
for the youth of Belgium.
His original aims had been to interest boys and girls in music, to
form their musical taste and to offer them concerts at prices they could
afford. But now, he had a further aim-to compete for the interest and
devotion of Belgian youth against the Nazis, who had already begun to
set before young Belgians the example of the Jugendbewegen, the Nazi
youth movement.
The initial phases of the plan had
to carried out discreetly, and its
patriotic purpose had to be well
camouflaged as"non-political". Still
anxious to ingratiate themselves with
the Belgian people, the Nazis did not
interfere with the plan in its early
stages. Quickly it grew so popular
that they could not interfere-
without giving up all ; hope of
"winning"the youth of the country.
The mere whispered announcement of
the plan, circulating through the
schools, brought together in one
season more than two thousand young
people to listen to four symphony
concert programmes ranging from
Bach to Stravinsky.
During the second season of the
Jeune5Ses Musicales (Junior Music) as
the movement was called, its member-
ship increased to three thousand-and
the seed sown almost in secret pro-
duced a surprising harvest.
The movement began to spread to
other countries. In 1941, René Nicoly
founded in Paris the"Jeunesses
Musicales de France". Finally, the
Liberation made possible the found-
ation of the International Federation
of Junior Music, created in 1946 at the
Brussels Congress to which six
countries sent delegates or observers.
The distance travelled along the
international road by Junior Music
was marked at the Federation's fifth
congress held recently in Vienna,
attended by delegates from branches
of the movement in eight countries
For Youth-boy Youth
THE reason for this success is not1 only the enthusiasm shown by
the leaders, but the movement's
fundamental principle that
all members take an active
part in the life of the group.
All activities are worked out
for young people by young
people-membership is
limited to those aged bet-
ween 12 and 25 years of age.
Members are not"herded"
to concerts. They are free to
go or stay away as they
please and are able to express
their disapproval or congra-
tulations to the Directorate
on the concerts, music and
other programmes which are
arranged.
Junior Music in Belgium
has formed its own orchestra
and choral society and pu-
blishes a regular magazine.
"Les Cahiers J", which em-
braces the theatre, cinema
and poetry as well as music.
In Brussels, where there are
now more than ten thousand
members, they have formed a
council of delegates.
The members of this coun-
cil-boys and girls elected
in every school-do the
administrative work, encou-
rage in their fellow members
the appreciation and study of
music, and arrange gramo-
phone concerts, singing com-
petitions and reading courses.
This delegate system reinforces the
freely accepted discipline which is
one of the best features of the
movement combined with the team
spirit which continually inspires new
ideas and fresh ventures.
In Junior Music, young people find
that the realms of art are no longer a
closed book for them, restricted to
their elders and, horribile dictu, thrust
down their throats as lessons. They
can get as enthusiastic about a piece
of music as they might about a sport-
ing fixture or an expedition with their
Scout troop.
An Edueational Force
BELGIUM'S Junior Music, recentlycelebrating its tenth birthday,
was abtê to look back on an im-
pressive record of concerts, lectures,
meetings and classes. Although it has
never set itself up as a school or a
league, its educational effects have
been profound.
Its appeal is directed toward arousing
the intelligence and discrimination of
young people and not the awakening
of a short-lived enthusiam among
them. Instead of trying to force
them to accept hard and fast cultural
Among the recent celebrations organized by Belgium s
"'Jeunesses Musicales"to mark the tenth anniversary of
its foundation was an exhibition in Brussels on the
movement's growth and achievements. This photo

founder of the movement. Behind, examining em exhibit

standards, it brings them in contact
with culture that is continually
developing.
One of the deeper implications of
the movement was summed up by its
founder, Marcel Cuvelier, when he
wrote :"We f1 that the extension of
'Jeunesses Musicales'to an increasing
number of countries wit do much to
draw nations closer toeGer and will
make a tangible contribution to the
building of Peace.".
W. 1LECTRONIC science has broughtschool directly from distant class-
rooms to more than 1, 000 American
children kept from normal physical
attendance because of handicaps resulting
from serious illness or disabling ac-
cidents. By means of two-way voice
communication over telephone wires be-
tween electrical devices in school class-
rooms and in rooms of homes or hospitals,
the crippled children have been able to
get the full advantages of regular educ-
ation as well as the psychological bene-
fits of indirect contact with schoolmates.
The system, which is described in The
Crippled Child, official magazine of the
American National Society for Crippled
Children and Adults of Chicago, Illinois,
has been in use for ten years in 10m and
other parts of the middle western region
of the United States. A portable two-
way radio"et in the classroom picks up and transmits every spokt'n
word over a leased telephone wire to the crippled student's bedroom.
There, over a similar radio set, he answers the class roll call, recites his
lessons and maintains voice contact with the teacher and his classmates.
The classroom radio unit is plugged into outlets in the various rooms of
the school, permitting the pupil at home to.'move about".
Stimuiu ! To Recovery
T Hie'''electrical school"has not only successfully brought education toshut-in children, but has helped the chances for recovery, through
psychological stimulus, of many young victims of infantile paralysis,
arthritis, tuberculosis and cardiac ailments.
A number of the crippled pupils have not only kept abreast of their
fellow pupils who attended classes in the ordinary manner but have out-
distanced them in reaching high scholastic achievement. One boy from
Mason City, Iowa, who never saw the insidt : C of his school, was elected
president of his class. Three high school students of different schools
led their classes.
A 16-year old victim of arthritis, who lived on a farm near the town
of Ottumwa. studied for four years at the.'electrical school"after three
and one half miles of special telephone construction had been carried
out to make her"attendance"possible.
Other kinds of schooling problems due,
not to disease, but to distance, are also
being solved by modern methods of com-
munication elsewhere in the world.
In such diverse places as New Zealand.
France, Nigeria and China, radio has
been a vital element in bringing learning
to those who would otherwise be deprived.
New Zealand has combined radio lectures
with recitations by mail for children in
inaccessible places.
In Paris, the Scrbonne providers courses
by radio-an enormous advantage to
. many who cannot attend classes, notably
the mothers of small children.
Both in Nigeria and China, as well as in
other relatively underdeveloped areas,
collective radio listening has brought
vital knowledge-of health, better living
and wider cultural horizions-to children
and grown ups alike.

### Fifth session of UNESCO's General Conference opens in Florence, first speakers urge greater UNESCO contribution to peace efforts
Page 7-UNESCO COURIER
Fifth Session of Unesco's
General Conference Opens, ?

FIRST SPEAKERS URGE
'GREATER UNESCO
: _   : : _,."
:   : CONTRIBUTION TO
PEACE EFFORTS
THIS issue of the Courier went to press during the first days of the GeneralConfer nce, with virtuaIly the whole of the age d' !, remaining to b  de lt
with. Awaiting discussion and action,. for example, was the whole
programme of the Organization for 1951. Beyond this, the delegates were
to consider the entire role of UNESCO in relation to efforts of the United
Nations to preserve world peace, and were to project a long-range, permanent
programme for the Organization. To present fragments of the early dis-
cussions or fragmentary and inconclusive reports on changing situat'. ú'lS,
would be incompatible with the duty of the Courier to give a balanced view
of the Conference and its work. At press time, for example, questions resat.
ing to the proper representation of China, and of the participation in the
Conference of Hungary and Czechoslovakia had not been resolved. In this
issue are included only repoTu and statements made to the delegates, before
their deliberotWn3 began.
A FANFARE of trumpets resoundithrough one of the largest and
most beautiful rooms in the
world-the Hall of the Five
Hundred of the Palazzo Vecchio in
Florence, Italy, heralded the opening
of the fifth session of Uhesco's Gene-
ral Conference on May 22.
As the four trumpeters, dressed in
picturesque 14th century costumes,
blew the fanfare, delegates from 56
countries rose from their seats to
greet the entry of Signor Luigi
Einaudi, President of the Italian
Republic, who had come to Florence
to welcome them.
More than 500 delegates from 56
member states-among them nine
ministers of education-as well as
representatives from other United
Nations Specialized Agencies and
non-governmental organizations
were gathered in Florence for the
opening of the Conference which
was scheduled to continue until
June 18.
The significance of this fifth
Unesco General Conference as an
occasion for re-defining Unesco's
role in the world and examining how
it can contribute more vigorously to
the United Nations mission of peace
was underlined by many of the open-
ing speakers. It was especially
stressed by M. Jaime Torres Bodet,
Unesco's Director-General, when
presenting his report to the Confer-
ence. (M. Torres Bodet's speech is
reported on pages 1 and 10 of this
issue.)
TRUSTEE OF PEACE
COUNT Stefano Jacini (Italy) whowas elected conference resident
in succession to Dr. E. Ronald Wal-
ker (Australia) told the delegates :
"After five years of praiseworthy
efforts, of successes and failures,
both useful and instructive, we have
come to a turning point in Unesco's
history.
"We must now adopt once and for
all a particular line and method", he
said. Describing Unesco as"the
trustee of a world-em bracing-notion
of peace and progress", Count Jacini
urged the desirability of concentrat-
ing Unesco's work on a few chosen
projets.
Sir John Maud, Chairman of
Unesco's Executive Board, presenting
the Director's General's activities
Signor Luigi Einaudi. President of the Ita-
lian Republic, welcoming the delegates at
the auqural session of the Florence
Conference.
Nearly 600 delegates from Unesco's Member
States arrived in Florence to attend the Filth
Session of the General Conference. Some
01 them are shown here listening 10 the
opening speeches in the Hall or the Five
Hundred, at the Palazzo Vecchio.
Speakinq to representatives of Unesco National Commissions who. met before
the openinq of the General Conference, M. Torres Bodet, Unesco's Director
General declared :"The letters which reach me from time to time-sometimes
from very humble people who have heard about Unesco on the wireless or have
seen one or another of our publications-prove to me that there are in our
Member States forces oi enthusiasm, idealism and self-sacrifice which ask no
better than to devote themselves to our cause if we give them the chance."
"But how could the Secretariat in Paris reach the unknown millions who
are our real friends ?"asked M. Torres Bodet. ! t iz here that the National
Commissions have an essential task", he said.'''To the extent to which they
are really representative of all the forces in their own countries, they can give
Unesco a hold, a degree of influence, on the workings of men's minds and on
public opinion."
report, declared emphatically that
Unesco was already contributing to
peace, but he urged delegates to ask
themselves whether Unesco could not
make a larger and more immediate
contribution than it had made so far.
It was against fear, hatred and
misunderstanding which prevailed in
the world today that Unesco's activ-
ities should be set, said Sir John.
"They are modest but solid", he
added,"and they are the result of
countless acts of faith wrought by
men and women who have worked
for Unesco up and down the world
in the last few years".
Addressing the Conference on
behalf of M. Trygve Lie, Secretary-
General of the United Nations, M.
Henri Laugier, Assistant Secretary-
General, UN Department of Social
Affairs, said that had M. Lie been
able to attend, he would have
appealed to the governments repre-
sented at the Conference to give full
support to the UN Specialized Agen-
cies,"all of them victims, in varying
degrees, of the results of the cold
war".
Before the Conference opened a
number of important meetings were
held in Florence. The first of
these took place in the Palazzo Pitti,
where Unesco's Executive Board
. discussed and approved the provi-
sional conference agenda.
The draft programme before the
delegates consists, in fact, of two
programmes : a basic one which will
hold good for several years to come
and the programme for 1951, repre-
senting the part of the basic pro-
gramme to be carried out first.
100 ORGANIZATIONS
ACTIVITIES proposed for 1951require a budget of $ 8. 150. 000
- an increase of $ 150. 000 over the
1950 budget. (An outline of other im-
portant matters to be dealt with by
the Conference was given in the
last issue of the Courier.)
The second of the pre-conference
gathering was to enable representa-
tives of Unesco National Commis-
sions to discuss and define the most
effective means of co-operation in
carrying out Unesco's programme.
Finally, after the start of the Con-
ference, representatives from many
of the 100 non-governmental organ-
ization which have consultative
arrangements with Unesco, met for
the first time to consider the best
ways of future collaboration with
the Organization.
"I F the defences of peace are to bebuilt in the minds. of Mi n,
UNESCO must reach all the peo-
ples of the world with its message",
Mr. Martin Hill, representative of the
United Nations, told the UNESCO
Executive Board immediately prior
to the opening of the General Confe-
rence.
On behalf of Trygve Lie, Secretary-
General of the United Nations,
Mr. Hill pointed out the need for
greater universality in the member-
ship of UNESCO and of other Spe-
cialized Agencies of the United Na-
FOUR NEW UNESCO
MEMBER STATES
SHORTLY before, the FlorenceConference opened the Bri-
tish Foreign Office informed
Unesco that Costa Rica had
deposited its instruments of rati-
fication in London, thus becom-
ing the 56th Member State. As

press, the General Conference
admitted three new countries

and Korea-to membership of
the Organization.
tions. This is particularly urgent at
present in the view of the UN Secre-
tary-General, Mr. Hill said,"because
of the extremely critical situation of
the world".
"The division of the world into two
camps", the UN representative conti-
nued,"is utterly counter to the fun-
damental principles of the United
Nations. This situation can only lead
in the long run to world war. The
United Nations Specialized Agencies
are built on the conception of one
world and can function only if all the
peoples of the States which are mem-
bers really co-operate.
"The work of co-operation is now
being frustrated by the present cri-
tical divisions. Epidemics know no
frontiers. Health and narcotic con-
trols must obviously be worldwide if
they are to be effective".
"The Secretary-GeneraJ of the
United Nations", Mr. Hill said,"asks
if more cannot be done by the Spe-
cialized Agencies, especially UNESCO,
to cope with the immediate problems
of peace and war. adapting them
selves to the needs of the present cri-
tical situation. In this field UNESCO
has special powers because its motives
are not suspect, and it has great
possibilities of J4ass Communication
to carry its lDe8IIIo8Ø to mankind".

UNESCO COURIER-Page 10
"HUMANITY IS UNDER NO COMPULSION TO ABDICATE"
(Continued from Poge 1.)
Our authority is only of a moral
character. It cannot by itself produce
the political and economic decisions
which could limit armaments and halt
preparations for war. The path which
is set for us is assuredly long and
hard.
Far from discouraging us, the
difficulties of the present hour should
rather strengthen our resolve. Are
not freedom of the individual, and
respect for the dignity of man, the
very bases of the system set up by
the United Nations ? Without the
support of the common will of all the
peoples of the world, peace'... could be
no more than a truce, under constant
threat of new conflagrations.
I said : The peoples of the world,
and I want to make it clear that I
mean all the peoples of the world
without distinction of ideological
tendency or party. Yesterday you
heard from M. Laugier of the concern
of the Secretary-General of the United
Nations at the fact that, whether
from permanent abstention or what
I hope are temporary withdrawals,
not all the peoples are represented
at our meeting.
I share his concern, for an organiz-
ation dedicated to education, science
and culture cannot attain the kind
of universality essential to it merely
by increasing the number of its
member states. The universality of
the human spirit is not a matter of
arithmetic but consists essentially in
a unity with diversity of opinions,
systems and points of view. Without
that diversity UNESCO will not be
universal and unless in fact it does
séek to be universal I can see no
significance in it.
Our work, then, does not lie in the
domain where diplomats erect the
legal groundwork of peace. Our work
is less spectacular. We are dealing
with the very stuff of culture. Yet,
will culture ever be separable from
the political and social circumstances
which condition it ? For us peace
is not something taken for granted,
international understanding is not a
postulate. On the contrary, we
regard both one and the other as the
result of a series of efforts which must
be combined and harmonized, so as to
satisfy the longing for justice which
burns in man.
As every year, the fate of our
Organization is in your hands. You
have before you three main documents.
The first condenses, in the form of
specific resolutions, the programme
which the Executive Board proposes
to you for 1951. The second gives
you the budget estimates which the
Secretariat considers necessary for
carrying out the resolutions the Board
proposes. The third document, the
Basic Programme, justifies and ex-
plains the other two.
questions, added to the network of
non-governmental international orga-
nizations which collaborate with us,
place Unesco now and henceforward
in a position to undertake tasks on a
scale beyond that of the advice, the
suggestions, the token services to
which it has hitherto been confined.
A mere la"oratory 01 ftI, Odel tee,... aiqKes"
Laek 10'_tio__l resolutioll.
l'the 1951 programme gives us, in acertain measure, a pict re of
Unesco as it now is. The Basic
Programme, on the other hand, should
give us a picture of what Unesco may
become. The one limits and circum-
scribes our work. The other defines
our ambitions and, by defining them,
gives us encouragement.
I must not fail to point out to you
that these two documents are still
separated by an immense gulf. The
Secretariat will never be able to bridge
that gulf unaided. It is for Member
States and their peoples, by their
unselfish and resolute efforts, to do
sc.
I do not know what view you will
take of the programme submitted to
you by the Chairman of the Executive
Board. But I am bound to tell you
that, however concrete and consistent
it may appear to you when it leaves
your hands, it will remain a frail
thing until we frankly acknowledge
that the malaise from which Unesco
suffers is due not so much to a surfeit
of international"resolutions"as to a
lack of national resolution in each
country to put them into effect.
In my opinion it is important and
urgent to see that the programme
effectively combines the constructive
work that devolves upon Member
States with the function of liaison,
stimulation and co-ordination which
is the Secretariat's. Similarly, in
order to understand Unesco's real
situation, it would be desirable not
only to judge it by the Director-
General's Report, but to illuminate its
conclusions by an impartial study of
the reports sent in to the Organiz-
ation by Member States. In this
way the Member States and the secure-
tariat would be linked more closely
both by the programme and by the
various reports of activities.
Until these two conditions are
fulfilled, public opinion may look upon
our annual meetings as no more than
occasions for administrative exchanges
of views between the Governments
and the Secretariat. However indis-
pensable, however cogent, such ex-
changes may be for myself and my
collaborators, Unesco's mission cannot
be measured by the efforts of the
Secretariat alone. For that reason
it is of the first importance that these
general debates should also provide
the opportunity for another fruitful
encounter-the bringing face to face
before the Organization as a whole
the true instruments of our pro-
gramme, namely the States which
founded Unesco and which maintain
it. Only a confrontation of this
kind will enable every programme,
present or future, to be firmly rooted
in international fact. The concen-
tration of our work would be'of no
avail if it failed to satisfy the needs
of the peoples as they should find
expression in the Reports of Member
States. To be more practical, our
resolutions must be based upon a
study of those Reports. But for that
purpose, if you will allow me to say
so, the Reports must be at once fuller
and more precise than most of those
- and there are not very many of
them-that we have so far received.
A voicecrfling in tile wilderness"
AN examination of what each coun-try is doing for Unesco, of how it
is applying the recommendations
of the Conference, and of the response
evoked in the men for whom we work,
would provide a more solid basis to
our discussions. It would help us to
dispel the idea that our work is too
theoretical, and above all, it would
allow us more effectively to adapt
means and ends.
Doubtless many projects will be sub-
mitted to the present Session. All
those which promise to be valuable
to Unesco will assuredly be warmly
welcomed. Nevertheless, I hasten to
urge, even before I know them-for
later you might think that I was
taking exception to some specific pro-
ject-that, before presenting new
proposals, you should ask yourselves
in all sincerity :"Will the deleg-
ations who approve this or that pro-
posal be able to count upon their
governments for the full effort that
 will be needed if the proposal is not
to be rendered fruitless by niggard-
liness in its execution ?"
The effort I refer to must first of
all be financial. A programme
without a budget is a voice crying in
the wilderness. The day will come
- I hope so for the sake of my suc-
cessors-when critics will be
astonished that in May 1950 men who
believed in Unesco asked for only a
little more than eight million dollars
in order to carry out fof a year. in
fifty-six countries, a great inter-
national work of culture, science and
education.
The budget that you will be discus-
sing, however, was one that had to
accord with the resolutions proposed
by the Executive Board. It had to
take account of the spirit of the dis-
cussions of the General Conference
and, lastly, it could not disregard the
financial situation created by the fai-
lure of certain countries to pay their
contributions. If it was possible in
Paris, when considering an increase
of $220, 000 to accuse the administration
of Unesco of being"expansionist",
what, I wonder, would have been said
of an increase larger than that which
I am proposing to you ? Yet how
could I do other than strongly re-
commend this increase, believing as I
do that in the present circumstances
any curtailment of the Secretariat's
activities would delay for several
years the coming into being of that
living Unesco, of which the Secreta-
riat must in future be only the centre
of liaison ?
As I pointed out in my introduction
to the Budget Estimates, the small
increase of $150, 000 over the 1950
Budget is not quite enough to main-
tain the Secretariat's activities at
their present level. In fact it means
a reduction in the funds available for
those activities, because of the in-
crease in the unavoidable overheads of
a developing organization.
It is not only a matter of appro-
priations for the Secretariat. Many
of the National Commissions can have
only a paper existence until they too
are in possession of a budget allowing
them to undertake the surveys and
the work of information, consultation
and sometimes practical action, which
our Organization urgently requires of
them.
The time has come to redouble our
endeavours to embark resolutely upon
constructive work. The stage of
growth reached by the Organization,
the experience it has acquired in these
early years, the documentation it has
assembled and the surveys it has
carried out with regard to numerous
I MEAN tasks which, in a given fieldand for a particular area, would in-
volve a transformation of existing
conditions. Shall we for ever be
content to be a mere laboratory of
mod ? l techniques ? The peoples of
the earth do not respond to formulae,
but to achievements. And if inter-
national collaboration is to appear
ever more desirable to States, before
all it must show that it is effective.
It may be necessary to try out fresh
mthods committing Unesco's collec-
tive action to more immediate work
in connection with specific problems
of international importance. The
work of the Secretariat, as defined in
the programme, answers in the main
to a permanent need for intellectual
co-operation in the exchange of in-
formation, comparative research and
the dissemination of knowledge. As
such, and with the help of the Nation-
al Commissions and non-governmen-
tal international organizations, it
makes up a system of basic services
which an institution dedicated to the
promotion of the intellectual and
moral fellowship of man could not
rightly reduce.
But besides these permanent servi-
ces, there may be room for collective
undertakings by Member States-
along the lines worked out for tech-
nical assistance for economic deve-
lopment-for the solution of certain.
problems which may arise in a parti-
cularly acute form in one or another
part of the world and which present
an obstacle to the general progress
of mankind, if not a potential threat
to peace itself. As in the case of
technical assistance, we should have
to draw up a programme of specific
objectives to be realized in a given
number of years. Participation in
this scheme would be entirely volun-
tary and States could contribute to
it in the form of money, supplies or
services ; it would further be under-
stood that States directly benefiting
from the scheme would agree to fulfil
the conditions necessary for the suc-
cess of this international assistance.
Such schemes would benefit from
the services of the Secretariat as a
whole, and from any outside help that
might be forthcoming. All these
efforts would have to be co-ordinated
and combined for the purposes of a
concrete undertaking, and no longer
be scattered, as they so often are
to-day, over different specialized fields
of work. In this way Unesco would
give proof of unity in action, and at
the same time realize its true voca-
tion. In any case, for my part I
do not see any-other way in which
the Organization can advance from
the stage of investigation and
stimulation to the stage of practical
accomplishment, so long as its ordinary
Budget remains at the present figure
or until Member States play a very
much larger part in the carrying out
of the programme.
I have spoken of the financial effort
that devolves on Member States.
There is also the moral effort. Par-
ticipation in our work cannot consist
solely in paying a subscription into
the Secretariat's account. Without
the moral contribution of every people,
the financial contribution by their
Governments would be ineffectual.
Can we fail to see that the spiritual
conditions in which Unesco works,
have changed since 1945 ? The breath
of human fellowship that we felt
about us when we met in London has
steadily weakened. A dark cloud of
anxiety has veiled the high hopes
that inspired us when, while the
nations were joined in the last battles
for liberation, we laid the moral and
intellectual foundations of permanent
co-operation in the cause of peace.
Dave we all the tiMe we need ?
IN several respects the situation to-day is worse than at which faced
the world at the end of first'World
War. Never, in time of peace, has
travel been so necessary and physically
so easy, yet administratively so cum-
bersome and difficult. The fron-
tiers, closed with barbed wire in
the war, are still dotted with firmly-
entrenched customs posts and weari-
some controls of currency and pass-
ports. Before, it was the armaments
merchants who were suspect ; now
even scholars and poets are regarded
with mistrust. Everywhere we see
conflict, or provocation to conflict,
between ideologies which consider
themselves irreconcilable. We are
trying to remove from children's
history books a few tendentious pages,
a few prejudiced versions of events.
Yet we show no particular alarm
when we see grown-up people applaud-
ing in the newspapers and on the
screen, in books or on the stage,
everything that flatters nationalist
self-esteem, even though it must
wound the answering sensibilities of
other nations.
Because of the fields in which it
operates, and of the nature of its
methods, Unesco, in carrying out its
mission of peace, must mainly focus
upon the future. The deeper it
enters into its tasks the more time
will it take to show results ; for the
habits of thought and feeling, which
are the substance as well as the ins-
truments of its activity, call for patient
and difficult adaptation. But are we
sure that we have all the time we
need ? That is a question we cannot
escape from. And even if peace is
maintained, is it fitting that we should
not have helped in maintaining it ?
The future is child of the present.
If we stand aside to-day, we shall
forfeit the authority to win acceptance
for our ideal tomorrow.
As I said to you in Beirut when
accepting the position to which you
had elected me, it is our duty to make
of Unesco the conscience of the United
Nations, and conscience can never
stand aside from the main stream of
history. Therefore Unesco must
associate more closely in the work
of the United Nations. Admittedly,
its strictly technical sphere is different
from that of the political organization
of which it is a specialized agency.
But that should not prevent it from
taking its part to-day in the defense
of peace-remembering that never
before have education, science, culture
and mass communication been such
important factors in political action
and practice.
It is said that Leonardo da Vinci
onca uttered these despairing words :
"Hate sees more clearly than love".
Let us not be defeated by such
pessimism, against which Leonardo
himself so ardently fought. Were
not the smiles of the Gioconda and
of St. Anne painted after he had said
this ? We ask ourselves to-day what
suffering he had to endure in order
to give being to those two smiles,
which have in them such infinite
wisdom and forgiveness. No !-for
Leonardo, hate was not more clair-
voyant than goodness. Nor will it
be so for us. After all, if civilization
has continued it is because, like the
smiles of those unforgettable faces,
every culture contains the message of
a hope that has been tempered and
purified by grief.
!"I. lltiJlfllor ø lello..,."". llree _øa"
UNLESS it is accompanied by socialprogress, material progr ss carries
with it an immense danger. And
how can we imagine social progress
without a fair chance for all of an
education that liberates each one,
without the consolation of a culture
in which each one can flnd his
happiness ? Unesco's very name
indissolubly links the trinity of science,
culture and education. The realities
to which those words correspond
require towards all three of them an
equal loyalty. In a world from which
science were missing, culture would
again become subservient to magic,
and education would decline into an
automatic and tyrannical machine.
On the other hand, in a world where
progress depended solely upon science
- where education lacked the influence
of humanism, and culture was
without warmth or vitality, where
power would end by outgrowing the
capacity of the mind that controlled
it-the inventor would be merely
the victim of his inventions. Van-
quished by his own victories, conquered
by his conquests, Man, placed between
the tyranny of technical triumph and
the responsibility of freedom, would
no longer know how to choose.
Happily, humanity is under no
compulsion to abdicate in order to
continue its onward march. The
peace we aspire to would be a poor
pretense if we thought to build it
upon the repudiation of science, the
restriction of teaching, or the placing
of culture in leading strings. On the
contrary Unesco is fighting for a
fellowship of free men, a fellowship
of human beings capable of full self-
expression and genuine self-realization.
It is only with men thus worthy of
the name of mn that we shall be
able to assure a true peace.
May your debates, gentlemen, be
Inspired by the ideal of such a peace !

,'T HE problem we have to face", said Dr. Francis Bourrey, leaning
against one of two huge silver trucks towering above him in a
Paris garage,"is to hunt up sick people ourselves, instead of
waiting for them to come to us".
Dr. Bourrey was speaking in his capacity as president of the
Social Affairs Commission of the Assembly of the French Union, where
he represents French Nigeria.
As the result of his efforts over the past four years, a travelling X-ray
laboratory and doctor's office will
spend the next two-and-a-half years
picking its way over the dirt roads
of French Nigeria to track down the
country's sore spots of disease and
ill-health. The trucks left France
late in April and were due to"report
for work"in Nigeria during May or
early June.
The roving laboratory belongs to
the people of Nigeria, the national
assembly of French Nigeria having
voted to finance the purchase of the
two trucks and their equipment.
Dr. Bourrey led the way inside
one of the huge seven-ton vehicles
and pointed to a map of French
Nigeria on the wall of the room
which will serve as office for Dr.
Claude Vigan, chief of the mission.

French and British Nigeria, the
map was well sprinkled with
towns and intersected by highways.

He ran his hand over the interior

only faint dotted lines on the map.

going", he said."There are frout

tors have run into strong opposition
from the nomadic population of
French Nigeria when they attemp-
ted to conduct large-scale health
examinations. The Nigerians were
suspicious of strangers.
To help overcome this suspicion,
Ihe mission is using the tried tech-
nique of motion pictures, but with
It new approach. One of the trucks
rarries a motion-picture projector
and supplies of films, mostly ani-
mated cartoons, on health and sani-
tation subjects.
A Voice They Know
WHEN the trucks arrive in a vil-lage, Dr. Bourrey said, the
films will first be shown to the
chief of the, area and explained to
him. Then, he will make a com-

To enlist the active interest of the American people,whose food standards are high, in the task of
lifting the standards of the one-half of the world's
people who are badly fed, the United States Natio-
nal Commission for UNESCO has launched a nation-
wide educational campaign on the problems of Food and
People.
The practical purpose is to stimulate discussion in
communities and organizations in all parts of the United
States on the need for national and international action
to face the problem of a rapidly increasing world popu-
lation not yet matched by increased food production.
The campaign, officially begun at the semi-annual
meeting in Washington, D. C., of the National Commis-
sion, is being carried out with the co-operation of the
United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the
U. S. State Department and Agriculture Department, the
FAO Inter-Agency Committee of the U. S. Government,
schools and universities throughout the country, and ma-
ny national, state and local private organizations repre-
senting farm, labour, consumer and other interests.
A Food and People"Fact Sheet", one of 18 separate
items distributed to interested organization points out
that :"Only one-third of the world's people get enough
of the right kind of food, and they consume three-fourths
of the world's food supply. One half of the human race
actllally goes hungry, and famine and starvation still
stalk the earth, as in ancient times."
Six Unesco booklets set forth various.. aspects of the
problems presented by the need to feed a constantly
rising population, an estimated increase of 68, 000 per-
sons daily.-
will be taken down on a wire recor-
der.
Later, when the film is shown to
a native audience, it will he explain-
ed to them in the voice and on the
authority of their own leader, in a
language they can understand.
After the showing, the audience
will be examined for tuberculosis
and given blood-tests. This year,
it is hoped that 100, 000 will past
before the X-ray CameI'll in tile mis-
sion's medical truck.
Dr. Bourrey expects the mission
to accomplish its survey at the end
of two-and-a-half years, covering
more than 25, 000 miles each year.
During the rainy season, when
French Nigeria's roads become im-
passable, the mission will make its
headquarters in a city and examine
the local population.
Both trucks were specially de-
signed and built for the job. One of
them is used as the laboratory,
while the other serws mainly as
living quarters.
The laboratory truck is divided
into two main rooms, housing the
X-ray camera and the doctor's office.
This truck is a) so equipped with an
operating table for emergency cases,
although surgery is not part of its
mission.
An Example For Others
THE second truck is equipped
with housing facilities easily
the equivalent of those found
in many small homes. One room
incorporates a double bunk, an elec-
tric stove, a refrigerator and a
shower bath as well as closets and
cupboards. This truck also con-
tains a darkroom, for the develop-
ing of X-ray plates, and a 10-kilo-
watt electric generating plant.
Both of the vehicles are atr-com-
ditioned and built with four layer
of insulation to permit their person-
nel to work in Nigerian tempera-
tures, which often reach 115 degrees
Fahrenheit.
The front ends of both trucks are
Luilt in two stories, one servin ! 5' as
the driver's cab and the other as'a
compartment big enough to seat
four persons or sleep two.
In operation, the two trucks will

tent stretched between them. The
area under the tent will serve as a
waiting room.
"This praticulOl'mission is inten-
ded only to serve Nigeria", Dr. Bour-
rey said."But we hope that its
example will bring other African
countries to follow suet."

### School nuclei' bring new hope for the Andes
UNESCO COURIER-Page 12
OUTPOSTS IN A FIGHT AGAINST DESPAIR.
SCHOOL NUCLEI BRING NEW HOPE
of the Inca empire are only
THE town of Cuzco, perched on a high plateau of theAndes, still contains vestiges of the empire of the
Incas, whose capital it was. All round the town the
ruins of temples bear witness to the lost civilization.
Other remains, less spectacular, but perhaps more signi-
ficant, such as planted terraces on the mountainsides and
irrigation installations, show the high degree of accom-
plishment which it reached.
On these now desolate mountain heights live the
descendants of the Incas. Comprising 46% of the popu-
lation of Peru, they are therefore an important ethnic
group.
But the wealth and glory
a memory. The descendants
of the Incas live in direst
poverty. Mostly illiterate,
they lack even the most
elementary knowledge. They
have forgotten the arts of
their ancestors and have
not acquired the modern
techniques that might help
them live decently. Their
helplessness and resignation
present many problems in
addition to that of restoring
dignity and self-respect.
For example, despite the
fact that 64 per cent of the
whole population of Peru
works in agriculture, the
country has to import the
greater part of its food
supply.
The bad conditions in
way of life. Each nucleus
has, besides its Director, a
team of educators special-
ized in various subjects :
agricultural techniques and
the conservation of the soil,
health and hygiene, the
Spanish language.
Teachers Have Twin
Tasks
THESE specialists aretrained at seminars
organized jointly by the
Bolivian and Peruvian Go-
vernments with the help of
the Inter-American Co-
operative Service for the
Production of Foodstuffs.
Their first task is the actual
construction of the"school
nuclei", built in the local
style, with thatched roofs,
letting in plenty of light and
aim. Besides teaching duties,
each member of the team is
responsible for looking after
all the school buildings in
the area in which the"nu-
cleus"has been set up. He
has, indeed, not only to
look after them but also, if
possible, to improve them.
Obviously, the education
of the children cannot of
itself suffice to change the
living conditions of so many
people. Adult education is
therefore an important fac-
tor in the task or the
"school nuclei". The teach-
ers attached to them can
undertake to impart know-
ledge of such matters as soil
conservation, agricultural
techniques and domestic
training.
An Escape From
Misery
IT is difficult to giveinstruction in hygiene to
people who, rather than call
a doctor or allow themsel-
ves be vaccinated, prefer
to call medicine men. In
any case, the proportion of
doctors in the Cuzco district
is one to 40, 000 inhabitants.
Nevertheless in Bolivia
and Peru, the new"` schools
nuclei"will soon give the
Indians a chance to escape
from the misery to which
history reduced them cen-
turies ago. It is hoped that
this work will result not
only in increased agricultu-
ral production and an im-
proved standard of living,
but also in closer relations
between the two main
groups of the population.
"Othet remains, perhaps more significant. such as planted terraces on
the mountainsides and irrigation installations, show the high degree 01
accomplishment reached by the Inca civilization."The Incas built beau-
tüul cities, like hanging gardens on the craggy summits 01 the Andes,
such as Machupicchu, whose terraces and ruined fortress are shown in
this photo. Today, the governments be Peru and Bolivia are helping the
descendants 01 the Incas to escape from the misery to which history
reduced them centuries ago.
which a great many South
American Indians now live
result from historical cir-
cumstances no longer oper-
ative. The achievements of
their ancestors are proof of
the gifts and capabilities of
the race. There is. the
greatest promise, therefore,
in helping to develop their
capabilities. The first step
is to educate them ; to
teach them to read, to culti-
vate their land and to care
for themselves.
Joint Attack On
Ignorance
m particularly inte-
resting experiment of
this kind has been
undertaken by Peru and
Bolivia. Faced with similar
problems, the two countries
decided to solve them by
joint action. The Ministries
of Education, Social Affairs
and Agriculture of both
countries have, with the
help of the Inter-American
Co-operative Service for
Food Production, drawn up
a fundamental education
programme which already
has some achievements to
its credit.
The first problem was
how to improve the school
system. In some parts of
Peru, such as Cuzco, for
instance, 88 per cent. of the
children do not go to school.
The primary reason is that
communities are widely
scattered and means of
communication s c a r c e.
Defects in the organization
of the school system aggra-
vate the situation : a lack
of school buildings, and of
amenities in such buildings
as do exist, and faulty
training of teachers. Most
of the teaching is in
Spanish, but the Indian
children speak only their
own languages-Quecha
and Aimara.
The first and most im-
portant step taken at the
beginning of the campaign
was the establishment of
"school nuclei". These are
staffed by specially trained
teachers who speak the
languages of the Indians
and are familiar with their

life, as witness his research work on radar, sa-

Saint-Exupery excelled both in music and ma-
thematics. His posthumous < Citadelle >

### Science is everyone's business
Pap I 3-UNESCO COURIER
SCIENCE ITS EVERYONE'S BUSI
FIVE young men were preparing to leave Bordeaux, France last month to sail
around the world in a 46 foot (14. 5 metres) catamaran, a double-hull boat whose
construction is based on a 2, 000 yearold Polynesian model. The five young men
are.'scientists". It will be at least five years before they return from the voyage
in their vessel, the.'Copula", During that time they expect to have demonstrated that
every person can be a scientist. For these voyagers ordinarily earn their livings,- _... _........ 4-....... lT".........-.......-.... 1.......-+l.-t : } Jt \' ; 1I1VC1'y, ( :\i ) ø. UIC. l\, ; Uø. UII,
a sculptor, an engineer, ansculptor, a  engineer, an
architect, and a film tech-
nician. Apart from the
engineer, they are all ama-
teur scientists. To full-
time professional scientists
these adventurers have
suddenly become valued
colleagues.
On behalf of a number
of French scientific institu-
tions, which have given
them short training courses
and supplied them with
simple instruments, they
are to make some investi-
gations-that is to learn
in detail things which have
never been known before.
Nothing elaborate, but the
collection of useful data.
For example, they have
been asked to obtain wher-
ever possible samples of
the oil from the liver of
the shark and to study the
effect of different waters
and different climates on
under-water paint.
Their notes read, in part :
"The crew will undertake to
record the boat's course
and speeds, to take the
surface temperature of the
water daily, if possible, at
the same hour, to note the
state of the-sea, and to log
the different ports of call,
the length of stay in each
port, and to indicate
whether the boat was in
dry dock. around or
afloat".
Miracle Maker Myth
A LTHOUGH amateurs, ifthey proceed bout the
collection of facts care-
fully they will be acting as
scientists. They have very
many famous predecessors :
Isaac Newton was a public
official ; Leeuwenhoek. the
father of microscopy, was a
Dutch merchant Benjamin
Franklin was a printer ; Chris-
tian Sprengler, who made
some of the first studies of
insect pollination, was a mi-
nister ; Herschel was an orga-
nist ; Joseph Priestley was a
divine who dabbled in che-
mistry ; Charles Darwin was
a country gentleman ; Gregor
Mendel, pioneer in genetics,
was a monk ; and Henri Fabre,
great investigator of the
insect world, was a school-
teacher in a French country
town.
The world-renowned British
Royal Society sprang up from
the efforts of a group of ama-
teurs. In the 18th and 19th
centuries it was only the
amateur who could make a
contribution as a scientist.
for science was the pursuit of
a leisured class, a gentlemanly
activity. This contributed in
part to the myth that has
grown up through the years
following that the scientist
is a being apart, a miracle-
maker who moves in special
ways his mysteries to perform.
This false view has been
reinforced in our century by
the fact that for many inves-
tigations mighty machines
and instruments are neces-
sary : for example, the elec-
tron microscope and the mass
spectrometer, the radio-active
isotope and the cyclotton. It
has come to be accepted that
to do scientific research much
equipment is needd.
A FLOATING"LABORATÓRY". In this double. huUed catamaran the
"Copula", five young men are setting out from Bordeaux, France, on a
round-the-world trip. During their live years'voyage they will collact
useful data for a number of French scientific institutions.
It is true that this is the
age of the organized scien-
tific worker, who is a phe-
nomenon of the last quar-
ter-century. It is since the
first world war that there

"At an early age he abandon-

Pascal was then twelve years

When he was sixteen he

In the preface to the catalo-

on the astonishing intellectual

thinker and experimenter."His

earn their livelihood in
research laboratories. But the
amateur still has a contribu-
tion to make. His equipment
need be only as limited as
that belonging to Dr. Wollas-
ton, the great chemist and
physicist who was president
of the Royal Society in 1820.
"bering Up
My Laboratory"
SIR Richard Gregory in hisdelightful book"Disco-
very", tells how a foreign
scientist called on Wollaston
and asked to be shown round
his laboratory."Certainly",
said Wollaston, and rang the
bell."John,"he told the at-
tendant who entered,"bring
up my laboratory". Where-
upon John went out and re-
turned in a few minutes with
all Wollaston's apparatus on a
tea tray.
Even children have a proper
role to play as amateur scien-
tists, according to Benjamin
Franklin, who wrote :"Much
of it falls within the Capacity
of Persons, even of Children.
It consists of attending the
objects with which Nature pre-
sents us, in considering them
with Care, and admiring their
proper Beauties, etc..."
What the Rev. J. G. Wood,
an English clergyman and
amateur natural historian,
wrote in 1861 is still valid
today :"there is little doubt
but that if any one with an
observant mind were to set
himself to work determinately,
merely at the study of the
commonest weed or the most
familiar insect, he would, in
the course of some years'
patient labour, produce a
work that would be most
valuable to science".
Root Of All Research
THIS view was underlinedvigrously by Mr. E -
mond W. Sinnott, retir-
ing president of the American
Association for the Advance-
ment of Science, last Decem-
ber."'We sometimes forget
the still vast areas where
facts and principles of great
scientific value may be disco-
vered with no more complex
tools or techniques than are
at the command of any intel-
ligent layman", he said.
"Even to list all these
would be impossible here.
The exact distribution of
plant and animal species, the
records of flowering dates
through the years, the varia-
bility of wild species, bird
censuses and the records of
bird migration, the collection
and identification of fossils,
the distribution of minerals,
detailed local weather obser-
vations, records of meteorites
and of variable stars.
"Let us not disparage such
work as'anecdotal', as'mere'
natural history, simply be-
cause experiment and complex
apparatus play relatively
minor parts in it. Intelligent
observation is at the tot tom
of all research and opportu-
nities for this are almost
limitless. There is ample
room in science for the efforts
of a vast body of enthusiastic
laymen".

nYlNG village in the heart of the burned out Landes countryside
of southern France will spring back to life this summer when
volunteers from the wo ld's work camps meet in Sa gnac-et-
Muret to help the local people restore their homes.
For Saugnac-et-Muret, once a happy village of 1800 inhabitants, and
now deserted by all but 650, as a result of repeated forest fires, has been
chosen as the site for the most representative work camp project ever
planned. Young men and women from all over the world will meet there
this summer to build farms, repair houses, construct roads, restore the
soil and turn Saugnac into a model village.
Behind this ambitious Unesco
supported project, being carried out
under the auspices of the French
National Commission for Unesco,
with the financial backing of
International Rotary, is an intense
young man with dark curly hair and
weatherbeaten cheeks-Jean
Guichot.
It was Jean Guichot who, by his
own example, first started things
moving in Saugnac. If he had
stayed in Agen, 150 kilometres away,
instead of returning to his grand-
mother's farm in Saugnac ; if he
had continued his studies and
become a doctor like his father and
grandfather before him, attention
might never have been turned on
this little village in the Landes, and
it would have sunk further into
desolation and decay.
SCORCHED EARTH EXODUS
tt UT, in 1942, Guichot and hisfamily did return to the old
homestead. That year fire
struck the village. And again the
following year. Thousands of pine
trees, the collection of whose resin
forms the principal means of
livelihood for the people of the
Landes, were destroyed. And more
and more villagers, their homes and
livelihood gone, moved away to the
towns.
Minding his sheep and riding over
the charred land, Guichot thought
up ways of solving the problem. To
check the fires, he decided, the
"LaTtdaM"must resort to the
practices of their ancestors-keep
20 per cent of the land under
cultivation, breed more sheep which
would eat up the undergrowth, plant
trees less densely, and make
clearings.
When vast stretches of the Landes
were destroyed by fire last year and,
with his neighbours, he had spent
three weeks fighting the flames, Jean
Guichot decided the time had come
to put his plan into action. He called
a meeting and, with the help of
French officials, persuaded land-
There are roads to build, houses and
farms to repair, and a centre for
youth activities and culture to be
created.
Jean Guichot's plan will also be
the starting point for the carrying
out of plans for the development of
the Landes already drawn up by the
French authorities.
NEW HOPE IN THE LANDES
G UICHOT put his plan beforeUnesco's Reconstruction De-
partment and Unesco's French
National Commission."Wtth. the
help of international youth", he said,
we can gain valuable time. You can
help us greatly by arranging for
volunteers and funds and providing
Us with cultural facilities".
The project was put before the
third conference of organizers of
international work camps which met
at Unesco House last month. The
Co-ordination Committee, set up by
Unesco, suggested that all the
organizations take part, and all the
representatives present agreed.
Details are now being worked out,
but already it has been decided to
organize three work camps in
Saugnac this summer. Three French
organizations-Jeunesse et Recons-
truction, Pax Romana, and Service
Civil International-have under-
taken to run them. Other organiza-
tions, like the American Friends
Service Committee, the International
Youth Hostel Federation, student
groups from England, Denmark,
Switzerland, Sweden and Germany
will send volunteers.
These camps will herald a cultural
and educational campaign in the
Landes through the use of travelling
libraries-and scientific exhibitions
and educational films.
M. Guichot, who came to Pari
early in May to put his ideas and
plans before the organizers, returned
to Saugnac a happy man. Soon his
village will be bustling with activity,
echoing with the sound of hammers
and saws, and of many tongues.
And Saugnac-et-Muret will become
a symbol of new hope for the people
of the Landes.
He told of watching the Organiza-
tion grow from a Membership of 39
to 56. He has also seen it grow in
experience. Above all he has watched
it bring in people from many dif-
ferent countries who have learned to
work for the same objectives.
In going to the Institute of Inter-
national Education, : \or. Holland said
he did not feel he Is completely leav-
ing Unesco, as the Institute, is ar-
ranging for the exchange of persons
and dealing with Unesco Fellowship
recipients in the United States, is in
fact carrying out part of Unesco's
programme.
Mr. Holland stressed the importance
of periodically reviewing and re-
examining Unesco's programme, in
speaking of the recent meeting which
he attended of the U. S. National Com-
mission in washington. The Com-
mission, for this meeting, had chosen
as its theme"A Fresh Look at Unesco
- its Method-its Reach-its Impact",
because it was felt that after 4 years
it. was time to re-assess its objectives
and its programme. The principal
emphasis was on"Unesco-wide pro-
jects"designed to co-ordinate various
fields of Unesco's work. It was
considered the best example of this
was the administrative plan worked
out for a technical assistance pro-
gramme with a co-ordinating unit in
the Organization.
The Commission discussed two such
projects :
(1) a greatly expanded programme
in Germany ; and
(2) a greatly expanded programme
in the field of Human Rights.
Mr. Holland has attended every
Unesco General Conference since the
Organization came into being, and he
would prize, he said, the acquaintan-
ces and friends he had made at these
conferences and in the Secretariat.
Before taking up his new duties he
will go to Florence in June for the
latter part of this year's General Con-
ference.
MR. KENNETH HOLLAND, authority on international education, and Perma-
nent United States Delegate to Unesco since February 1948, has
resigned from that post to accept appointment as President of the
Institute of International Education. He will take up his new duties in New
York in Juicy.
Before his departure from Unesco, Mr Holland, in an interview with
the"Courier", left a message of encouragement for all those who work for
and with the Organization."Unesco's task wiU take many years", he said,
"but the objectives of the Organization as laid down in the Constitution at
the London Conference in 1945, are still valid, and deserve the full support
of Member. Stators, Nun-Governmental OJ'ganizations and the many individulIf. i
who are interested in peace through understanding".

### Films in India show the road ahead
Page) 5-UNESCO COURtER
FILMS IN INDIA SHOW THE ROAD AHEAD
WHEN the new road came to Kurvandi, an old village in rural India, it broughtmore than merely a physical change in the landscape. It brought also a thou-
sand changes in habits of social and personal life that had remained almost
the same in Kurvandi, as in countless other Indian villages, for many hundreds of
years. The people of Kurvandi soon came to understand the value of the road.
But those in other villages did not.
To teach the millions of men and women in rural India the benefits of change
is one of the major goals of the Government of India. Few problems are greater
and more urgent than the need to show the people the advantages of replacing old
habits, customs and superstitions with modern methods of living.. As an important
means of coping with this
problem, the Government
is using educational and
documentary films, simple
in content, personal in
approach, slower in tempo
than ordinary films, and
made to fit the special
needs and conditions of
people in rural areas.
One of these is <&lt; Kur-
vandi Road ;), made by the
Paul Zils'documentary unit
for the United Nations, and
acquired by the Govern-
ment of India for wide dis-
tribution by projectors on
mobile vans in villages
which lack electricity. The
technique both of the pre-
sentation of images and
narrative is intended to
influence and persuade
simple people of the value
and urgency of co-opera-
tion for community better-
ment. The story of the
benefits the road brought
to Kurvandi is made per-
sonal by the device of
an intimate commentary
spoken as if by the villagers
themselves.
The villagers did in fact havej. a. part in the m king of
the film. When Zils and
his unit came to Kurvandi, he
asked their co-operation, and
they suggested angles of
thought and approach which
were stronger and more effect-
ive than any he had planned
in advance.
'Kurvandi Road"attracted
considerable attention when it
was shown at the Third In-
ternational Festival of Docu-
mentary Films at Edinburgh,
Scotland.
Another film made by the
Zils unit, which is being dis-
tributed by the Government as
part of its programme of
intensive rural education by
films, is"A Tiny Thing Brings
Death". Instead of the charts
and drawings usual in scienti-
fic documentaries, this uses a
simple story of village life to
illustrate the cause and pre-
vention of malaria.
Most of the films for rural
use are being made for the
Government of India, by a
new organization called In-
dian Documentary Films, part
of the Films Division or the
Ministry of Information and
Broadcasting, under the di-
rection of M. Bhavnani, one of
the best known personalities
in the Indian cinema. Pre-
pared in four languages-Hin-
dustani, Gujerati, Bengali and
Tamil, the films tackle a va-
riety of present-day social and
economic problems.
Food storage, for example, is
treated in a film entitled"War
on Waste". The need for bet-

building. Octogonal in shape, the"New Theatre"haa no balcony, the auditorium being
pitched at a steep grade to give the audience a more intimate relationship with the stageand permitting improved acoustica.
TODAY is a time of renaissance in the world of theatre-a"stout
thread for the fabric of a world society", as J. B. Priestley has
described it. War-damaged theatres are being reconstructed all
over Europe and new theatres being built throughout the world.
For this reason, and as a prelude to the Third Congress of the Inter-
national Theatre Institute (LT. L) which opens on June 22nd, an Inter-
national Theatre Architecture Exhibition and Conference will be held in
Paris from June 19th to 21st.
Theatre architects in all countries are ready to share their knowledge
for the common aim of making each new theatre as perfect as possible ;
to provide the best range of vision and the most effective system of acous-
tics so that audiences can best appreciate the team work of producers,
actors and stage technicians.
The Paris exhibition and conference will therefore be an effective way
of"pooling"available knowledge and demonstrating up-to-date techni-
ques.

SPEAKERS from more than ten countries will share the benefit of theirexperience with architects, producers, actors, designers and stage
technicians taking part, on such questions as"the value and use of

So that a wide audience can benefit from the work of the conference,
the lectures and discussions are later to be published in pamphlet form.

### U.N. Technical assistance mission surveys needs of Indonesia
UNESCO COURIER-Page 16
U. N. TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE MISSION
SURVEYS NEEDS
OF INDONESIA
The United Nations and specialized
agencies have assumed certain
broad responsibilities for helping
their members to obtain the techni-
cal assistance needed for their economic
development. To carry out these responsi-
bilities, they have created machinery, within
their organizations, initiated studies of the
types of assistance required and provided,
on many occasions, the technical advice or
other assistance for which the requests
were received.
Today, the United Nations and special-
ized agencies are preparing an expanded
co-operative programme of technical assis-
tance to under-deveioped countries. The first action
under this programme was the recent despatch to
Djakarta, capital of the young Republic of Indonesia, in
answer to a government request, of a joint technical
assistance mission of experts.
Headed by Dr. Ansgar Rosenborg, Special Assistant
to the UN Assistant Secretary-General in charge of
Economic Affairs, the mission was last month consulting
with the Indonesian authorities on their existing plans
for economic development and. seeking to determine in
what field assistance was most needed.

Mr Akrawi Iwas also a member of
the Unesco Educational Mission to
Afghanistan, last year.
In Indonesia, he has been
consulting with the Government
on the provision by Unesco of
technical assistance in fundamental
education, natural and applied
sciences, mass communications and
the provision of international
training facilities for Indonesians
in these fields, as part of the total
plan for the economic development
of Indonesia.
Reflecting the broad scope of
technical assistance was the
inclusion in the mission of
representatives of three UN special-
ized agencies-a point stressed by
Mohammad Hatta, Indonesia's
Prime Minister, when he welcomed
the group at the Indonesian Fo-
reign Office.
"You gentlemen are here", he
continued,."primarily to explore the
possibilities of such collaboration in
the economic field. The composition
of your mission-including as it
does experts in agriculture, education
and health-indicates, however,

increased by 10 % only, whilsf the population increased by 2N %.
said the Indonesian Prime Minister
"we do need a good ideal of help.
For nearly a decade, large areas of
Indonesia have been cut off from
normal contact with other coun-
tries and at the same time have
suffered heavy destruction. There
is urgent need of rehabilitation and

"social engineering"generally.

concluded,,"we are mindful also of
our responsibilities as a member-

yet-of the family of nations. Itis our fervent hope that as time goes
on we may be able to make an
increasing contribution to the welfare
