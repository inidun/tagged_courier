United States
Youth with a rose
During the 18th and early 19th century America developed an art that strongly reflected the life of the
times. Much of it was the achievement of self-taught painters. In works outstanding for their home¬
spun beauty and decorative qualities these artists compiled a memorable record of the American
past : scenes from everyday life, views of the countryside and towns of the New World before the
industrial age and portraits that are sometimes spiced with a mischievous touch of caricature. This
early American portrait of a youth holding a rose was painted about 1710 by an unknown artist.

This issue of the "Unesco
Courier" marks the
bicentennial of the American
Declaration of Independence
on 4 July 1776 and the
founding of the United
States as an independent
nation. This was the first
anti-colonial revolution of
modern times and prepared
the way for the French
Revolution thirteen years
later. Articles and photo
stories look retrospectively
at some of the major
historic events and
personalities of the
American Revolution 200
years ago and in the
perspective of the American
people today.

AMERICA'S
SPIRIT OF 1776
by Henry Steele Commager
HENRY STEELE COMMAGER is one ol the most distinguished scholars on American
history at work today. Since 1930 when he published his first major work The Growth of the
American Republic (written in collaboration with the late Samuel Eliot Morison) he has produced
a regular flow of major contributions to the literature of American history. Notable among his
publications are a monumental source book Documents of American History (1934) which he
edited (also with S.E. Morison) and the classic America : Story of a Free People (1942) written
with Allan Nevlns. Professor of American History at Amherst College (Mass.) since 1956. he
has held many academic posts at universities ¡n the United States and elsewhere. This article
has been condensed from "The Revolution as a World Ideal", first published In Saturday Review
of 13 December 1975.

### America's spirit of 1776
SKYSCRAPERS OF YESTERDAY AND TODAY. Left, "Historical Monument
of the American Republic", painted about 1876 by Erastus Salisbury Field to
celebrate the first centenary of the United States. In this huge canvas
(4 m. x 3 m.) the artist filled almost every inch of each of its ten towers
with dazzling representations of the important figures, events and texts of
American history from the earliest periods onwards. On the second tower
from the right. Field depicted historic incidents in the American Revolution.
Linking the tops of the 150-metre "skyscrapers" is a steam railway on which
a half dozen steam engines are merrily puffing away. Field began his
monumental work in réponse to a competition for the design of the central
building at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition of 1876. He hoped that his
monument would one day be constructed. Below, towers of 1976
60-story office and residential blocks in Marina City, Chicago.
THE men who fought the Revo¬
lution and created the new
American nation were children of the
Enlightenment. They shared the En¬
lightenment conviction that mankind
was one, that men were everywhere
alike subject to the same laws, res¬
ponding to the same impulses, animat¬
ed by the same passions, and enti¬
tled to the same rights.
They believed in the sovereignty of
reason and in the universality of
those laws which reason could com¬
mand and in the ability to achieve
those ends which reason dictated as
just and sound. When they set up their
own commonwealths, they based
these on laws they thought universal
and permanent; and they took it for,
granted that men and nations every¬
where must eventually follow where
they led.
With Patrick Henry they were con¬
fident that America had "lighted the
candle to all the world." With John
Adams they rejoiced that the Revolu¬
tion was fought "for future millions,
and millions of millions," and that it
would "spread Liberty and Enlight¬
enment everywhere in the world".
No one else proclaimed this gospel
more insistently than Thomas Jeffer¬
son. "We feel," he wrote to his friend
Joseph Priestley, "that we are acting
under obligations not confined to the
limits of our own society. It is impos¬
sible not to be sensible that we are
acting for all mankind."
And he struck that note again in his
last letter: it was his salute to the "Ar¬
gonauts" who had launched the Dec¬
laration and the nation: "May it be to
the world... the signal of arousing men
to burst the chains under which mon
kish ignorance and superstition had
persuaded them to bind themselves,
and to assume the blessings and
security of self-government... All eyes
are opened, or opening, to the rights
of man.
"The general spread of the light
of science has already laid open to
every view the palpable truth that the
mass of mankind has not been born
with saddles on their backs, nor a
favoured few booted and spurred,
ready to ride them legitimately, by the
grace of God."
It is sobering to reflect that in cele¬
brating both the Centennial and the
Bicentennial of the Revolution, Am¬
ericans have been content to substi¬
tute rhetoric for policy and have even
been willing to permit the. policy to
betray the rhetoric. The Revolutionary ^
generation translated its rhetoric ther

### America's spirit of 1776
^term is inadequate not only into
policy but also into institutions.
Nothing, indeed, was more impres¬
sive in that generation than its ability
"to realize the writings of the wisest
writers" that is, to take ideas and
principles to which philosophers had
subscribed for centuries and institu¬
tionalize them.
As the Founding Fathers drew upon
the great heritage of the past, from
Greece to 17th century England, for
their inspiration, so they contrived
institutions that were valid everywhere
and that spread over the globe.
First they created a nation some¬
thing no other people had ever done
before, for heretofore nations had
simply grown. And they did so with¬
out benefit of all the insignia and stig¬
mata of Old World nationalism a
monarch, a ruling class, an establish¬
ed church, an army and navy, and even
a historical past. What is more, they
cast the nation into Republican form
something Montesquieu had assert¬
ed was impossible except in a small
territory or a city-state.
They solved, almost overnight, two
of the most intractable problems in
the history of government: colonialism
and federalism. No Old World nation
had known what to do with colonies
except to exploit them for the benefit
of the mother country. The new Uni¬
ted States was born the largest nation
in the Western world and was, from
the beginning and throughout the 19th
century, a great colonizing power with
a hinterland that stretched westward
to the Mississippi and, eventually, to
the Pacific.
BY the simple device of trans¬
forming "colonies" into states,
and admitting these states into the
union on the basis of absolute equa¬
lity with the original states, the Found¬
ing Fathers taught the world a lesson
which it has learned only slowly and
painfully down to our own day.
' That generation solved, too, the
problem of federalism a problem that
had baffled statesmen in the ancient
Greek confederacies, in medieval Ita¬
ly of the Lombard League, in the con¬
federations of Helvetica and of the
Low Countries, in the Holy Roman
Empire, and in the British Empire. In
little more than a decade, Americans
worked out the proper principles of
federalism and welded together a fed¬
eral union which is today the oldest
and the most successful in history.
They had declared that all govern¬
ment derives its powers from the con¬
sent of the governed a principle an-
'cient in history but never before trans
lated into practice and one which,
even today, is not generally conceded.
How were the governed to give their
"consent": how were they to "alter
or abolish" government and "insti¬
tute" new government?
Nowhere else on the globe except
perhaps in some of the Swiss cantons
had the principle of democracy been
institutionalized. The Founding Fathers
invented the constitutional convention
as the appropriate instrument for mak¬
ing, altering, abolishing, and remaking
government; that is, they legalized
revolution. And, like federalism, the
constitutional convention has spread
throughout the globe.
For the first time, too, the Americans
institutionalized the familiar principle
that government was limited. As late
as 1766 the British Parliament had pro¬
claimed the right to bind the colonies
"in all cases whatsoever", and it was
a commonplace of history that kings
and princes had the right to bind their
subjects.
But the Founding Fathers insisted
that no government had all power, and
they proceeded, then, to place on
government such checks, balances, li¬
mits, restrictions, and prohibitions as
would make sure that government could
not indeed exercise any powers but
those assigned to it by the people.
What a congeries of inventions and
devices to achieve this end: written
constitutions, the federal system, the
separation of powers, bicameral legis¬
latures, annual elections, and, to top
them all, bills of rights that were part
of fundamental law and that protected
men in their freedom of religion, of
speech, of the press, and of assembly
something not even the English Bills
of Rights attempted to do.
This principle, too that government
was limited spread into every conti¬
nent. It has not conquered the globe,
and it is competing, even now, for the
allegiance of men everywhere. But
that the area of freedom is larger to¬
day than it was in 1776 owes some¬
thing to the American demonstration
that men can make and that men can
limit government.
Thus this generation incomparably
the most creative in American history
was responsible for launching the
most important political institutions of
modern history: the constitutional con¬
vention, the written constitution, fed¬
eralism, the co-ordinate state, limited
government, substantive bills of rights,
judicial review, and even the political
party (for the parties that emerged in
the 1790s have some claim to be the
first modern parties in history). Equal¬
ly significant and equally influential
were the innovations in the realm of
social institutions.
Thus for the first time, Americans of
the Revolutionary generation not only
established complete religious tolera¬
tion but also separated church and
state with its corollary principle of
voluntarism in religion.
Thus for the first time in modern
history they formally subordinated
the military to the civilian authority.
They realized the principle that men
were "created equal" in a larger mea¬
sure than did any other Western so¬
ciety, though they failed, tragically, to
extend that principle to blacks: their
failure here was a failure not so much
of leadership as of following.
It is sobering to reflect that their
successors did not solve this prob¬
lem until almost a century later, and
then by violence, and that another
century was to elapse before Ameri¬
cans were prepared to concede even
formal equality to the black race.
IT was good fortune rather than
principle which accounted for a
greater degree of material well-being
in the early Republic than could be
found elsewhere on the globe, but it
was principle that made that good
fortune available to almost all who
were white and that kept open the
doors for the peoples of the Old
World.
And, to assure the continuation of
all this, Americans embarked upon
what we may call, for want of a better
name, the Jeffersonian programme of
the conquest of ignorance by provid¬
ing schools and colleges on a lavish
scale open to'all. Americans encour¬
aged learning and science by estab¬
lishing freedom of the press; they
were even so romantic as to write
guarantees of happiness into their
Constitution.
In all this the Founding Fathers
were animated by a sense of obliga¬
tion, and of mission, not only to the
peoples of the world but also to pos¬
terity. It was for posterity that they
fought and planned and built; it was
the needs of posterity that were cons¬
tantly uppermost in their minds. This
concern was sometimes exaggerated
as it was in Jefferson's "land
enough for our descendants to the
thousandth and ten-thousandth gen¬
eration," but it was never merely
rhetorical.
Nowhere else is the contrast bet¬
ween the Revolutionary generation
and our own non-revolutionary (or
counter-revolutionary) generation more
conspicuous than in the. passing, of
the sense of fiduciary obligation. We
give lip service to posterity, but by
plundering the natural resources of
land and water, recklessly polluting
the environment, building immense

nuclear armaments, fostering racial
and national animosities, and piling
up almost limitless debts, we systema¬
tically betray it.
The American Revolution was a
catalytic agent everywhere in the
Western world. "All Europe is on our
side," wrote Franklin with pardon¬
able exaggeration from Paris. Cer¬
tainly, all the European liberals were
on the American side even in Brit¬
ain, even in British Hanover. The war
divided British opinion as sharply as
the Vietnam War divided American,
but its opponents were more outspo
ken and more courageous than were
the opponents of the destruction of
Vietnam and Cambodia.
English philosophes like Dr. Price
and Dr.. Priestley openly championed
the American cause; statesmen like
Chatham and Shelburne, Rockingham
and Grafton, warned that Britain going
to war was folly.
The war, the American victory, and
the American example immensely sti¬
mulated popular efforts to reform the
British political system to broaden
the suffrage, end the scandal of rotten
boroughs, and encourage annual meet
ings of Parliament: all in vain, for the
almost paranoid reaction against the
French Revolution, which found classic
expression in Edmund Burke's "Re¬
flections", inaugurated something like
a reign of terror in Britain.
Elsewhere, too, the American exam¬
ple was infectious: in France, where
Jefferson helped draft the Declaration
of the Rights of Man and where Tom
Paine served in the constituent assem¬
bly; in Italy, where the fiery Alfieri
celebrated the American cause in five
odes to liberty and countless dramas;
in the Netherlands, where stout revo¬
lutionaries like van der Capellen and
van der Kemp fought again in vain
to reconstruct the aristocratic govern¬
ment of those provinces; in the Ger-
manies, where Christoph Ebeling was
certain that "America must give an
example to the world"; even in des¬
potic Denmark, where, as Henrik Stef¬
fens remembered, "all the ships flew
flags and pennants and every ship
with cannon saluted the new nation."
Nor was the influence of the Revo¬
lution confined to the Old World. The
struggle for the independence of Latin
America derived more from the French
than from the American Revolution,
but the Latin Americans knew, after
all, that the French Revolution had
ended in the despotism of a Napoleon
and the American in the birth of a free
republic, and it was the American
example they sought to emulate.
And the power of that example was
to emerge again and again on the
stage of history, even into our own
time, when both Rhodesia and North
Vietnam borrowed the language, if not
the spirit, of the Declaration of Inde¬
pendence, to justify their own revo¬
lutions.
Revolution, independence, nation-
making, new political institutions all
these set examples and standards
which excited and encouraged imita¬
tion around the globe. More impor¬
tant, however, was the impact of what
was going on in the great social and
economic laboratory of America the
spectacle not only of successful self-
government but also of economic op¬
portunity and social equality and reli¬
gious liberty and the potentialities of
private voluntary associations, all
available to ordinary men and women.
What excited Europeans in the 19th
century was what had excited the
Founding Fathers in the 18th the
chance to escape from Europe and to
create a new order of society.
. The American farmer, Hector St.
John de Crèvec saw this at the
very outset of the American experi¬
ment. The European, he said, be¬
comes an American "by being receiv-r

### America's spirit of 1776
Led in the broad lap of our great Alma
Mater. Here individuals of all nations
are melted into a new race of men,
whose labours and posterity will one
day cause great changes in the world.
Americans are the Western pilgrims
who are carrying along with them that
great mass of arts, sciences, vigour,
and industry which began long since
in the east; they will finish the great
circle."
And he added what was to be of
crucial importance in transforming the
European into the American, that
"Europe contains hardly any other
distinctions but lords and tenants;
this fair country alone is settled by
freeholders, the possessors of the soil
they cultivate, members of the govern¬
ment they obey, and framers of their
own laws... There is room for every¬
body in America... Instead of starv¬
ing he will be fed; instead of being
idle he will have employment; and
these are riches enough for such men
as come over."
What Crèvecaur described became
the stuff of Tocqueville's philosophy:
that equalityhe used the term demo¬
cracy the distinguishing fea¬
ture of American life and that it was,
if not precisely the mission, then the
destiny of America, by her example
and by her attraction, to spread
equality throughout the Old World.
In these analyses both Crèvec
and Tocqueville left out slavery (they
were to recognize and lament that
curse elsewhere in their writings), but
in their recognition that the American
Revolution meantwhat its motto pro¬
claimed a new order of the ages
(novus ordo saeclorum) socially and
morally as well as politically, they
were one with the Americans who had
carried through both revolutions.
There is an elegiac quality about all
this. We are no longer a revolutionary
people. We are no longer creative in
politics and government; every major
political institution that we have today
was invented before 1800; none has
been invented since then.
We no longer open our doors to
the poor and the oppressed of the
world. We no longer think of our
mission as primarily that of lifting the
burdens from the shoulders of men,
and when we undertake to spread
our way of life, it is through force, not
through moral example.
Perhaps a realization of what we
once stood for, what we once accom¬
plished, and what we once meant to
mankind may yet lead us back to
those paths which we were the first
to tread. Listen to Tom Paine, as he
rejoices in the triumph of "the great-

THIS is the year of the Bicenten¬

Americans celebrate their two hun¬

so, most Americans see their nation
as at a crossroads, at once strong
and innovative, yet beleaguered and
suffering.
In the tension between these oppos¬

detect the very source of America's
continuing vitality: a tension between
goals, between regions, and between
conceptions of the past and the
present.
The United States came into being
by an act of revolution, and according
to accepted American scripture, in a
single moment in time: on 4 July
1776. Most nations see themselves as
the product of evolutionary forces, and
while all have conventionally agreed
upon dates on which they" celebrate
their national holidays, very few would
profess to identify the precise moment |
in time when they became a nation.!

AMERICA'S NOBEL
LAUREATES
OF LITERATURE
A total of over 450 Nobel Prizes have been awar¬
ded since 1901 for outstanding contributions to
"the good of humanity" in physics, chemistry,
physiology and medicine, literature, peace and
(since 1969) economics. Of these awards more
than 120 have gone to laureates from the United
States. Nobel Prizes were created under the
terms of the will of Alfred Nobel (1833-1896) the
Swedish chemist, engineer and philanthropist.
Americans lead the field in physics (with 32
laureates out of 100 awards between 1901 and
1974), physiology and medicine (41 laureates out
of 112) and peace (17 laureates out of 71). On
right we present a gallery of America's 6 Nobel
Prizewinners in literature.
SINCLAIR LEWIS - 1930
First American Nobel laureate for
literature. Accomplished observer
of the American scene, Lewis used
withering satire to expose what he
saw as weaknesses in American
society. He won an international
reputation with novels such as
Main Street (1920) and Babbit (1922).
EUGENE O' NEILL - 1936
Many of this great dramatist's 45
plays reflect his sympathy for
society's failures and outcasts.
O'Neill stated that his task as a
playwright was to "dig at the
roots of the sickness of today''
and examined the predicament of
modern man in such world-famous
plays as The Iceman Cometh
(1946) and Long Day's Journey
into Night (produced in 1956).
In a sense, Americans are assert¬
ing that the United States was a
facf at the moment of its assertion,
for the two hundred years they cele¬
brate date from the Declaration of
Independence in 1776, not from either
the peace settlement of 1783 or the
formal ratification of the Constitution
in 1788.
Most nations celebrate the assump¬
tion of. nationhood in the moment of
constitution making; Americans, by
celebrating the declaration of their
independence before it was an accom¬
plished fact, continue to attest to the
vitality of the revolutionary tradition
in their history.
Americans are increasingly aware,
as well, that they are celebrating an
exceptional period of political stability.
In truth, few nations in the world are
older than the United States, in poli¬
tical terms, and while Americans may
speak of their relative youthfulness
culturally they now celebrate an
exceptional antiquity politically.
Great Britain, Switzerland, Sweden,
Denmark perhaps these may trace
their political continuity over more
than two centuries from an unchanged
constitution. But most of the nations
of the world have passed through
Third Reichs, Fourth Republics, and
Fifth Empires, while the United States
has continued to thrive under one
of the world's oldest constitutional
documents.
For this stability, Americans feel
they have much rightfully to cele¬
brate in 1776. They feel that, in gen¬
eral, nations are of three types: those
that imitate the goals of others; those
that have achieved their goals and
lack the vitality to define new ones,
so that though once dynamic they
become increasingly conservative in
their defence of the goals already
achieved; and those nations that have
defined for themselves goals so dyna¬
mic and so attractive as both to con¬
tinue to energize their citizenry and to
be the object of imitation by others.
Most Americans feel that the United
States is an example of this third type
of nation, while an increasing number
may, on this Bicentennial occasion,
be fearful that their nation is slipping
into the stance of the second type of
nation, defending the past rather
than continuing to seek out the future.
To be sure, most Americans recog¬
nize the inherent tension between the
national goals they so clearly stated
in 1776 and again in the Constitution,
and the continued effort to make those
goals real In the lives of all Americans.
Few nations have so boldly declared
their national course that all men
be guaranteed equality of opportunity
in their pursuit of life, liberty, and hap¬
piness and have so openly admitted
to the world their own shortcomings.
Yet most Americans also recognize
that in revealing their shortcomings
to the world, they also give testimony
that theirs is a truly open society.
All Americans can take pride, paradox¬
ical as it may be, in the fact that the
most anti-American information avail¬
able to the world is information pro¬
vided by America's own free press.
Some Americans also have come to
sense the making of another paradox,
as the media make known even the
minutiae of American daily life, and
feed back to the American an aware¬
ness of world feeling about the United
States. Much that we once were
inclined to see as anti-American¬
ism, we now realize is the disappoint¬
ment of those who are (or were) our
friends, who are unhappy that we have
not become that which they expected
us to be.
Those Europeans who in the nine¬
teenth century thought that the United
States had an opportunity to avoid
Leviathan, to forestall the rise of com¬
plex government, to preserve a pris¬
tine environment and to solve social
ills before they occurred, are disap¬
pointed to find that the United States
did not succeed in escaping history.
But as Americans contemplate their
two hundred years of history, many
recognize that the United States has
never had any obligation to become
what others wished it to be after
all, a nation's goals grow from its
soil, its people, and their experiences,
and they should not be borrowed from
the expectations of others.
In this sober paradox, many Am¬
ericans sense that this is a time less
for celebration than for introspection
a time to ask what has been accom¬
plished, and what remains to be done,
and how best one must move the
nation toward the goals already
so clearly, publicly, and long ago
defined.
In this mood of contemplation, many
Americans sense, too, that the United
States is experiencing a number of
profound changes. Three of these
changes are so profound as virtually
to make certain that the American five
decades hence will be a very different
person to the American of today.
The first of these changes is the
decline of the old, innovative influence
of the frontier in American life. While
Americans still enjoy a physical and
social mobility found in few if any
other societies, the mobility-factor in
their society is less significant today
than it was even two decades ago.
There is no longer a distinct fron¬
tier on which social and political
experiments are possible. That fron¬
tier helped make Americans the para¬
dox they became: aggressive, opti-

### Americans as they see the United States
PEARL S. BUCK - 1938
Awarded the Nobel Prize for her
novels and biographies. Her many
books such as The Good Earth
(1931) have been widely translated.
They show her keen understand¬
ing of China and the Chinese
people gained from living there
for many years.
f^
WILLIAM FAULKNER - 1949
Won international fame for his no¬
vels about the fictional "Yoknapa-
tawpha County", based on the area
around his home town of Oxford,
Mississippi. In many books such
as The Sound and the Fury (1929)
Faulkner explored the traditions
and history of the Deep South,
stressing "the eternal verities''
such as love, honour, pity, pride
and compassion.
ERNEST HEMINGWAY - 1954
Hemingway's crisp, colloquial style
and his stories and novels reflect¬
ing the ideals of courage, enduran¬
ce and honour had an enormous
influence on world literature. His
early novels The Sun Also Rises
(1926) and A Farewell to Arms
(1929) brought him international
recognition. His last major work was
The Old Man and the Sea (1952).
JOHN STEINBECK - 1962
Most of his novels are set in Cali¬
fornia and depict with realism and
sympathy the plight of the poor and
downtrodden. The Grapes of Wrath
(1939) about the migration of a
dispossessed family from Oklahoma
to California has been called "the
20th-century Uncle Tom's Cabin".
Among his famous novels are Ot
Mice and Men (1937), Tortilla Flat
(1935) and Cannery Row (1944).
mistic, materialistic, philanthropic,
wasteful!
(To be sure, in one sense the fron¬
tier continues to operate through the
American federal structure, for each
state can be a social laboratory,
experimenting with legislation long
before the nation as a whole need
embark on an untried legislative path.)
The second of the clearly obvious
changes is in the gradual erosion of
a faith in universal economic abund¬
ance. Once the future seemed not
only big with blessings but there
seemed genuinely to be enough for
all if one did not prosper, this failure
was laid to laziness, or perhaps bad
luck, but not to the structure of
society.
If there were not "jam today" there
would be "jam tomorrow", for Am¬
erican history lay in the future, in the
presence of natural economic abun¬
dance. Increasingly today Americans
sense that economic abundance is at
risk, and that to protect it may require
the continued intervention of the big
government most instinctively suspect
of wishing to curtail local liberties.
The tension between the need for
predictive capacity in the economy,
and thus planning, and the older
conventional wisdoms of free enter¬
prise, is a tension that all can feel.
This tension may also be healthy, pro¬
ductive of a dynamic society, provid¬
ed a balance can be struck.
The third change in American life
is the most obvious of all. Americans
once enjoyed an unprecedented na¬
tional security, free of charge. Sep¬
arated by two great oceans from most
potential enemies, the United States
did not need to put large portions of
its national income into national
defence. There were no American
Maginot Lines, standing armies, or
entangling alliances.
Between 1815, when the last British
troops left Louisiana, and 1942, when
the first Japanese troops put ashore
in the Aleutian Island chain-off Alaska,
the United States was free of extra-
continental invasion. Few nations
have enjoyed 125 years of security
that was free of cost.
The United States no longer does
so either, as defence looms large in
the national budget. The awareness
that security is not without cost, finan¬
cial and moral, is also central to this
Bicentennial year.
But if Americans are contemplative,
sober, even nostalgic for a simpler
past, they also recognize that they
need not apologize for the main sweep
of their history. Americans know that
they have made mistakes and they
recognize that their mistakes count
heavily in the world's scales, for a
country that looms so large on the
world scene can have a staggering
impact when it stumbles.
Yet most Americans, however criti¬
cal they may be of their own nation,
also believe that the world is a better
place for two hundred years of Am¬
erican history. Can anyone but the
most committed ideologue truly be¬
lieve that the world would be a freer
place today had there been no United
States for these two centuries?
As Americans look back over their
secular scripture, they have reason to
be pleased that theirs is an entrench¬
ed Bill of Rights. Many nations have
bills of rights today; virtually none are
entrenched. Recent demonstrations
that no one may successfully maintain
that they are above the law empha¬
sizes anew that this is a government
of laws not men.
The continuing flurry of primary
elections at the state level, prepara¬
tory to the national election, reminds
Americans that their government truly
rests upon the consent of the govern¬
ed. Since no one may assign that
consent to another, the right being
truly inalienable, Americans are ever
more aware that, no matter how ex¬
pensive their elective process, it is
still one that works. To fail to exer¬
cise one's consent is to commit a
form of intellectual treason against
the nation. r
Of course, Americans are puzzled
today, as they were in 1776, by the
problems of foreign policy. Some
wish the world would go away. Un¬
happily, as a nation Americans risk
sinking further into a parochial ina¬
bility to speak the language of others.
Fewer and fewer students study a
foreign language; the number of Am¬
erican students studying abroad has
been cut in half in three years; many
argue that, since the world speaks
English, one need learn no other lan¬
guage, thus missing the important if
subtle point that a culture can be
understood only in its own terms
literally, in its own language. Still, the
world will not go away and intelligent
Americans know it.
What, then, do Americans want of
the world? Once It was said that
Americans wanted to be liked. They
complain that they are tired of being
told that they must understand the
problems of country x or y, when few
they feel attempt to understand their
problems.
They are a bit weary of self-styled
experts on America who in a few
sentences reveal that they do not un¬
derstand how the federal system
works, or how American regions have
retained their identities, or even what
the Constitution says.
They would like more serious study
of American history and literature by
students and scholars abroad, so that

AMERICAN REVOLUTION IN FARMING
In 1776, 90% of Americans were work¬
ing on farms. Nowadays only 5% are
farming. But this 5% on today's in¬
dustrialized farms produce enough
food for the entire U.S. population and
millions of tons for other countries
too. (1 ) Science and technology have
revolutionized U.S. farming since this
veteran farmer and his wife began to
work the land some 50 years ago. At
that time one worker produced enough
to feed 10 persons. Today a single U.S.
farm worker supplies the food needs
of about 45 persons. (2) Scientific
methods of farming and machines such
as the giant harvester, operated here
by a relaxed and smiling girl, have
boosted production tremendously. (3-
4) Piloting his own mini gyrocopter, a
modern flying farmer takes to the air.
Within minutes he can survey the whole
of his vast expanse of crops. (5) Sitting
in his ranch house, a U.S. cattleman
uses closed-circuit TV and two-way
intercom to check on the condition of

### Two architects of independence
TWO ARCHITECTS
OF INDEPENDENCE
The photo on right is a detail of a
famous painting showing the sign¬
ing of the Declaration of Indepen¬
dence, in Independence Hall, Phila¬
delphia, in 1776. Painted by the
American artist John Trumbull, it
shows some of the most distin¬
guished figures in the American
struggle for independence. The de¬
tail now figures on five U.S. Bicen¬
tennial commemoration stamps pre¬
sented on a single sheet. Above, one
of these stamps depicting two
giants of American independence,
Thomas Jefferson (left) and Benja¬
min Frank/in. Thomas Jefferson was
chiefly responsible for the drafting
of the Declaration. A brief pen por¬
trait of his life and works is given
below and that of Franklin on p. 19.
1. Thomas Jefferson
Thomas Jefferson of Virginia, author of the
Declaration of Independence and third President
of the United States, is a remarkable example of
a man of action whose talents were also medita¬
tive and philosophical. Two modern historians
have called him "the special symbol of the Ame¬
rican Revolution" because "His was a perpetual
revolt, an eternal declaration of independence,
against the forces which sought, and seek, to
bind the spirits of men".
He was a universal man on the Renaissance
model, the immense range of his activities encom¬
passing mathematics, music (he was an accom¬
plished violinist), architecture, astronomy, meteo¬
rology, the natural sciences, linguistics (he knew
half a dozen languages and wrote vocabularies of
Indian languages) and scientific farming. All this
in addition to history, politics and education about
which he wrote with originality and insight.
Writer and political philosopher
All his life Jefferson fought with his pen against
"every tyranny over the mind of man". With his
first published work, A Summary View ot the
Rights ol British America (1774) a pamphlet
attacking British intransigence toward the Colo¬
nies, he earned a reputation for phrase-making
and polished writing.
Two years later, although only 33 years of age,
he was entrusted by the Continental Congress of
the American colonies with the task of drafting
the Declaration of Independence because of his
gifts for expressing lucidly and vividly the
thoughts of everyone.
He wrote many state papers of the first impor¬
tance, such as his Wofes on the Establishment of
a Money Unit, successfully advocating the adop¬
tion of the system of dollars and cents. His
Wofes on Virginia (1782) contain a mass of original
natural observations as well as a statement of his
beliefs and ¡deals.
The statesman
Jefferson's long life of public service as re¬
forming Virginia lawmaker, Governor of Virginia,
Congressman, U.S. Minister in France, Secretary
of State, and Vice-President was crowned by
two terms as President (1801-1809). His great
aim throughout this career was to give individual
men a wider liberty. To this end he (and James
Madison) successfully urged that a Bill of Rights
guaranteeing fundamental freedoms for every citi¬
zen be added to the Constitution.
These are the first ten amendments to the
Constitution, which guarantee freedom of religion,
freedom of speech and press, freedom of assem¬
bly, freedom from self-incrimination, trial by jury,
and other rights.
He was a major architect of American expan¬
sion to the west. In 1784 he wrote a report on
the government of the land west of the Appala-
c 5<
o-SS
Engraving of a lost portrait of Jefferson
by his friend Thaddeus Kosciuszko,
painted from life in Philadelphia in 1798.
Kosciuszko (1746-1817) was a Polish
army officer and statesman who served
with great distinction as a volunteer in
the War of Independence.

1815, his library became the nucleus of
the Library of Congress.
chian mountains which has been ranked second
only to the Declaration of Independence in his
writings. Had it been adopted as he presented
it, slavery would have been forbidden in all those
lands after 1800. But it is to be noted that
Jefferson accepted slavery in the original colonies,
and his plan for "general enlightenment" exclud¬
ed girls.
As President in 1803 he approved the purchase
from France of the Louisiana Territory. The ac¬
quisition of this vast region between the Missi¬
ssippi and the Rocky Mountains nearly doubled
the size of the United States. He initiated and
planned Meriwether Lewis and William Clark's
pioneering overland expedition (1804-1806) to the
Pacific coast and back which helped pave the
way for the settlement of the west.
Scientist, architect and inventor
Modern scholars have recognized Jefferson as
an American pioneer in many branches of science,
notably paleontology, ethnology, geography and
botany. He was President of the American Philo¬
sophical Society from 1797 to 1815 and corres¬
ponded throughout his life with an extraordinary
number of scientists and philosophers.
He was also the foremost American architect
of his time. Monticello, the mansion he built on
his Virginia estate between 1768 and 1809 contains
an array of ingenious gadgets invented by
Jefferson: an improved copying device called a
"polygraph"; a weathervane connected to a dial
on the ceiling beneath; the swivel chair; a system
of pulleys and an enclosure in the ceiling into
which he could hoist his bed after he got up; a
seven-day clock. His invention of an improved
plough won wide recognition.
Crusader for education
Jefferson's passionate commitment to intellec¬
tual freedom also stands out in his fight for
education and in the Statute of Virginia (1786)
which he drafted. The Statute forbade all reli¬
gious discrimination in Virginia and formed part
of a broad-ranging plan of reforms proposed by
Jefferson for his home state. Part of his plan
was a comprehensive system of free public edu¬
cation, but his fellow Virginians accepted only
his proposal for a university.
After retiring from the presidency In 1809
Jefferson devoted the rest of his public life to
creating the new university. He designed the
buildings and supervised their construction in
minute detail, as well as planning the courses,
recruiting the teachers and choosing the books
for the library. The University of Virginia opened
in 1825. Jefferson died on 4 July 1826the fiftieth
anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.

We hold these truths to be self-evident : that all
men are Created equal ;/that they are endowed
by their creator with certain unalienable rights ;
that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit
of happiness ; that to secure these rights, govern¬
ments are instituted among men, deriving their
just powers from the consent of the governed ;
that whenever any form of government becomes
destructive of these ends, it is the right of the
people to alter or abolish it/and to institute new
government., laying its foundation on such princi¬
ples, and organizing its powers in such form, as
to them shall seem most likely to effect their sa¬
fety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate
that governments long established should not be
changed for light and transient causes ; and, ac¬
cordingly, all experience hath shown that mankind
are more disposed to suffer while evils are suffer-
able, than to right themselves by abolishing the
forms to which they are accustomed. But when a
long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing in¬
variably the same object, evinces a design to re¬
duce them under absolute despotism, it is their
right, it is their duty, to throw off such govern¬
ment and to provide new guards for their future
security. Such has been the patient sufferance of
these colonies ; and such is now the necessity
which constrains them to alter their former sys¬

### Two architects of independence
TWO ARCHITECTS OF INDEPENDENCE (continued from page 14)

2. Benjamin Franklin
Ranking among the great men of American
history, Benjamin Franklin was gifted with many-
sided genius and sound common sense. He
concerned himself, during a long and fruitful life
(1706-1790), with such different matters as states¬
manship and soapmaking, book-printing and cab¬
bage growing, and the rise of tides and fall of
empires. As a scientist he was a pioneer in the
study of electricity; as an inventor he was un¬
equalled in America until the second half of the
19th century.

Printer, publisher and man of letters
In 1718, at the age of 12, Franklin became an
apprentice printer under his elder brother James.
At 24 he founded and edited his own newspaper,
making it one of the most successful in the
colonies. He is believed to be first editor In
America to publish a newspaper cartoon. In 1732
he launched his famous "Poor Richard's Alma-
nach" (written and published by him until 1757),
noted for its wise and witty aphorisms on the
value of thrift, hard work and the simple life.
He taught himself French, Italian, Spanish and
Latin, and helped to found the American Philo¬
sophical Society which brought scientists and
scholars together. Long after he had won world¬
wide fame, he continued to call himself with
characteristic lack of pretension "Benjamin Fran¬
klin, Printer".
Social reformer and civic leader
Franklin launched many projects for social re¬
form and for fostering a community spirit. An
' enemy of slavery he became president of the
first anti-shivery society in America and his last
public act was to sign an appeal to Congress
calling for the speedy abolition of Negro slavery.
In 1737, as Philadelphia's postmaster, he trans¬
formed and speeded up its postal services (as he
did for all the colonies when he later became
deputy postmaster general).
He set up America's first subscription library In
Philadelphia. He organized a fire department and
reformed the city police. He also helped to
found an academy that grew Into the University
of Pennsylvania. Shocked by the general lack of
concern for the sick, he raised money to build a
city hospital the first in America and to care for
the mentally ill.

Franklin was one of the first scientists to expe¬
riment with electricity, proving in 1752 that

page). He became famous for his wide-ranging
scientific achievements: inventions such as the
lightning rod and bifocal eyeglasses, the "Fran¬
klin Stove" which gave more warmth than open
fireplaces and used less fuel, methods of soil
improvement, use of oil to calm rough seas etc.
The Royal Society of London honoured his
entire scientific work by making him a member
in 1756, as did the French Académie des
Sciences 16 years later. He was eventually a
member of every learned society in Europe.
Statesman and diplomat
As a statesman, Franklin stood in the front
rank of the men who built the United States.
As a delegate to the Continental Congress he was
one of the chief drafters of the Declaration of
Independence (see painting page 14). He alone
signed all four of the key documents in the early
history of the United States: the Declaration of
Independence, the Treaty of Alliance with France,
the Treaty of Peace with Great Britain and the
Constitution of the United States.
Franklin's services as minister to France
helped greatly in winning the Revolutionary War.
He received a tremendous welcome In Paris.
The French were charmed by his wise and witty
sayings and his tact and courtesy. Crowds ran
after him in the streets and poets wrote verses
in his honour. Many historians consider him the
ablest and most successful diplomat that America
has ever sent abroad. As early as 1754 he had
proposed his "Plan of Union" to bring the
13 American colonies together in "one general
government", a plan that contained germs of
ideas later Incorporated in the U.S. Constitution.
Between 1757 and 1775 he was unofficial ambas¬
sador of the colonies to Britain and joined In
the struggle against the Stamp Act by which the
British Parliament sought to tax citizens of the
American colonies, and lie stoutly defended
American interests until the Act was repealed
in 1766.
Sage and humanist, Franklin displayed a life¬
long concern for the happiness, well-being and
dignity of mankind. "God grant", he wrote in
one of his last letters, "that not only the love of
liberty but a thorough knowledge of the rights of
;nan may pervade all the nations of the earth,
so that a philosopher may set his foot anywhere
on its surface and say 'This is my country'."

### Thomas Paine: a reappraisal of 'Common sense', the most extraordinary pamphlet of the American Revolution
THOMAS PAINE
a reappraisal of 'Common Sense',
the most extraordinary pamphlet
of the American Revolution
by Bernard Bailyn
Text copyright © Reproduction prohibited
COMMON Sense is the most
brilliant pamphlet written dur¬
ing the American Revolution, and one
of the most brilliant pamphlets ever
written in the English language. How
it could have been produced by a
bankrupt Quaker corsetmaker, a some¬
time teacher, preacher, and grocer,
and twice-dismissed excise officer
who happened to catch Benjamin
Franklin's attention in England and
who arrived in America only 14
months before Common Sense was
published is nothing one can explain
without explaining genius itself.
BERNARD BAILYN, American historian
and educator, has since 1966 been Winthrop
Professor of History at Harvard University,
where he began his teaching career almost 30
years ago. His published writings, covering a
broad range of themes in American Intellec¬
tual, social and economic history, include
The Ideological Origins of the American Revo¬
lution (1967), which won the Pulitzer and
Bancroft prizes, and Pamphlets of the Ameri¬
can Revolution, the first volume of which was
awarded the Faculty Prize of the Harvard
University Press for 1965. Other major publi¬
cations are The Origins of American Politics
(1968) and (as co-editor) The Intellectual
Migration: Europe and America, 1930-1960
(1969) and Law in American History (1972).
A fuller version of this article was presented
as a paper to the second symposium on the
American Revolution, organized by the U.S.
Library ol Congress in Washington, in 1973.
For it is a work of genius slap¬
dash as it is, rambling as it is, crude
as it is. It "burst from the press,"
Benjamin Rush wrote, "with an effect
which has rarely been produced by
types and papers in any age or coun¬
try." Its effect, Franklin said, was
"prodigious." It touched some extra¬
ordinarily sensitive nerve in American
political awareness in the confusing
period in which it appeared.
It was written by an Englishman,
not an American. Thomas Paine had
only the barest acquaintance with
American affairs when he turned an
Invitation by Franklin to write a history
of the Anglo-American controversy
into the occasion for composing a
passionate tract for American Inde¬
pendence.
Yet, not only does Common Sense
voice some of the deepest aspirations
of the American people on the eve of
the Revolution but it also evokes,
with superb vigour and with perfect
Intonation, longings and aspirations
that have remained part of American
culture to this day.
What is one to make of this extra¬
ordinary document after 200 years?
What questions, in the context of the
current understanding of the causes
and meaning of the Revolution, should
one ask of it? ¡
Not, I think, the traditional one of
whether Common Sense precipitated
the movement for independence. To
accomplish that was of course its
ostensible purpose, and so powerful
a blast, so piercing a cry so widely
heard throughout the colonies every¬
one who could read must have seen
it in one form or another could
scarcely have failed to move some
people some of the way. It undoub¬
tedly caused some of the hesitant and
vaguely conservative who had reach¬
ed no decision to think once more
about the future that might be opening
up in America.
For it appeared at what was per¬
haps the perfect moment to have a
maximum effect. It was published on
10 January 1776. Nine months before,
the first skirmishes of the Revolu¬
tionary War had been fought, and
seven months before, a bloody battle
had taken place on Breed's Hill,
across the bay from Boston, which
was the headquarters of the British
army in America, long since surround¬
ed by provincial troops.
That a war of some sort was in
progress was obvious, but it was not
obvious what the objective of the
fighting was. There was disagree¬
ment in the Continental Congress as
to what a military victory, if it came,
should be used to achieve.
A group of influential and articulate
leaders, especially those from Mas¬
sachusetts, were convinced that only
Independence from England could
properly serve American needs, and
Benjamin Franklin, recently returned
from London, had reached the same
conclusion and had found like-minded
people in Philadelphia.
But that was nor the common opi¬
nion of the Congress, and it certainly
was not the general view of the popu¬
lation at large.

### Thomas Paine: a reappraisal of 'Common sense', the most extraordinary pamphlet of the American Revolution
Not a single colony had instructed
its delegates to work for indepen¬
dence, and not a single step had
been taken by the Congress that was
incompatible with the Idea which
was still the prevailing view that
America's purpose was to force the
British Parliament to acknowledge
the liberties it claimed and to redress
the grievances that had for so long
and In so many different ways been
explained to the world.
All the most powerful unspoken
assumptions of the time indeed,
common sense ran counter to the
notion of independence.
If it is an exaggeration, it Is not
much of an exaggeration to say that
one had to be a fool or a fanatic In
early January 1776 to advocate Am¬
erican independence.
Everyone knew that England was
the most powerful nation on earth.
Anyone whose common sense out¬
weighed his enthusiasm and imagin¬
ation knew that a string of prosperous
but weak communities along the
Atlantic coast left uncontrolled and
unprotected by England would quick¬
ly be pounced on by rival European
powers whose ruling political notions
and whose institutions of government
were the opposite of what Americans
had been struggling to preserve.
The most obvious presumption of
all was that the liberties Americans
sought were British in their nature:
they had been achieved by Britain
over the centuries and had been em¬
bedded in a constitution whose won¬
derfully contrived balance between
the needs of the state and the rights
of the individual was thought through¬
out the Western world to be one, of
the finest human achievements..-
It was obvious too, of course, that
something had gone wrong recently.
It was generally agreed in the colo¬
nies that the famous balance of the
constitution, in Britain and America,
had been thrown off by a vicious
gang of ministers greedy for power,
and that their attention had been
drawn to the colonies by the mis¬
representations of certain colonial
officeholders who hoped to find an
open route to influence and fortune
in the .enlargement of Crown power
in the colonies.
But the British constitution had
been under attack before, and
although at certain junctures in the
past drastic action had been neces¬
sary to re-establish the balance, no
one of any importance had ever con¬
cluded that the constitution itself was
at fault.
No one had ever cast doubt on the
principle that liberty, as the colonists
knew it, rested on had in fact been
created bythe stable balancing of
the three essential soclo-constltutlo-
nal orders, the monarchy, the nobility,
and the people at large, each with Its
appropriate organ of government: the
Crown, the House of Lords, and the
House of Commons.
If the balance had momentarily
been thrown off, let Americans, like
Britishers in former ages, fight to
restore it: force the evildoers out, and
recover the protection of the only
system ever known to guarantee both
liberty and order.
America had flourished under that
benign system, and it was simply
common sense to try to restore its
balance. Why should one want to
destroy the most successful political
structure in the world, which had been
constructed by generations of consti¬
tutional architects, each building on
and refining the wisdom of his prede¬
cessors, simply because its present
managers were vicious or criminal?
And was it reasonable to think that
these ill-co-ordinated weak communi¬
ties along the Atlantic coast could
defeat England in war and then
construct a system of government
free of the defects that had been re¬
vealed in the almost-perfect English
system?
But Paine was certain that he knew
the answers to all these questions,
and the immediate impact that Com¬
mon Sense had was in large part
simply the result of the pamphlet's
ringing assertiveness, its shrill un¬
wavering declaration that all the right
was on the side of independence and
all the wrong on the side of loyalty
to Britain.
History favoured Paine, and so the
pamphlet became prophetic. But in
the strict context of the historical-
moment of its appearance, its asser¬
tiveness seemed to many to be more
outrageous than prophetic.
All of this is part of the remarkable
history of the pamphlet, part of the
extraordinary impact it had upon con¬
temporaries' awareness. Yet I do not
think that the question of its influence
on the developing movement toward
independence is the most useful ques¬
tion that can be asked.
For we can now depict in 'detail the
BOSTON TEA PARTY, shown here, was a protest by American colonists against
British policies on the importing of tea into America. On 16 December 1773,
colonists disguised as Indians boarded three British ships in the port of Boston,
on the Atlantic seaboard of America, and threw their cargoes of tea into the
harbour. The British retaliated with harsh laws, known as the "Intolerable Acts".
These further inflamed colonial public opinion against England and were one of
the factors, like Thomas Paine's pamphlet "Common Sense", that helped to
bring on the Revolutionary War in America. Some years earlier, in 1765, the British
government had tried through the Stamp Act to impose taxes on the colonists for
the upkeep of British troops in America, but American resistance forced the repeal
of the Act in 1766.
In the weeks when Common Sense
was being written the future even the
very immediate future was entirely
obscure. No one then could confi¬
dently say which course history would
later declare to have been the right
course to have followed.
No one then could know who would
later be seen to have been heroes
and who weaklings or villains. No
one then could know who would be
the winners and who the losers.
stages by which Congress was led to
vote for independence, and the closer
we look at the details of what happen¬
ed in Congress in early 1776 the less
important Common Sense appears to
have been. It played a role in the
background, no doubt; and many peo¬
ple, in Congress and out, had the
memory of reading it as they accepted
the final determination to move to
independence. But, as John Adams
noted, at least as many people were,
offended by the pamphlet as were per- 1

### Thomas Paine: a reappraisal of 'Common sense', the most extraordinary pamphlet of the American Revolution
suaded by it, and we shall never know
the proportions on either side with any
precision.
What strikes one more forcefully
now, at this distance in time, is
something quite different from the
question of the pamphlet's unmeasur-
able contribution to the movement
toward Independence. There Is some¬
thing extraordinary in this pamphlet
something bizarre, outsized, unique
quite aside from its strident appeal
for independence, and that quality,
which was recognized if not defined
by contemporaries and which sets it
off from the rest of the pamphlet lit¬
erature of the Revolution, helps us
understand, I believe, something
essential in the Revolution as a whole.
A more useful effort, It seems to
me, than attempting to measure its
influence on independence is to seek
to isolate this special quality.
Certainly the language is remark¬
able. For its prose alone, Common
Sense would be a notable document
unique among the pamphlets of the
American Revolution.
In the first substantive part of the
pamphlet, ostensibly an essay on the
principles of government in general
and of the English constitution in par¬
ticular, the ideas are relatively
abstract but the Imagery is concrete:
"Government, like dress, is the badge
of lost innocence; the palaces of kings
are built upon the ruins of the
bowers of paradise."
, As for the "so much boasted cons¬
titution of England," it was "noble for
the dark and slavish times in which it
was erected"; but that was not really
so remarkable, Paine said, for "when
the world was overrun with tyranny,
the least remove therefrom was a
glorious rescue."
What of the true origins of the pre¬
sent-day monarchs, so exalted by
myth and supposedly sanctified by
antiquity? In all probability. Paine
wrote, the founder of any of the mod¬
ern royal lines was "nothing better
than the principal ruffian of some
restless gang, whose savage manners
or pre-eminence of subtillty obtained
him the title of chief among the plun¬
derers; and who, by increasing in
power and extending his depredations,
overawed the quiet and defenceless
to purchase their safety by frequent
contributions."
The English monarchs? "No man
in his senses can say that their claim
under William the Conquerer is a very
honourable one. A French bastard,
landing with an armed banditti and
establishing himself king of England
against the consent of the natives, is
in plain terms a very paltry rascally
original". The fact Is that everywhere
hereditary monarchy has "laid... the
world in blood and ashes".
It Is in the third section, "Thoughts
on the Present State of American
Affairs," that Paine's language be¬
comes most effective and vivid. The
emotional level is extremely high
throughout these pages and the lyric
passages even then must have seem¬
ed prophetic:
The sun never shined on a cause of greater
worth... 'T'is not the concern of a day, a
year, or an age; posterity are virtually involv¬
ed in the contest, and will be more or less
affected even to the end of time by the pro¬
ceedings now. Now is the seed-time of con¬
tinental union, faith, and honour. The least
fracture now will be like a name engraved
with the point of a pin on the tender rind of
a young oak; the wound will enlarge with the
tree, and posterity read it in full grown
characters.
The arguments in this section, prov¬
ing the necessity for American inde¬
pendence and the colonies' capacity
to achieve it, are elaborately worked
out, and they respond to all the objec¬
tions to independence that Paine had
heard. But through all of these pages
of argumentation, the prophetic, lyric
note of the opening paragraphs conti¬
nues to be heard, and a sense of
urgency -keeps the tension high.
"Everything that is right or reason¬
able," Paine writes, "pleads for sep¬
aration. The blood of the slain, the
weeping voice of nature cries, 'tis
time to part." Now is the time to act,
he insists: "The present winter is
worth an age if rightly employed, but
if lost or neglected the whole conti¬
nent will partake of the misfortune."
The possibility of a peaceful con¬
clusion to the controversy had vanish¬
ed, "wherefore, since nothing but
blows will do, for God's sake let us
come to a final separation, and not
leave the next generation to be cutt¬
ing throats under the violated un¬
meaning names of parent and child".
And the section ends with Paine's
greatest peroration:
O ye that love mankind! Ye that dare to
oppose not only the tyranny but the tyrant,
stand forth I Every spot of the old world is
overrun with oppression. Freedom hath been
hunted round the globe. Asia and Africa have
long expelled her. Europe regards her like a
stranger, and England hath given her warning
to depart. Ol receive the fugitive, and pre¬
pare in time an asylum for mankind.
In the pamphlet literature of the
American Revolution there is nothing
comparable to this passage for sheer
emotional intensity and lyric appeal.
Its vividness must have leapt out of
the pages to readers used to greyer,
more stolid prose.
But language does not explain itself.
It is a reflection of deeper elements
qualities of mind, styles of thought, a
writer's personal culture. There is
something unique in the intellectual
idiom of the pamphlet.
Common Sense, it must be said, is
lacking in close rigour of argumenta¬
tion. Again and again Paine's logic
can be seen to be grossly deficient.
The great intellectual force of Com¬
mon Sense, however, lay not in its
close argumentation on specific points
but in its reversal of the presumptions,
that underlay the arguments, a rever-

sal that forced thoughtful readers to
consider, not so much a point here
and a conclusion there, but a wholly
new way of looking at the entire range
of problems involved.
For beneath all of the explicit argu¬
ments and conclusions against inde¬
pendence, there were underlying, un¬
spoken, even unconceptuallzed pre¬
suppositions, attitudes, and habits of
thought that made it extremely difficult
for the colonists to break with England
and find in the prospect of an inde¬
pendent future the security and free¬
dom they sought.
The special intellectual quality of
Common Sense, which goes a long
way toward explaining its impact on
contemporary readers, derives from
its reversal of these underlying pre¬
sumptions and Its shifting of the
established perspectives to the point
where the whole received paradigm
within which the Anglo-American con¬
troversy had until then proceeded
came into question.
No one set of ideas was more
deeply embedded in the British and
the British-American mind than the
notion that liberty could survive in a

contending forces was so institutio-

### Thomas Paine: a reappraisal of 'Common sense', the most extraordinary pamphlet of the American Revolution
, nalized that no one contestant could
monopolize the power of the state and
rule without effective opposition.
In its application to the Anglo-
American world this general belief
further presumed that the three main
socio-constitutional contestants for
power the monarchy, the nobility,
and the people had an equal right to
share in the struggle for power: these
were the constituent elements of the
political world.
And most fundamental of all in this
basic set of constitutional notions was
the unspoken belief, upon which
everything else rested, that complexity
in government was good in itself since
it made all the rest of the system
possible, and that, conversely, simpli¬
city and uncomplicated efficiency in
the structure of government were evil
in that they led to a monopolization of
power, which could only result in
brutal state autocracy.
PAINE challenged this whole ba¬
sic constitutional paradigm, and
although his conclusions were rejected
In America the American state and
national governments are of course
built on precisely the ideas he oppos¬
ed the bland, automatic assumption
that all of this made sense could no
longer, after the appearance of Com¬
mon Sense, be said to exist, and res¬
pect for certain points was permanent¬
ly destroyed.
The entire set of received ideas on
government, Paine wrote, was false.
Complexity was not a virtue in govern¬
ment, he said. The opposite was in
fact true: "the more simple anything
is, the less liable it is to be disordered
and the easier repaired when dis¬
ordered."
Simplicity was embedded in nature
itself, and if the British constitution

had reversed the natural order of
things, it had done so only to serve
the unnatural purposes of the nobility
and the monarchy, neither of which
had a right to share in the power of
the state.
The nobility was nothing but the
dead remains of an ancient "aristo¬
crática! tyranny" that had managed to
survive under the cover of encrusting
mythologies. The monarchical branch
was a more serious matter, and Paine
devoted pages of the pamphlet to at¬
tacking its claim to a share in the
constitution.
The "royal brute of Great Britain",
as he called George III, was no less a
ridiculous constitutional figure than
his continental equivalents. For
though by his constitutional position
he was required to know the affairs
of his realm thoroughly and to par¬
ticipate in them actively, by virtue of
his exalted social position, 'entirely
removed from everyday life ^"distin¬
guished like some new species" he
was forever barred from doing just
that.
In fact the modern kings of England
did nothing at all, Paine wrote, but
wage war and hand out gifts to their
followers, all the rest of the world's
work being handled by the commons.
Yet by virtue of the gifts the king
had at his disposal, he corrupted the
entire constitution, such as it was. The
king's only competitor for power was
the House of Commons, and this body
he was able to buy off with the re¬
wards of office and the intimidation of
authority. The whole idea of balance
in the British constitution was there¬
fore a fraud for "the will of the king is
as much the law of the land in Britain
as in France with this difference, that
instead of proceeding directly from
his mouth, it is handed to the people
under the formidable shape of an act
of Parliament."
. No one at least no one writing in
America had made so straightfor¬
ward and unqualified a case for the
virtues of republican government.
This was Paine's most important
challenge to the received wisdom of
the day, but it was only the first of a
series.
In passage after passage in Com¬
mon Sense Paine laid bare one after
another of the presuppositions of the
day which had disposed the colonists,
consciously or unconsciously, to resist
independence, and by exposing these
inner biases and holding them up to
scorn he forced people to think the
unthinkable, to ponder the supposed¬
ly self-evident, and thus to take the
first step in bringing about a radical
change.
So the question of independence
had always been thought of in filial
terms: the colonies had once been
children, dependent for their lives on
the parent state, but now they had
matured, and the question was wheth¬
er or not they were strong enough
to survive and prosper alone in a
world of warring states. This whole
notion was wrong, Paine declared.
On this, as on so many other points,
Americans had been misled by "an¬
cient prejudices and... superstition".
England's supposedly protective
nurturance of the colonies had only
been a. form of selfish economic ag¬
grandizement. The fact is, Paine
declared, that the colonies had never
needed England's protection; they
had indeed suffered from it. They
would have flourished far more if
England had Ignored them, for their
prosperity had always been based on
a commerce In the necessities of life,
and that commerce would have flour¬
ished, and would continue to flourish,
so long as "eating is the custom of
Europe."
So on the major questions Paine
performed a task more basic than
arguing points in favour of indepen¬
dence (though he did that too); he
shifted the premises of the questions
and forced thoughtful readers to come
at them from different angles of vision
and hence to open for scrutiny what
had previously been considered to be
the firm premises of the controversy.
Written in arresting prose and di¬
rected as a polemic not so much at
the conclusions that opponents of
independence had reached as at their
unspoken presumptions, and at their
sense of what was obvious and what
was not, Common Sense is a unique
pamphlet in the literature of the Revo¬
lution. But none of this reaches its
most important inner quality.
There is something in the pamphlet
that goes beyond both of these char¬
acteristics, and while it is less sus¬
ceptible to proof than the attributes I
have already discussed, it is perhaps
the most important element of all. It
relates to the social aspects of the
Revolution.
MUCH ink has been spilled
over the question of the de¬
gree to which the American Revolution
was a social revolution, and it seems
to me that certain points have now
been well established.
The American Revolution was not
the result of intolerable social or eco¬
nomic conditions. The colonies were
prosperous communities whose eco¬
nomic condition, recovering from the
dislocations that followed the Seven
Years' War, Improved during the years
when the controversy with England
rose In intensity. Nor was the Revo¬
lution deliberately undertaken to
recast the social order, to destroy the
last remnants of the ancien régime,
such as they were in America.
And there were no "dysfunctions"
building up that shaped a peculiarly
revolutionary frame of mind in the^
colonies. V

### Thomas Paine: a reappraisal of 'Common sense', the most extraordinary pamphlet of the American Revolution
^ Yet in an indirect way there was a
social component in the Revolutionary
movement, but it Is subtle and latent,
wound in, at times quite obscurely,
among other elements, and difficult to
grasp in Itself. It finds its most force¬
ful expression in the dilated prose of
Paine's Common Sense.
The dominant tone of Common
Sense is that of rage. It was written
by an enraged man not someone
who had reasoned doubts about the
English Constitution and the related
establishment in America, but some¬
one who hated them both and who
wished to strike back at them in a
savage response.
The verbal surface of the pamphlet
Is heated, and it burned into the con¬
sciousness of contemporaries because
below it was the flaming conviction,
not simply that England was corrupt
and that America should declare its
independence, but that the whole of
organized society and government
was stupid and cruel and that it sur¬
vived only because the atrocities it
systematically imposed on humanity
had been papered over with a veneer
of mythology and superstition that
numbed the mind and kept people
from rising against the evils that op¬
pressed them.
The aim of almost every other nota¬
ble pamphlet of the Revolution was to
probe difficult, urgent, and contro¬
versial questions and make appro¬
priate recommendations. The aim of
Common Sense was to tear the world
apart the world as it was known and
as it was constituted. Common Sense
has nothing of the close logic, schol¬
arship, and rational tone of the best
of the American pamphlets. It was
not meant to probe unknown realities
of a future way of life, or to convince,
or to explain; it was meant to over¬
whelm and destroy.
In this respect Common Sense bears
comparison not with the writings of
the other American pamphleteers but
with those of Jonathan Swift. For
Swift too had been a verbal killer in
an age when pamphleteering was im¬
portant to politics. But Swift's chief
weapon had been a rapier as sharp as
a razor and so pointed that it first
entered its victim unfelt. Paine's
writing has none of Swift's marvelous-
ly ironic subtlety, just as it has none
of the American pamphleteers' learn¬
ing and logic. Paine's language is
violent, slashing, angry, indignant.
This inner voice of anger and indig¬
nation had been heard before in
Georgian England, in quite special
and peculiar forms. It is found in
certain of the writings of the extreme
left-wing libertarians; and it can be
found too in the boiling denunciations
of English corruption that flowed from
the pens of such would-be prophets
as Dr. John Brown, whose sulphuric
Estimate of the Manners and Princi¬
ples of the Times created such a sen¬
sation in 1757.
But its most vivid expression is not
verbal but graphic: the paintings and
engravings of William Hogarth, whose
awareness of the world had taken
shape In the same squalor of London's
and the provinces' demimonde in
which Paine had lived and in which
he had struggled so unsuccessfully.
In Paine's pamphlet all of these
strains and sets of attitudes combine.
In subdued form something of the
same indignation and anger lurks
around the edges and under the sur¬
face of the American Revolutionary
movement. It is not the essential core
of the Revolution, but it is an impor¬
tant part of it, and one of the most
difficult aspects to depict. One
catches a sense of it in John Adams'
intense hatred of the political estab¬
lishment in Boston. It can be found
too in the denunciations of English
corruption that sprang so easily to the
lips of the New England preachers;
and it can be found in the resentment
of otherwise secure Americans faced
with the -brutal arrogance and irra¬
tional authority of Crown officials
appointed through a patronage system
utterly remote from America and In
no way reflective of the realities of
American society.
Common Sense expresses all of this
in a magnified form. The pamphlet
sparked into flame resentments that
had smouldered within the American
opposition to England for years, and
brought into a single focus the lack
of confidence in the whole European
world that Americans had vaguely felt
and the aspirations for a newer, freer,
more open world independent of
England, which had not, until then,
been freely expressed.
Common Sense did not touch off
the movement for a formal declara¬
tion of independence, and it did not
create the Revolutionary leaders' de¬
termination to build a better world,
more open to human aspirations, than
had ever been known before. But it
stimulated both; and it exposes In
unnaturally vivid dilation the anger
born of resentment, frustration, hurt,
and fear that is an impelling force
in every transforming revolution.

### Citizen Paine: the turbulent life of a fiery revolutionary who proclaimed 'my country is the world'
THE first year of the War of In¬
dependence was already draw¬
ing to its close, but confusion was
still rife within the American ranks.
Despite the efforts being made by
patriot leaders to finalize the break
with Britain, the majority in the Conti¬
nental Congress was still reluctant to
sever all ties with the mother country
by proclaiming the independence of
the united colonies.
At this point, in January 1776, a
forty-seven page pamphlet was pub¬
lished in Philadelphia and exploded
on the public like a bomb (see article
page 20).
The repercussions of Common
Sense were tremendous: a hundred
thousand copies were sold with aston¬
ishing speed, encouraging the call to
insurrection throughout the colonies.
Common Sense was initially attribut¬
ed to Benjamin Franklin, but when the
real author eventually made himself
known, his readers were amazed to
learn that this champion of American
liberation and enemy of the British
oligarchy was none other than an
Englishman who had arrived in the
New World little more than a year
earlier. His name was Thomas Paine.
Thomas Paine was born on 29 June
1737, in Thetford, a small town in
Norfolk, England, of an Anglican
mother and Quaker father. It is very
probable that his later hatred of
violence, oppression and intolerance
in all its forms sprang from his up¬
bringing in the Quaker tradition.
His parents were not rich, and at
the age of thirteen he had to learn
the family trade of corset-making.
However, at the age of twenty-four
he became an excise officer engaged
in the suppression of smuggling.
Paine's energy made him stand out
amongst his colleagues, and when .
they decided to draw the government's
attention to their wretched working
conditions, he was chosen to draft a
memorandum setting out their grie¬
vances and stating their claims.
He travelled to London, where he
lobbied members of parliament and
other influential people in the hope
of gaining their support. Allegedly be¬
cause he had taken leave without
permission, but probably because the
government was glad of an excuse to
rid itself of a nuisance, Paine was
dismissed from his post.
The dismissal of Thomas Paine
appears at first sight to be a matter
of minor significance. It may none¬
theless have been a deciding factor in
Britain's loss of her North American
colonies.
Paine had made friends in scientific
circles, and through them he was in¬
troduced to Benjamin Franklin, who
was then living in London. Franklin
recognized Paine's talents, took a lik¬
ing to him, and saw that a man of his
calibre might be of use in America.
The former excise officer, for his part,
was particularly excited at the pros¬
pect of emigrating because he had
a. - / Indépendance/ on/ le'
Triomphe de/la/ltverte/
The events of the struggle for American independence had a far-reaching impact
beyond the shores of America, even in such unexpected ways as influencing Paris
fashions of the day. This engraving, entitled "Coiffure à l'Indépendance ou
le Triomphe de la Liberté" (Independence-style Hairdo or the Triumph of Liberty)
shows a typically highly elaborate 18th century hairstyle, here designed to
illustrate a current event. The "ship-shaped" headgear worn by the elegant
Parisienne commemorates a sea battle on 17 June 1778 involving the French' frigate
"La Belle Poule" which was sailing westwards to help the Americans in their
struggle for independence.
for years dreamed of visiting the
New World.
Paine left England in October 1774,
and on his arrival in Philadelphia did
some teaching for a while in order to
subsist. Then a printing and book¬
selling firm which had recently started
up a magazine gave him the job of
editor, and as a result of his efforts
the subscription list of the Pennsyl¬
vania Magazine rose within a short
time from six hundred to fifteen hun¬
dred, with Paine's articles playing a
considerable part in this increase.
He was the first person in America
to call for the emancipation of Negro
slaves, plead for women's rights, and
deplore the ¡ll-treatment of animals.
At the same time he discussed the
growing tension between Britain and
the thirteen colonies, and was overt
in his sympathies for the American
cause, though at the same time he
entertained hopes of reconciliation.
When gunfire echoed at the Battle
of Lexington in April 1775, Paine im¬
mediately set about rallying support
from patriots who, crying out for
"liberty or death", raised the standard
of the Revolution. Paine proclaimed
himself a citizen of the world. "My
country is the world. My religion is
to do good."
Himself a republican by virtue ofr

, reaction against the despotism of
monarchy, Paine endeavoured to
extinguish the last vestiges of royalist
sentiment remaining In the hearts of
his adopted compatriots; and indeed
succeeded in doing so. When the
United States faced the problem of
which form of government it was to
adopt, republican ideas did not take
long to prevail.
It was with this very goal in view
that Paine wrote Common Sense. In
it he set forth ideas for a constitution
and outlined a clear, practical and
powerful plan for government which
was later to serve as an inspiration
for legislators in Pennsylvania and
Virginia.
Only one of his ideas failed to be
adopted, namely the emancipation of
Negroes and their inclusion in the
"social compact", for which he put
forward moral, religious and economic
arguments.
The publication of this pamphlet
resulted in great acclaim for Paine.
People took to calling him "Com¬
mon Sense", and many of them never
knew him other than by this nickname.
Overjoyed by the Declaration of
Independence, but feeling that he had
not done enough for the cause of the
Revolution the military situation was
then critical Paine suspended pub¬
lication of his magazine and enlisted
in the army. His rifle on his shoulder,
he took part in the retreat which
followed the fall of Fort Lee.
When Philadelphia also fell, and
Washington's only possible course of
action was to retreat to Valley Forge
with five thousand exhausted men who
were without supplies, Paine followed
him and shared in the army's priva¬
tions and suffering.
Thomas Paine wrote the first of his
Crises after the fall of Fort Lee, by
the flickering light of the camp fire,
to give courage to the retreating
troops. His key words were hope,
steadfastness and confidence; and
the enthusiasm engendered in the sol¬
diers by his stirring prose finally de¬
cided General Washington to stand
firm and attack the enemy at Trenton.
When Congress set up a Committee
for Foreign Affairs in April 1777, Paine
was appointed its secretary. This
appointment did not, however, pass
entirely without opposition, for his
anti-slavery views had apparently pro¬
voked concealed resentment towards
him on the part of some southern
representatives. He had been given
his appointment because of his ta¬
lents as a writer, and he carried out
his duties conscientiously and with
efficiency for nearly two years.
In 1781 Congress, badly in need of
funds, asked Paine to draw up a re¬
quest for financial aid to the French
government. Paine had been about to
found a paper of his own, but gave
up his plans in order to accompany
Col. Laurens- to Paris where he stayed
with Benjamin Franklin. The mission's
successful outcome was mainly due
to his efforts, though most of the
praise for this feat went to Laurens
rather than Paine.
The aid granted by France enabled
General Washington to continue the
campaign which finally led to Lord
Cornwallis' surrender at Yorktown,
and marked the end of the War of
Independence between America and
Britain.
Paine's attitude to the above mis¬
sion, as to many other matters, reveals
a total lack of self-interest. He had
waived the copyright of all his pam¬
phlets, even Common Sense, whose
total sales had amounted to nearly a
million copies. The only people to
profit from his writings were his
printers.
He became so poor that he was
more than once forced to draw the

VITAL STATISTICS
OF AMERICA'S LIBERTY BELLE
The Statue of Liberty is one of the I
largest statues ever made (46 metres
from the sandals to the top of the
torch). The torch itself towers 93 m.
above the base of the statue's gran¬
ite and concrete pedestal. Its head,
from base of neck to the spiked .
crown, measures 8.5 m., and is 1 5 m,
in circumference. Made of sheets of
copper over a framework of iron, the
statue weighs over 200 tons.
Liberty's torch shines through 600
panes of leaded glass (see back cover I
caption on page 3). It is illuminated
by 19 lamps with a total of 13,000
watts. An observation platform in
the crown has 25 windows and can
accommodate 30 viewers.
Two parallel stairways spiral up
from the base to the crown. Each!
.stairway has 168 steps. Visitors
climb up one staircase and descendí
by the other.
An "Eiffel Tower" clothed by Bar¬
tholdi. The "skeleton" for the statue
designed and constructed by the
French sculptor Bartholdi is the
work of the French engineer Gustave!
Eiffel, who later built Paris' famous
Eiffel Tower (1889). Liberty's frame-,
work is made of iron supported by
steel columns. Collaboration bet¬
ween sculptor and engineer pro¬
duced a work that can withstand the full force of an Atlantic gale.
Base of the statue is reached by an elevator which brings visitors
from the ground floor up through the pedestal, a distance of about
50 m. The pedestal was built with donations from the people of the
United States.

'LIBERTY' IN THE MAKING (Continued)
"Liberty Enlightening the World" was no less than 20 years
in the making. In 1865, Edouard de Laboulaye, a French histo¬
rian, proposed the idea of a monument to mark the 100th
anniversary of American independence which France and the
United States would erect in commemoration of their
alliance during the Revolutionary War. The proposal inspired
a young and already famous French sculptor, Frédéric Bar¬
tholdi (1834-1904) with the idea of creating a colossal
metallic sculptured figure, that could be transported in
sections to the U.S.A. While the Franco-American Union was
raising funds for this gift from France, Bartholdi sculpted his
statue section by section. Engravings of the time (photos 1

and the head. Parisians watched in amazement as the giantess
towered ever higher over Bartholdi's atelier (3). By April 1876
the modelling was complete but Bartholdi continued to work
on the statue (his "daughter" as he called it) until 1884.
Dismantled piece by piece, it was transported to the United
States in a French ship, packed in 210 enormous crates.
Reconstructed in New York, the Statue of Liberty was inau¬
gurated on 28 October 1886. The previous year, American
residents in Paris had presented a 9 m. high replica to France
as a token of their appreciation for the original gift. This
smaller version still stands nearthe Mirabeau Bridge in Paris,
not far from the Eiffel Tower (4) while the original, on its
island in New York harbour, greets the world's ships as they
enter the port (5).

Today, two hundred years after its

of the myth of assimilation, the United
States is still a land of many peoples,
a vast interaction of diverse and dy¬
namic cultures.
In the pueblos of the Southwest,
they dance the Mattachines and the

when the Montezuma lived in nearby
Picuris. Cross over Grant Avenue,
in San Francisco or Mott Street in
New York and the signs are likely to
be in Chinese.

There is an Irish Boston, a Polish

and a Scandinavian Minneapolis.
There are Chinatowns, Little Tokyos,
and Little Italies in many cities, and
centres of Native American life like
Taos, Four Corners and Wounded
Knee.
The names across the land, names
of rivers and lakes, towns and cities,
streets, bear witness to the pluralism
of American culture. Mississippi, Mis¬

sing of the Native American heritage.
California, Santa Fe, Chimayo, San

are eleven cities named Athens, eight
Moscows, eight Frankfurts, ten Gen¬
evas, and seven Waterloos, as well as
a Holland in Michigan, Nebraska and
Minnesota, London and Odessa in
Texas, and Stockholm in South
Dakota.
In the 19th century, an observer
wrote, "On a board in front of a stage¬
coach office in Buffalo (in the state
of New York), I once read, 'stages
start from this house for China,
Sardinia, Holland, Hamburg, Java,
Sweden, Cuba, Havre, Italy, and Penn-
Yan.'" All are the names of places
in the United States.
American cuisine too is ethnic in
its diversity. It has adopted and
adapted a wide range of International
foods into a rich culinary variety.
Markets across the land sell soul food,
knishes and gefilte fish, bean curd,
won ton, ramen, Irish stew, scrapple,
sauerkraut, pilau and couscous, and
many more foods, frozen, fresh or
tinned, from the cultures of Europe,
Africa, Asia and the Middle East.
There are dishes with foreign
names that are American in origin,
such as chop suey and chili con carne,
and there are "old world" specialities
such as pizza which, in the American
milieu, have been developed into a
complex and appetizing art. A tour of
the restaurants in various regions of
the country would literally be a culi¬
nary trip around the world.
The growth of specific crafts, skills
and even entire industries are often
associated with particular cultures.
Black peoples, slave and free, left
their imprint on agriculture, textile
design, iron and wood, musical ins¬
truments and a variety of arts. "The
contribution of Native Americans to
the techniques of crop development
and the use of fertilizer is well known.
The Chinese built the railroads and
the mines of the American West with
intense labour and ingenuity, and
were industrious and innovative
workers in restaurants and pharmacies
as well. The Irish were strongly iden¬
tified with the networks of railroads
and canals of the East; the Jews with
the garment industry and needle
trades; Slavic and other Central
European peoples with iron and steel.
Italians founded the wine industry
of California and dug the subways of
New York. The lore of labour is filled
with tales and songs of Welsh miners,
Portuguese fishermen, Polish meat-
packers, Chicano and Navajo farm¬
workers, and, as the Ballad for Am¬
ericans says, "lots more too."
The "Festival of American Folklife."
presented each summer in Washing¬
ton, D.C, is a celebration of a nation
of immigrants who brought with them
crafts and skills, music and dance,
theatre, stories, ballads, languages,
culinary customs, and ways of life.
But there is something more to the
cultural pluralism of the United States
than the fact that a great many
cultures interact in the mainstream of
American life.
The cultures have mingled and yet
remained distinct. Some have formed
large centres in urban settlements;
some are scattered in diaspora
throughout the country. Some have
been forced into ghettos by prejudice
and economic control. Some live in
small and relatively isolated enclaves

### A Living heritage of many cultures and many peoples
Two hundred years after its birth, the United States is still a land of many peoples, a vast
interaction of diverse and dynamic cultures. There is an Irish Boston, a Polish Chicago, a Slavic
Pittsburgh, a Portuguese Gloucester and a Scandinavian Minneapolis. There are Chinatowns,
Little Tokyos and Little Italies in many cities, and centres of American Indian life in many States.
But there is also an increasing mingling of races and cultures. Here, a mixed family black and
white from the southern State of North Carolina.
of dignity, pride and special ways of
life. The struggle for cultural Identity
has been a long, difficult and im¬
portant part of the nation's history.
When independence was proclaim¬
ed in 1776, this was already a land of
many peoples. It had been explored,
visited and occasionally settled by
Spanish, French, Italians, Africans,
Portuguese, Greeks, Scandinavians,
Germans and Jews.
The very first immigrants those
who today truly have the right to
call themselves Native Americans
came across from Siberia about
22000 B.C. when the Bering Strait
was dry land. They numbered about
one million when Columbus arrived
and mis-named them "Indians". They
lived in different types of economic
and social organization, were allied
in complex confederations, spoke a
number of different languages and
had a variety of cultures.
In Common Sense, Tom Paine re¬
cognized that people from many na¬
tions helped to create and build the
thirteen colonies. He wrote, "Europe
and not England, is the parent coun¬
try of America." But even he missed
the fact that on the eve of the Revo¬
lution itself, about one-fourth of Am¬
erica's people were neither British
nor European and they played an im¬
portant role in the War for Indepen¬
dence. About one million were Native
American, and some 400,000 were
Black people from Angola and other
parts of West and East Africa.
That was only the beginning. The
movement of peoples and cultures to
the United States in the period from
1850 to 1920 is probably the largest
continuous human migration in his¬
tory. The growing country faced a
challenge to create a unified nation
and a coherent culture from its poly¬
glot population. Many of the newly-
independent nations of the world are
facing a similar challenge today.
Those in power and control feared
the pluralism of America's people and
their response to this challenge gave
birth to the myth of the melting pot.
It was pressed upon the country
through great efforts in almost every
aspect of society, enforced by pro¬
paganda, coercion and prejudice.
Schools, agencies, employers, indus¬
try and the media all joined to support
and teach assimilation. Former lan¬
guages, customs and values were to
be cast aside and exchanged for a
new "American culture."
In the 1920s, a theatre spectacle
presented to Its employees by the
Ford Motor Company summed it up in
visual terms. Actors dressed as Ita¬
lians, Poles, and other immigrant
groups sang their "foreign" songs
and danced their "foreign" dances
as they entered a huge pot. They
then emerged dressed in "American
clothes" and singing The Star-Span¬
gled Banner. The message was clear.
Actually the new "pure American
culture" being taught was really a
composite of the values, customs,
habits and manners of the Anglo-
Saxon immigrant groups. The idea
that Anglo-Saxon culture was some¬
how superior took shape in the early
19th century and was gradually ex¬
panded to include Teutons and Nor¬
dics, the blond Northern Europeans.
The contributions of other ethnic
groups were either ignored, minimiz¬
ed or Anglicized. The explorer, Gio¬
vanni Caboto became John Cabot,
and the jazz music of Black Ameri¬
cans was dubbed "Dixieland" to
emphasize the regional base of its
origins and play down the African
cultural roots of those who created it.
Hierarchies of cultures were estab¬
lished and peoples were actually
classified as assimilable and unassi-
milable. Racism was thus fostered ^
and strengthened and the develop- r

ment of ethnie stereotypes was inten¬
sified.
Cultural assimilation, especially in
the schools, had devastating effects
on family life and produced serious
conflict between generations. Chil¬
dren were taught to be ashamed of
the language, customs and manners
of their parents, and they shunned
their heritage. This came to be known
as the "second generation phenom¬
enon." President Theodore Roosevelt,
himself, in 1915, proclaimed, "There
is no room in this country for hyphe¬
nated Americanism."
BUT the great feminine social
reformer, Jane Addams, when
she founded Hull House, the commu¬
nity centre in Chicago, included the
first ethnic or immigrant museum in
the country to help children achieve
an understanding of and pride in their
cultural heritage.
She argued that ignorant teachers
in the schools were damaging Am¬
erican life by rejecting the cultures
of immigrants, rather than using this
diversity to give the children a broad¬
ening perspective of the world.
Francis Lieber, the German immi¬
grant intellectual, in his book, The
Stranger in America, advocated the
maintenance of cultural identity and
the retention of foreign languages in
the schools. At the same time, he
opposed isolationist or separatist
schemes of settlement, arguing that
they split the country into cultural
atoms and that settlers who clung
together suffered from "mental stag¬
nation."
Immigrant banks were formed, mu¬
tual aid societies, national associa¬
tions, co-operative stores, foreign lan¬
guage churches and synagogues,
foreign language newspapers and
radio stations. These helped to foster
a sense of cultural identity.
Other institutions developed, some
formal, some informal, such as the
Chinese tong, the Italian padrone sys¬
tem, the Hebrew Sheltering and Immi¬
grant Aid Society, to help new immi¬
grants make the voyage, find a place
to live, locate a job and supply moral
support.
Often torn between two worlds,
members of cultural and ethnic groups
faced an inner turmoil which only now
many are beginning to perceive and
understand. Stoyan Cristowe in Half an
American, written in 1919, expressed
the classic predicament of the ethnic
American. "While I am not a whole
American, neither am I what I was
when I first landed here; that is, a
Bulgarian. Still retaining some inherit¬
ed native traits, enough to bar me...
from complete assimilation, I have
outwardly and inwardly deviated so
much from a Bulgarian that when re¬
cently visiting that country I felt like
a foreigner and was so regarded."
More recently, one of the authors
of this article, Yen Lu Wong, visited
the People's Republic of China. In
the United States she is recognized
as Chinese, but in China, no matter
what her racial and cultural origins,
and no matter the genuine friendship
and affinities that were expressed to
her, she was clearly recognized as an
American.
Black Americans, visiting Africa,
have had the same experience, disco¬
vering their roots in Africa, but their
differences as well, and the measure
of these differences is what defines
their being American.
The ethnic cultures of America are
related to but distinct from those in
the countries of their origin. Two
sections of the Smithsonian Institu¬
tion's "Festival of American' Folklife,"
"Old Ways in the New World" and
"African Diaspora" demonstrate this
clearly, for they bring groups from
correlative cultures in the United
States and abroad to perform side by
side.
The enriching tie to the foreign land
is there, but what makes them dif¬
ferent is the sharing of the American
experience. This common sharing
among diverse groups, rather than an
enforced assimilation, forms the basis
for a sense of creative unity, or cross-
cultural interaction. It is a unity in
diversity, a new and exciting meaning
to the American motto, E pluribus
unum.
Militant assertions of ethnic and
cultural identity emerged in the 1960s,
and the nation discovered that it is no
melting pot and never has been. Led
by Blacks, Chícanos and Native Am¬
ericans, this new quest for Identity
spread rapidly to others, to groups of
Asian and European origin as well.
To be an American and to express
one's individuality did not require
shedding the characteristics of one's
cultural heritage. On the contrary, it
meant being truly an expression of
one's own culture within the frame of
time, place and circumstance.
Each person becomes a living mi¬
crocosm of the interaction of culture,
class, nation and time. To achieve the
universal means to probe the parti¬
cular to its very depths and express
It fully.
Young people in the United States
are beginning to discover that they
can enrich their lives by building on
valuable cultural characteristics in
their own and other ethnic groups.
Cultural identity and pluralism are
not restrictive but are points of crea¬
tive departure, if they reject assimila¬
tion on the one hand, and the narrow
chauvinism of ethnocentricity on the
other.
S. Dillon Ripley, Head of the Smith¬
sonian Institution, has pointed out,
"There is in mankind today a fear of
the loss of identity. We fear the union
of megastates and megacorporations
which for efficiency's sake would
mold us all our thoughts as well as
our actions to a new life where
differences between groups would be
smoothed out".
History, however, seems to demons¬
trate that people, individually and col¬
lectively, resist that "smoothing out."
Enforced assimilation, with all of its
inherent contradictions of power and
class, in the long run produces mili¬
tant reactions of ethnic and cultural
identity. A more creative solution
suggests itself in a cross-cultural plu¬
ralism, based on the dynamic and
constructive interaction among clear¬
ly identifiable cultural groups.
Cultural identity is a world-wide
force. Its concerns are intensified
by rapid technological development,
urbanization, and the growth of mass
communication. These concerns are
recurrent themes in a number of
Unesco projects and programmes
dealing with cross-cultural studies,
cultural innovation, and cultural dev¬
elopment. Millions are coming to see
that the heritage of their cultures,
adapted to the modern world, are a
resource of human values out of
which to forge richer human relations
In a technological age.
CULTURAL pluralism has come
to have new potential in the
United States. The consciousness of
one's own cultural identity can help
one to learn how to discern and in¬
terpret clues from others who differ
from them. It can produce a cohe-
siveness of interaction that is far more
unifying in spirit and reality than any
coercively imposed unity. It can mean
wider horizons, new competencies in
consciousness, new skills in self-
knowledge and the accurate percep¬
tion of those with different roots and
origins.
Myths of assimilation and hierar¬
chies of cultural superiority actually
blunt and dull a nation's sensitivity
to the cultural and intellectual cur¬
rents of the world. A revolution in
cultural awareness could have impor¬
tant consequences in both domestic
social policy and in international
affairs.
At this, the beginning of its third
century, the United States could cross
a new frontier. It could come to a
more accurate knowledge of itself
and create a social whole in which
pluralism is the well-spring of the
future, the presupposition and the
pride.

THE IMPORTANCE
OF PRIVATE PHILANTHROPY
IN THE AMERICAN ARTS
Photo © Gamma, Paris
In 1966 a rich American businessman, Joseph H. Hirshhorn,
who had arrived in the United States as an immigrant child
from Latvia in 1905, presented to the American people a col¬
lection of important modern paintings and sculptures which
he had assembled over 40 years. The response to this gift was
the creation by the U.S. Congress of the Hirshhorn Museum
and Sculpture Garden in Washington D.C. This added a
major new centre to America's 2,500 museums and art
galleries that are visited by over 100 million persons annually.
The Museum, opened on 4 October 1974, forms part of the
Smithsonian Institution, a vast complex of museums and
research institutes specializing in the arts, the sciences and
history.
The Hirshhorn Museum has a permanent collection of 4,000
paintings and 2,000 sculptures reflecting the major trends in
American and European art from the mid-1 9th century to the
present day. Photos on this page show (1) the Museum
building, a remarkable example of modern monumental sculp¬
ture. It is a 25-metre-high construction in the shape of a
hollow cylinder resting on 4 massive pillars. The building has
aroused controversy in some quarters. (2) The Museum
from ground level ; some of the modern sculpture pieces can
be seen exhibited in and near the vast courtyard, 35 metres in
diameter. (3) Inside the museum, visitors are attending a
current major exhibition entitled "The Golden Door: Artist-
Immigrants of America, 1876-1976". Presenting works by 67
painters, sculptors, architects and photographers, the exhi¬
bition reveals the great contribution of immigrant artists to
American art. On opposite page are some of the works
exhibited in "The Golden Door" exhibition.
A major role in America is played by private foundations
which aid the arts and humanities and research in many
fields. America has 26,000 foundations, of which over 2,500
have assets of $ 1 million each or make total contributions
of $ 500,000 or more annually. Three of the biggest founda¬
tions, the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation
and the Duke Endowment, spend over $ 250 million annually,
with two-thirds going to education and cultural programmes.
One outstanding contribution in the arts was the $ 20 million
given by the A.W. Mellon Educational and Charitable
Trust to build and maintain the National Gallery of Art in
Washington D.C.

### The State as a patron of the arts: the National Endowment for the Arts today operates with an annual budget of USD82 million and occupies a significant place in the cultural life of America
THE STATE AS A PATRON
OF THE ARTS
created a decade ago by the U.S. Congress
the National Endowment for the Arts
today operates with an annual budget of $82 million
and occupies a significant place in the cultural life of America
by Nancy Hanks
LIFE is what goes on while
we're making other plans."
So goes an adage that's as true for
nations as it is for individuals.
When thirteen colonies declared
their independence from the distant
British crown 200 years ago, the found¬
ing fathers laid great plans indeed to
guarantee "life, liberty and the pursuit
of happiness." They achieved some
goals almost immediately, like the
establishment of a representative
government. But they deferred other
ideal aims, such as the nurturing of
the arts, which was put off for 190
years.
Many of the founding fathers had
the highest regard for the fine arts
and believed that the government
should actively encourage them. I
have always believed that the oppor¬
tunity to engage in cultural activities
was one of the things Thomas Jeffer¬
son meant by "the pursuit of hap¬
piness." But there were more press¬
ing, practical problems to solve during
the nation's infancy.
Benjamin Franklin, a clever diplo¬
mat and eminently practical scientist,
put it most simply: "All things have
their season, and with young coun¬
tries as with young men, you must
curb their fancy to strengthen their
judgment... To America, one school¬
master is worth a dozen poets, and
NANCY HANKS is Chairman of the U.S.
National Endowment for ' the Arts and
National Council on the Arts. She was
formerly Assistant to the Undersecretary
of the U.S. Department of Health, Education
and Welfare and later Special Assistant,
Special Projects Office, at the White House.
She was a member of the U.S. National
Commission for Unesco from 1970 to 1975.
the invention of a machine or the
improvement of an implement is of
more importance than a masterpiece
of Raphael."
In 1789, the year the Constitution
came into effect to "secure the Bles¬
sings of Liberty to ourselves and our
posterity", George Washington recog¬
nized the importance of the arts and
learning. He wrote that members of
Congress should use their "best
endeavors to improve the education
and manners of a people; to accele¬
rate progress of art and science: to
patronize works of genius... to cherish
institutions favorable to humanity."
Elsewhere he urged the creation of a
national university in order to foster
"a flourishing state of the arts and
sciences."
John Adams, our second President,
explained in a letter to his wife, Abi¬
gail, "I must study politics and war
that my sons may have liberty to study
mathematics and philosophy In order
to give their children a right to study
painting, poetry, music, architecture."
His priorities were sound for the
time. Physical and political security
came first on the list of Federal busi¬
ness; trade and economy came
second. The arts would just have to
wait. (If Adams' vision was noble, his
timetable was too optimistic by half.
His son, John Quincy Adams, studied
politics too and became the nation's
sixth President.)
The practical bent of the new gov¬
ernment marked a pendulum's swing
away from official support of the arts,
which had been actively encouraged
by the very first European colonizers.
In the first half of the 16th century the
Spanish built mission schools in the
present-day southwest. Modelled after
medieval cathedral schools, they
stressed music education in particular
and taught students not only how to
perform, but how to build instruments
and compose as well. Unfortunately
that tradition languished. Many feel
that the arts are still largely ignored
in public education.
The federal government's first invol¬
vement with the arts centred on
architectural plans for the capital city
of Washington, D.C. At that time,
urban planning was a respected tra¬
dition. Early New England towns, for
example, were meticulously designed
around central greens or "commons,"
open spaces jointly owned by all citi¬
zens. The new capital, built from
scratch above the marshy banks of
the Potomac, was envisioned as a
monumental city of public buildings ,
that would reflect the ideals of the
republic.
Native-born talent being scarce, the
city was designed by Pierre L'Enfant,
a gifted if temperamental French en¬
gineer who had distinguished himself
in the Continental Army. The Capito|
building was designed by William
Thornton, a physician born in the Vir¬
gin Islands and educated in Scotland.
Thornton and Etienne Hallett, a
French-born architect, were responsi¬
ble for much of the early construction,
built with European artisans and slave
labour. But the work was largely obli¬
terated when the British burned the
city during the War of 1812.
Following the Treaty of Ghent,
which ended the war in 1814, the
Capitol and the White House were
rebuilt and the first serious debates
over Federal arts patronage began.
At issue, initially, were decorations for
the Capitol. A bill was introduced to
commission "four paintings of the
principal events of the Revolution" for
the Rotunda.

### The State as a patron of the arts: the National Endowment for the Arts today operates with an annual budget of USD82 million and occupies a significant place in the cultural life of America
Government support has done much in America to make the arts more accessible to more people.
This is particularly true of the past decade, since the foundation of the U.S. National Endowment
for the Arts which stimulates and supports a wide spectrum of cultural activities.
The Arts Endowment, for instance, helps neighbourhood and ethnic groups launch cultural
community programmes and it enabled 5,000 schools to bring in professional artists to hold
workshops with students. Photo shows a group of American musicians rehearsing in New York.
Some national legislators doubted
that it was "just or proper for the
Government of the United States to
become a patron of the fine arts."
But other voices prevailed and John
Trumbull was appointed to do the
work.
A Revolutionary hero and gifted ar¬
tist in his younger years, Trumbull
may have passed his prime when he
did these canvases. Even some of his
Congressional supporters expressed
great disappointment, while original
opponents decried the waste of public
money.
Meanwhile, in 1832 a commemora¬
tive sculpture of George Washington
had been warmly debated. "Every
wise nation has paid honours to the
memory of men who have been the
saviours of their country," said one
supporter of the colossal marble por¬
trait that would cost $20,000.
"We will keep Washington's monu¬
ment in our bosoms," answered ano¬
ther. " We will not commit it to
perishable stone. " Though heroic
portraits were criticized as relics of
an era "before the lights of reason
penetrated the darkness of society,"
the motion passed. The commission
was awarded to the pre-eminent Am¬
erican sculptor of the time, Horatio
Greenough, who lived in Italy.
Conceiving his subject in a neo¬
classical pose, Greenough draped
"the father of his country" in apparel
that some called a toga, others a
bath towel. Supporters said the pose
was timeless; detractors were scan¬
dalized because Washington was
naked from the waist up.
Furor followed. As late as 1876 this
sculpture was still "the grandest and
most-criticized work of art about the
Capitol" in one visitor's eyes.
Elsewhere in the Capitol conces¬
sions were made to domestic tastes.
Columns were adorned with tobacco
leaves and corn husks instead of
Corinthian fronds. The interior was
decorated by Constantino Burmindi,
an Italian fresco painter whose ornate
work and foreign style offended
some Congressmen and native
artists alike.
To be sure, American painters in
particular lacked the training and
experience to decorate public build¬
ings in a classical style; here a steady
market existed only for portraits,
genre painting and easel art. In 1858
a committee of artists protested and
President Buchanan appointed an
Arts Commission: But it was so inef¬
fective, a critic concluded ten years
later that "since that time, art has, in
a measure, been left to take care of
itself."
Historian Lillian B. Miller says the
preoccupation with issues leading to
the Civil War eclipsed, for a time, any
further consideration of federal art
patronage. As a result, any progress
in cultural affairs was due to the
initiative of individual artists and the
support of private patrons.
In 1877 a bill was introduced to
establish a national council on art
matters. It failed. In 1891 President
Harrison designated a New York
music school as the National Conser¬
vatory of Music and Antonin Dvorak ^
became its artistic director for three*

### The State as a patron of the arts: the National Endowment for the Arts today operates with an annual budget of USD82 million and occupies a significant place in the cultural life of America
~ years. But no pUblic money was
appropriated for the institution, which
ultimately closed (though its charter
remains in effect). In 1910 a Com­
mission of Fine Arts was established
by President Taft to advise the White
House and Congress, but it limited its
attentions to the capital city.
It wasn't until the 1930s that the
federal government got involved in
the arts on a national scale-and then
it was for economic rather than cultu­
ral reasons. President Franklin Roo­
sevelt created the Works Progress
Administration (WPA) as one of many
emergency agencies initiated to deal
with that domestic crisis, the Great
Depression.
Millions were unemployed. The
WPA put many of them to work build­
ing roads, bridges, schools, libraries,
hospitals, parks and other pUblic
works projects. But WPA adminis­
trator Harry Hopkins said that artists
"have to eat too." So painters, wri­
ters, actors and musicians were also
employed in a series of innovative
pUblic projects.
P RIMARILY, the goal was to give
every able American a paying
job that would, hopefully, preserve his
or her skills through the crisis. Con­
sequently, the specific nature of the
work was of negligible importance. It
is surprising then, just how valuable
much of the work turned out to be.
Arts critics today credit New York
City's pre-eminence as an art capital
to the WPA, which paid painters to
paint whatever they chose and often
sold the canvases by the square yard
or pound to junk dealers. The artists
produced 18,000 sculptures; 108,000
easel paintings; 239,727 prints; 500,000
photographs and 2,500 murals. Among
those who survived the Depression
as practising artists under the WPA
programme were Jackson Pollock,
Willem de Kooning and Mark Rothko,
three giants of modern painting.
One of the most ambitious and suc­
cessful efforts was the Federal Wri­
ters' Project, which published the
American Guide Series of historical
Baedekers for each of the states.
Federal administrators hired both
proven professional writers and hope­
less amateurs to compile these local
histories, which were then pUblished
by commercial houses and sold to
the pUblic.
Among the young writers taking on
this herculean task were Richard
Wright, Conrad Aiken, Saul Bellow,
Ralph Ellison, John Cheever, Frank
Yerby and Kenneth Rexroth. Perhaps
because the writers' work was chan-
42
nelled in a specific, conventional
direction, the Guides escaped con­
troversy.
On the other hand, the Federal
Theater was attacked from several
sides almost as soon as it began.
First, it presented contemporary plays
that offended the moral and political
sensitivities of some Congressmen
who found them easy targets of
scathing criticism. Also, commercial
interests objected that federal sup­
port constituted an unfair subsidy of
their competition.
The fact seems to have been that
WPA theatre was daring and enter­
taining while Broadway was stale.
Critics applauded and audiences
flocked to the nonprofit productions
of Shakespeare and Gilbert & Sullivan
as well as the" Living Newspapers"
that addressed contemporary issues.
With people like arson Welles and
John Houseman inVOlved, 158 compa­
nies played to more than 25 million
people in what many hoped was the
beginning of a diverse, touring "na­
tional theater." But controversy killed
the programme.
Elsewhere, WPA-supported orches­
tras reached an audience of 150 mil­
lion through live concerts and radio.
The Index of American Design cata­
logued and preserved the history of
the decorative arts in the United
States. Professional artists of all
media taught their crafts in new
community centres.
In all, the WPA ultimately employed
8.5 million persons with 30 million
dependents. Though some of the art
was trash, an entire generation of
American creators survived the De­
pression practising their artistic skills.
As President Roosevelt said, "Bet­
ter the occasional faults of a govern­
ment that lives in a spirit of charity
than the consistent omissions of a
government frozen in the ice of its
own indifference." With the end of
the Depression, the federal program­
me was disbanded, and with it federal
support of the arts and artists. But
a precedent of sorts had been set.
In 1951 President Harry Truman
asked the old Fine Arts Commission
to study ways that government could
again help the arts on a national
scale. It reported to President
Dwight D. Eisenhower, who in 1958
signed a law establishing a National
Cultural Center for Washington.
That facility was ultimately named
The John F. Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts in honour of Eisen­
hower's m"artyred successor who paid
unprecedented attention-for a mod­
ern president-to cultural matters.
Kennedy intended to appoint a full
time cultural affairs assistant and
name a national arts council, but
with his assassination these tasks fell
to Lyndon Johnson.
To make a long story short, Presi­
dent Johnson was personally respon­
sible for convincing Congress to pass
the bill in 1965 that created the Na­
tional Endowment for the Arts and
its companion agency, the National
Endowment for the Humanities.
Before signing the law, the PreSI­
dent said, "In the long history of
man, countless empires and nations
have come and gone. Those which
created no lasting works of art are
reduced today to short footnotes in
history's catalogue. Art is a nation's
most precious heritage. For it is in
our works of art that we reveal to
ourselves, and to others, the inner
vision which guides us as a nation.
And where there is no vision, the
people perish...
"To produce true and lasting
results, our states and our municipa­
lities, our schools and our great
private foundations must join forces
with us. It is in the neighbourhoods of
each community that a nation's art is
born. In countless American towns
there live thousands of obscure and
unknown talents. What this bill really
.does is to bring active support to this
great national asset, to make fresher
the winds of art in this great land of
ours. "
The two agencies have grown
significantly in a decade. During its
first year, the Arts Endowment had a
programme budget of $2.5 million.
This year its programme budget is
$82 million. While the growth factor is
enormous, it still represents an expen­

T HE Endowment's mandate is to
stimulate and support the wid­
est possible spectrum of cultural ac­
tivities throughout the nation. Both
individual professional artists and arts
organizations apply to the Endowment
for funds. Needless to say, we receive
far more applications than we can
support with our "modest budget. So
choices must be made-but not by
federal bureaucrats or politicians.
. The artistic decisions are made by
revolving panels of professional ex­
perts in each programme area: music,
dance, theatre and the public media
of film, television and radio, literature,
museums, visual arts, and architec­
ture. (In addition to nine disciplinary
programmes, there are three inter­
disciplinary ones focusing on matters
like bloc grants to state arts agencies
and support of neighbourhood, ethnic,
and folk arts.)

UNITED STATES
OF EUROPE
ADVOCATED BY
THE FOUNDER
OF
PENNSYLVANIA
IN 1693
WILLIAM PENN (1644-1718)
William Penn, the famous English Quaker, was granted
a charter by Charles II in 1681 giving him the American
territory which later became known as Pennsylvania,
thus perpetuating Penn's name. In 1682 Penn founded
the city of Philadelphia. A noted jurist, he drew up a
"Frame of Government" for Pennsylvania. The in¬
fluence of his liberal ideas, enshrined in this document,
is noticeable even in the Constitution of the United
States. Penn also played a notable role in the history
of the Quaker movement and is also remembered for
his work to promote peace. The passage below is
taken from his Essay Towards the Present and Future
Peace of Europe, published in London in 1693.
Now if the sovereign princes of Europe... would agree to meet
by their stated deputies in a general diet, estates, or parlia¬
ment, and there establish rules of justice for sovereign
princes to observe one to another; and thus to meet yearly,
or once in two or three years at farthest, or as they shall see
cause; before which sovereign assembly should be brought
all differences depending between one sovereign and another
that cannot be made up by private embassies before the
sessions begin; and that if any of the sovereignties that
constitute these imperial states shall refuse to submit their
claim or pretensions to them, or to abide and perform the
judgment thereof, and seek their remedy by arms, or delay
their compliance beyond the time prefixed in their resolutions,
ail the other sovereignties, united as one strength, shall
compel the submission and performance of the sentence...
To be sure, Europe would quietly obtain the so much desired
and needed peace to her harassed inhabitants; no sovereignty
in Europe having the power and therefore cannot show the
will to dispute the conclusion; and, consequently, peace would
be procured and continued in Europe.

THE
UNITED STATES
VIEWED BY
A EUROPEAN
OBSERVER
IN 1832
ALEXIS DE TOCQUEVILLE (1805-1859)
A French statesman and political philosopher, he
visited the United States in 1831-1832 and on his return
to Paris published a major work, De la Démocratie en
Amérique (Democracy in America). Below we present
extracts from this classic study on the United States:
At the extreme borders of the confederated states, upon
the confines of society and the wilderness, a population of
bold adventurers have taken up their abode, who pierce the
solitudes of the American woods. As soon as the pioneer
reaches the place which is to serve him for a retreat, he fells
a few trees and builds a log house. Who would not suppose
that this poor hut is the asylum of rudeness and ignorance?
Yet no sort of comparison can be drawn between the pioneer
and the dwelling that shelters him. Everything about him is
primitive and wild, but he wears the dress and speaks the lan¬
guage of cities; he is acquainted with the past, curious about
.the future, and ready for argument about the present; he is,
in short, a highly civilized being, who consents for a time to
inhabit the backwoods, and who penetrates into the wilds of
the New World with the Bible, an axe, and some newspapers.
It is difficult to imagine the incredible rapidity with which
thought circulates in the midst of these deserts.
America is one of the countries where the precepts of
Descartes are least studied and are best applied.
To the European, a public officer represents a superior
force; to an American, he represents a right. In America, then,
it may be said that no one renders obedience to man, but to
justice and to law.
The influence of the press in America is immense. It
causes political life to circulate through all thet parts of that
vast territory. Its eye is constantly open to detect the secret
springs of political designs and to summon the leaders of all
parties in turn to the bar of public opinion. It rallies the
interests of the community round certain principles and draws
up the creed of every party. When many organs of the press
adopt the same line of conduct, their Influence in the long
run becomes irresistible, and public opinion, perpetually as¬
sailed from the same side, eventually yields to the attack.
In the United States each separate journal exercises but little
authority; but the power of the periodical press is second
only to that of the people.
Alexis de Tocqueville

WILLIAM W. DAVENPORT, U.S. writer,

Director ofReidHall, then the most important
American university centre In Paris, from
1968 to 1974. A former professor of English
and Journalism at the University of Hawaii,
he is the author ofmany books and articles on
travel, art and cultural themes. Notable
among his publications are Art Treasures in

lation, and more self laceration.
What we ought to have done long
ago was to extend the basic American
revolutionary principle that "all men
are created equal to Blacks and
other minorities, notably the Indians
whom our forefathers dispossessed.
The battle for civil rights for Blacks
continues. Its landmarks are the 1957
creation of the national Civil Rights
Commission; the 1960 U.S. Supreme
Court decision that stopped discrimi¬
nation in restaurants; the March on
Washington three years later of 250,000
citizens, white and black, demanding
civil rights and complete racial equa¬
lity: the formation in 1972 of the
"People's State of the Union", uni¬
ting twelve activist civil rights groups
from American Indians to senior
citizens.
More recently, on 6 August 1975,
the Voting Rights Act was renewed
to include more than a million Span¬
ish-speaking Americans and other
language minorities. A measure of
progress can be indicated in statistics:
in 1965 in the southern states of the
U.S.A. there were 72 elected black
legislators on the national, state and

Today there are a
There are a hundred civil rights
groups in the United States. Oldest
and most powerful is The American
Civil Liberties Union, founded in 1920
"to champion the rights of man set
forth in the Declaration of Indepen¬
dence and the Constitution". It now
has 50 affiliates in 46 states of the
Union with a membership of 250,000.
Its record of test cases fought to the
Supreme Court ranges from defending
the right of Jehovah's Witnesses not
to salute the national flag to lifting the
censorship ban on Joyce's Ulysses.
This Watchdog of civil liberties now
turns its attention to the plight of the
American Indians, the 400,000 des¬
cendants of the original settlers of
America. The expropriation of their
land, the destruction of their way of
life were vividly recounted in 1970 in
Dee Brown's Bury My Heart at Wound¬
ed Knee. This bestselling book, the
Uncle Tom's Cabin of our times,
aroused America to the existence of
one more racial injustice.
In 1973, 200 members of the Ameri¬
can Indian Movement seized the
South Dakota hamlet of Wounded
Knee to overthrow the elected tribal
government of the Sioux reservation.
Although it was an intramural struggle,
the White House sent representatives
A clarion call
for women's rights
200 years ago
Abigail Adams
At the end of March 1776, three months before the Decla¬
ration of Independence, Abigail Adams formulated a forth¬
right claim for women's rights In a letter to her husband
John Adams, one of the signatories of the Declaration and
later to become the second President of the United States.
"By the way", she wrote, "I desire you would remember
the ladies and be more generous and favourable to them
than your ancestors 1 Do not put such unlimited power Into
the hands of the husbands. Remember all men would be
tyrants If they could. If particular care and attention Is not
paid to the ladles, we are determined to foment a rebellion,
and will not hold ourselves bound by any laws In which
we have no voice or representation."
An appropriate postscript to these forceful words Is this
observation by the French writer Alexis de Tocqueville, who
visited the United States almost 150 years ago (see also
page 43) :
"If I were asked to what the singular prosperity and
growing strength of the [American people] ought mainly to
be attributed, I should reply : To the superiority of their
women".
to meet with the Sioux to discuss
compensation for the lost lands that
our ancestors expropriated and to
begin an intensive investigation of all
Indian grievances.
in the same year, one of America's
greatest actors, Marlon Brando, made
headlines by refusing to accept the
Academy Award and denouncing the
motion picture industry for "degrading
the Indian and making a mockery of
his character." Brando's efforts to
rectify the wrongs of the past enjoyed
the full support of the younger gen
eration of Americans, now called upon
to expiate "the sins of the fathers."
I wish to speak of this younger
generation, inheritors of the American
Revolution and the American pen¬
chant for self criticism, a virtue that

,Reid Hall, then the most important
American university centre in Paris.
My contacts with some 5,000 students
during this period taught me much.
Their passionate concern for justice,
peace, racial equality, and civil rights"
convinced me that the principles of
our revolution are very much alive,
that we are still a revolutionary
people.
The dominant tone of many of these
students, especially their leaders, was
that of rage. The students were enrag¬
ed, personally affronted by the social
injustice and the cruelty and stupidity
of the war in Vietnam. They protested.
They dissented. Those who condemn¬
ed them must have forgotten Thomas
Jefferson's words: "The principle of
dissent in a democracy is so precious
that everything must be done to foster
it."
It is a measure of the continuing
viability of the American Revolution
that an unpopular war could be stopp¬
ed by the disapproval of dissenting
citizens. It is another testimony to
the continuity of the revolution that an
aroused citizenry, fully informed by a
free press, could drive a president
from office for attempting to subvert
the American system of restraining
executive power through the revolu¬
tionary concept of checks and
balances.
We have the revolutionary tradition,
the indispensable freedom, the salu¬
tary habit of self criticism, the old
American belief in progress and self
improvement, above all the will to
implement the civil liberties explicit
in the Bill of Rights. America was

### Citizen Paine: the turbulent life of a fiery revolutionary who proclaimed 'my country is the world'
Citizen Paine (CONTINUED FROM PAGE 30)
attention of Congress to his penury.
"There is something peculiarly hard",
he wrote to Washington, "that the
country which ought to have been to
me a home has scarcely afforded me
an asylum."
A number of states finally recogniz¬
ed their indebtedness to this franc-
tireur who had done so much for the
Revolution, and they rewarded him for
his services. Congress followed suit
by voting him a gratuity of 3,000 dol¬
lars "In consideration of his services,
and the benefits produced thereby."
in the seclusion of his small farm¬
house in Bordentown, New Jersey,
Paine had planned to lead a peaceful
existence devoted to his scientific
hobbies (his favourite brain-child was
the model of a daringly-conceived
iron bridge). However, he decided to
revisit England, and when he set off
for Europe in the summer of 1787 he
had little inkling that fifteen years
would pass before he would return
to his "much loved America".
While in London Paine worked hard
at making facts about America known
to the English. But his real motive in
doing so was to provoke a reform of
the British Constitution and extend
the franchise. He restated his profes¬
sion of faith in his Prospects on the
Rubicon: "... above all, I defend the
cause of humanity."
When the French Revolution broke
out, Paine saw in it the influence of
its American predecessor, and he felt
that his dream of a world republic was
at last coming true.
He expounded his views in his most
important work, the Rights of Man: the
cause of the French people, he wrote,
was that of ail Europe and indeed of
the entire world. Through his travels
in France Paine made contact with the
leaders of the Revolution, and after
the flight of Louis XVi he published the
first republican manifesto.
The second part of Rights of Man
was published in 1792: it was consi¬
dered seditious, and Paine became
embroiled in legal proceedings. Pub¬
lic hatred of him was rampant, to the
extent that effigies of him were burn¬
ed: and the storm aroused by his
writings eventually led to his trial in
absentia and the verdict against him
of high treason.
Meanwhile the National Assembly in
France had conferred French citizen¬
ship on Paine, and four départements
had elected him to the Convention.
He was given a hero's welcome, and
chose to represent the Pas-de-Calais,
taking his seat amongst the moderate
group of deputies.
He was elected to sit on the com¬
mittee charged with the drafting of a
new constitution. But he also did all
he could to save the life of Louis XVI,
and courageously voted against the
death sentence passed on the "ty¬
rant", which incurred him the hatred
of the extremist followers of Robes¬
pierre in the Convention.
The Reign of Terror put an end to
Paine's high hopes of what he termed
a sovereign republic. His arrest, tra¬
ditionally blamed on Robespierre, was
in fact the result of a conspiracy
which involved the United States' Mi¬
nister in France, Gouverneur Morris,
an aristocrat and anglophile, together
with other of Paine's enemies.
First of all he was stripped of his
parliamentary immunity by a decree of
Robespierre which deprived him of his
French citizenship. Then, three days
later on 28 December 1793, it was as
a British subject that he was thrown
into prison. At the time he was about
to publish the first part of his Age of
Reason, a work in which his belief in
a Supreme Being is clearly manifest.
Paine tried in vain to plead his
American nationality, and Gouverneur
Morris, on whom he had been relying
for help, managed to prevent any in¬
tervention by the United States
government. Neither a petition signed
by American residents in Paris nor
all the efforts of Paine's own friends
met with any success.
Imprisoned at the height of the
Reign of Terror, Paine saw many rep¬
resentatives of the people go to the
guillotine, and he himself only just
avoided sharing their fate. Not until
three months after the fall of Robes¬
pierre, on 9 Thermidor (27 July 1794),
after eighteen months in prison, was
Paine released through the efforts of
Morris' successor, James Monroe, and
reinstated by the Convention as a
French citizen and deputy.
Although weak and ill from his im¬
prisonment, Paine continued to write,
and the fruits of his meditations in
prison, the second part of the Age
ot Reason, were published before
long. This contained criticism of the
Bible ; and other works developed
Paine's ideas on the French Revo¬
lution.
Ageing, saddened by circumstances
and disappointed in his hopes, Paine
finally returned to America towards
the end of 1802. He was warmly wel¬
comed by Jefferson, now President;
but his enemies, headed by Gouver¬
neur Morris, combined against him
and sought to deprive him of the right
to vote.
More persecution followed the pub¬
lication of the Age of Reason in Am¬
erica, and the various churches were
quick to malign this free-thinking infi¬
del, though Paine withstood their
attacks without giving way.
in spite of everything, the United
States remained for him the promised
land of freedom, apart from the shad¬
ow on the horizon of the "savage
practice" of the Negro slave trade,
against which he took up arms again.
He published several more pamphlets.
Paine spent his last years on his
farm in New Rochelle which had been
given to him by the state of New
York. The financial compensations
awarded him by his adopted country
enabled him to live the rest of his life
in comfort.
Thomas Paine died on the morning
of 8 June 1809 in New York, aged
seventy-two. The Quakers, who re¬
garded him as a renegade, refused
him the burial he had wished in their
cemetery, and in the end he was
buried on his farm in New Rochelle.
His remains were taken back to
England three years later, but their
final resting-place is unknown.
Even though the mortal remains of
Thomas Paine have disappeared, the
memory of this brave and compas¬
sionate man, who did so much for the
causes of freedom and the human
race, will continue to burn brightly.

### Americans as they see the United States
Americans as they see the United States
CONTINUED FROM PAGE 11
even hostile conclusions about the
United States might be rooted in solid
information. But they no longer ask
to be liked, for two hundred years of
history have surely taught this now
mature, even politically aged, nation
that one does not bank friendship
between nations as one does between
individuals.
One wit has suggested that Ameri¬
cans have left the play-pen for the
psychiatrist's couch, no longer want¬
ing to be liked so much as wanting
to be understood. Perhaps so; yet
one suspects that most Americans
would settle, two hundred years deep
into their history, for merely being
studied.
The year of the Bicentennial is a
year of reflection for many Americans.
Their political candidates, newspaper
editorials, university classrooms, and
television commentators, all are inter¬
rogating the past as a means of stak¬
ing a clear claim on the future. In a
sense America has always been a
land of beginning again, where the
myth of the eternal return has func¬
tioned with a peculiar strength. In a
sense, American history has always
been in the future.
Just as Americans carry their sense
of identity with them wherever they
go, remaining loyal to their roots
despite an oft-commented upon
wanderlust, they also question that
identity, wishing to press themselves
to do better. They are children of
pride, and they know that pride serves
them best when it is constantly chal¬
lenged, tested, and renewed.
In this era of the mass media, we
all are aware that much that passes
for truth, about America or any other
nation, is a series of images and slo¬
gans. To strike through the mask to
the substance, one must study Am¬
erica, as one must study any complex
society, and not be taken in by those
who, whether with favourable or nega¬
tive intent, offer up generalizations on
a nation they know only on the surface.
Americans remain optimistic in that
they feel it is not yet revealed to them
what they may be, that Walt Whitman
may still be their seer. They rest more
easily with their contradictions these
days, knowing that some are more
apparent than real and that many of
those that are genuine sustain the
dynamic tension of the society.
The American people are still di¬
verse, complex, a paradox; the tension
within them still manifests itself in that
dynamism; for as Whitman wrote, in
Song of Myself (for which he meant
America), "Do I contradict myself?
So I contradict myself. I am large.
I contain multitudes."
