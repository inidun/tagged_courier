Executive Board
Convenes
THE UNESCO Executive Board, meetmg for the first time sincethe Mexico City General Conference, took important decisions
during its four-day sessions at Unesco House, February 12-15. Among
these were approval for top-flight appointments to the Secretariat,
preparations for the Third Session of the General Conference, and
the establishement of priorities for the 1948 world programme of
Unesco.
A series of eight meetings was
held under the chairmanship of
Dr. E. Ronald Wa) ker (Australie).
Vice-Chairmen included Sir Sar-
vepalli Radhakrishnan (India)
and Professor Alf Sommerfelt
(Norway).
Fifteen of the eighteen mem-
bers of tie Board were present
at the sessions with three alter-
nates for members unable to at-
tend. Observers included repres-
entatives of the United Nations,
the I. L. O., the W. H. O. and the
F. A. O. Present also at the meet-
ings were Dr. Julian Huxley, Dir-
ector-General of Unesco, Mr. Wal-
ter H. C. Laves, Deputy Director-
General, and M. Jean Thomas,
Assistant Director-General.
Held in a newly-prepared con-
ference hall on the ground floor
of Unesco House, the sessions were
regularly attended by visitors,
members of the Unesco Secre-
tariat and representatives of the
French and international press in
Paris.
Early in the first meeting, Dr.
Walker keynoted the purpose of
the work ahead when he referred
to"the absolute necessity of en-
suring that the money which the
tax payers of the Member-States
contribute towards the noble pur-
pose of Unesco is anent to the
best advantage..."
Yew Secretariat
Appointments
The Executive Board approved
five important nominations to the
Unesco Secretariat. These in-
cluded the creation of a new post,
that of another Assistant Direc-
tor-General, to be fuled by Dr.
Clarence E. Beeby, Director of
Education of the government of
New Zealand and twice head of
his nation's delegation to the
Unesco General Conference. Dr.
Beebv will have special responsi-
bilities in the field of education.

Huxley Reviews
1948 Progress
In a report to the Executive
Board on February 12, Dr. Julian
Huxley, Director-General of
Unesco, reviewed the progress
made by the Organisation in the
first six weeks of the year to get
the new programme under way.
"Important measures have been
taken since the beginning of
1948,"he declared,"to give effect
to the resolutions adopted by the
Conference in Mexico."The Exe-
cutive Board then heard a state-
ment which gave details of several
activities already in progress.
Dr. Huxley referred to the ad-
vances made this year in the field
of educational scientific and cul-
tural reconstruction, deemed most
urgent of all Unesco's activities.
He also stressed the importance of
the preparatory work for the
impending organising meeting for
the creation of an International

ships ten donated by the French
government and three by the

he reported. Moreover, the gov-
ernment of New Zealand had
offered a fund of Job15, 000 for the
financing of further fellowships.
The creation of an Educational.
Scientific and Cultural'Produc-
tion Bureau is well under way,
the Director-General continued.
Such a bureau will stimulate the
publicising and dramatising of
examples of co-operation be : wean
nations and make better known
the ways of life of peoples to
their neighbors. Within this fra-
mework, a scheme is shortly to be
launched whereby twenty nations
vm be invited to participate in I
preparing a series of 48 special
documentary films.
Concluding his report, the
Director-General stressed that
though the year was but six weeks
old"I have been able to observe
very encouraging sigrs of a dy-
namic and effective activity in alII
. fields of the new programme."

National Commission
pRESIDENT TRUMAN, ad-
dressing members of the
U. S. National Commission for
Unesco in Washington, declar-
ed on February 16 that the
realisation of Unesco's pro-
gramme"will mean peace in
the world."
Convening at their fourth
meeting, the one hundred
members of the U. S. National
Commission and some 150 ob-
servers also heard addresses
by Secretary of State George
Marshall and Howland Sar-
genat, Deputy Assistant Secre-
tary of State for Public Af-
fairs. The convention was
called to study the 1943 Unesco
world programme and to take
steps to implement it within
the United States.
President Truman received
the delegates at the White
House and told them :"I sin-
cerely hope that you will con-
tinue what you have started ;
that you will work at it hard
enough so that nine-tenths of
the decisions I now have to
make will never come to this
desk. You can do that. That
will mean peace in the world."
Secretary Marshall told the
opening session of the meet-
ing that the work of Unesco
was of"tremendous impor-
tance to world peace."He ad-
ded :"My heart is in what you
are trying to do."
Dr. Milton Eisenhower, Pre-
sident of Kansas State Col

U. S. National Commission for

gates to carry the Unesco pro-
gramme to the"grass roots"
of the nation and to continue
to reach as many people as
possible."Unesco's high-level

tional Institute of the Hylean
Amazon (IIHA). The United Nar
tions, its Specialised Agencies,
and several interested interna-
tional organisations have been
invited to participate in the deli
berations of the Conference.
Unesco's activities'in connection
with this meeting stem from
resolutions passed by its General
Conference at the recent Second
Session in Mexico City. The Direc-
tor-General was instructed to take
steps to bring this Institute,
which was originally proposed by
the Government of Brazil, into
being m 1948.
None of the projects sponsored
by Unesco has attracted more
interest than this proposed cream
tion of the IIHA, for behind this
designation is a broad programme
for the study oh a huge, but very
little known area of the world.
Extending from the Andes to
the Atlantic and from the River
Orinoco to the Mountains of Boli-
via, the Hylean Amazon-the vast
wooded region of the Amazon Ri-
ver basin is some 7, 000, 000 square
kilometres in area. Except for a
few settlements mainly along
river banks, the only inhabitants
of this region are about three
hundred thousand Indians, whose
conditions of life in many cases
are extremely primitive. The
density of population of the re-
gion is one of the lowest in the
world.
Ails of institute
The purpose of the Institute
would be to encourage and con-
duct scientific studies in the re-
gion, directed towards the greater
understanding of tropical nature
and of man's relation thereto, the
practical development of the re-
gion by the Governments con-
cerned and towards the further-
ance of international co-operation
and understanding.
The project for the creation of
an international research institute
in the Hylean Amazon has been
inspired by the past history of
the region. Since the discovery of
Amazonia, it has been continu-
ously explored by scientific mis-
sions of many nationalities with
the aim of drawing up its bo-
tanical and zoological inventory,
of becoming acquainted with the
state of social development and
organisation of its native tribes,
of determining the essential cha-
racteristics of its climate and soil,
of carrying out archaelogical ex-
cavations and finally of opening
up the economic wealth and ex-
ploring the demographic possibil-
ities of its vast area.
These long and difficult tasks

Rad'hakrishnan
Pays Tribute
To Mahatma
By Prof. Sir Sarvepalli
Radlurkrishnan,
Vice Chairman of Unesco
Executiv Board
On February 13, Professor
Sir Sarve : palli Radhakrishnan,
Vice-Chairman oj Unesco's
Executive Boord was in-
vited to address a large
audience at Unesco House in
Paris on the subject of Mahat-
ttMt Gandhi, whose tragic
death shocked the world on
Friday, January 30. The
reader will find below signifi.
cattt passages from this mov-
ing extempore speech.
LADIES and Gentlemen : I amhonoured by the invitation to
speak to you en Mahatma Gandhi.
I know from the tributes that
have been received how much his
death has been deplored through-
out the world.
There are many famous men,
many important men, big in their
owt. way, big in their own space
and time, but they are small in
stature compared to Mahatma
Gandhi. His mastery over himself,
his courage and consistency of
life, his profound sincerity of
spirit, his abounding, all-embra-
cling charity and that strong
conviction that he hand. and
shared with other great ones of
history, that martyrdom of the
body is nothing compared to the
refinement of the souL All these
great qualities shew. if I may say
so. his essentiatiy religious genius :
the impact of religion on life, the
impact of the value of eternityon the shifting problems of the
world of time.
When we use the word religion,
many of us in our time are more
or less sceptical about it. But the
kind of religion Mahatma Gandhi
professed is one to which even
the most sceptical, even the most
: intellectual highbrows could pay
allegiance to. Fifteen years ago I
edited a book on Contemporary
Indian Philosophy. 6e sent me a
page. and in that page he said :
"There are people who ca ! I God
truth. I say truth is God There
are men in the world who naVE'
denied God. but there are no men
who have denied truth. I am a
believer in truth. That is God for
me.
You may always take it that
the prophets of the spirit, by
simply standing outside history,
mould history. They leave the
greatest impression on history
simply because they have this
quality of detachment from any
kind of allegiance to earthly pos-
sessions themselves. Gandhi be-
longed to that type. He had no
attraction for the material tings
of life so far as his personal life
was concerned, though he was
anxious to make the material con-
 dittons of life better for large
numbers of men.
Freedom
Freedom for him was not merely
a political fact, it was a social
reality. He was anxious that India
should be converted from social
corruption and from communal
strife, and that the people raise
themselves in their own esteem,
discover their own dignity in
their own conscience, in the
depths of their own souls.
He felt that while August 15th
was a day of triumph so far as
political problems were concerned,
it was a day of humiliation be-
cause the country was then
enslaved by petty communal pas-
sions.
He, therefore, kept away from
the celebrations of political in-
dependence and went walking in
the villages of Bengal, lonely,
barefooted, taking his sustenance
in the homes of small and
humble peasants, asking their
forgiveness and entreating them

to remove from their hearts every
trace of bitterness, resentment or
ill-wI. That is what he was
doing. His advice to the new
Governinent was that the propos-
ed division of the country should
not be accepted. Until two days
before it was actuary accepted
he was arguing against it, but
the leaders were caught in a mo-
ment of great frustration. They
were tired of communal killings
which had disgraced the country
for the past few months. They
were eager and anxious to give
some kind of relief or security to
the harassed multitudes of  the
country. So against their better
judgment, against the advice of
Gandtu. they accepted the parti-
tion of the country.
."... or I die."
I met him early in December,
and when I was discussing the
political situation with him, he
said :"Either I heal the differen-
ces or I dire in the proc') ss :' He
died in the process.
He was not able to achieve that
communal peace and unity. He
fought for a free and united
India. Free, in the political sense
of the term. India is. but united
she is not. That social freedom,
that communal amity, he has not
been able to achieve.
And yet if there is any message
that he has left behind, it is the
message that we can cure these
ills only by the methods of peace
and reconciliation. If communal
peace is to be established in India,
the only thing that is open to us
is to adapt his methods : that is,
to refrain from anger, to refrain
from any kind of intemperance of
thought, word or deed, and not to
indulge in any expressions of vio-
lence or any kind of hatred
knowmg that it is likely to accen-
tuate animosity. That is the only
way in which we can build up a
true memorial for him.
Whatever we may think abüu.
Gandhi's part in the liberation of
India, his essential object was not
so much the liberation of India as
the liberation of the world. He
was trying to use India as an
experiment by which he would be
able to suggest to the world other
ways by which differences could
be adjusted and settled.
There are people who tell us :
non-violence is the dream of the
wise, violence is the history of
man, We know the results which

such battles have achieved. But
there is another battle steadily
going on in the hearts of men : a
battle for human decency, for
human dignity, for the removal
of physical strife which constricts
human life, for preparing the
world for a condition of warless-
ness. That is the battle which is
going on, and so far as that battle
is concerned there has not been
a greater tighter than Gandhi
himself.
He tells us again and again :
"Take care of the darkness in
your soul, of the savage intole-
rance, of misunderstanding, of
fear, suspicion, resentment and
all such factors which are the
breeding ground of wars, and if
you have to battle for a world
that is to be free from wars, you
must expose the darkness which
is there entrenched in your soul.
You must try to bring some light
to bear upon it and make people
believe that the world is one in
its deepest roots and in its highest
aspirations.
Unity of Peoples
Until we are able to liberate
ourselves from this feeling of
resentment and selfishness it wily
not be possible for us to establish
a world on the lines of peace,
human sanctity and generosity. It
is one thing to bring about chan-
ges in the social architecture of
the world. We can go abou
establishing world organisations,
but no world organisation can
thrive unless that spirit is there :
that spirit, that love is stranger
than hate ; that understanding is
much better than lack of under-
standing ; and if Gar. dhi stood our
for any ideal, it was for this ideal
of developing unity of religion,
unity of peoples, unity of cul-
tural thought, and for preparing
the world for a world culture, a
world conscience. This world
conscience is the spiritual coun-
terpart of the material world
community. These world organi-
sations cannot be established
unless the spirit for which Gan-
dhi stood is t. here to inspire
them.
He has met with the fate
which awaits all those who are
ahead of their time ; the victim
of misunderstanding, reaction,
hatred and violent death."A

nouncement of his appointment

Considering the programme for

not."The whole cosmic process is
a perpetual struggle between
reason and unreason, between love
and hate, between light and dark-
ness, and those who fought for
light, for love, for reason, have
to meet with their opposites of
darkness, of hate, of unreason,
and they have sometimes, more
often when they are sincere, suc-
cumbed to these forces.
We made Socra drink death.
we nailed Jesus to the cross, we
sighted the faggots which burned
the martyrs, and Gandhi has not
escaped that fate. And yet his life
has a kind of classical comple-
teness about it.
Here he was, laying down his
life, facmg unreason, hatred.
anger, dissension, and at the last
moment with the name of God
on his lips, and w ! th love and
forgiveness in his heart. Thus as
he crumpled down, with blood
streaming from his lips, he lifted
up both his hands and greeted
the murderer who was there
facing him. You cannot conceive
of a death more noble, less
hateful than that.
Here was Gandhi, who pre-
sented to this unbelieving world
everything good that human na-
ture is capable of, the very
highest ideals which we can pos-
sibly possess. He belongs to a type
that redeems the whole human
race, which invests it with super-
human glory.
His body is 5 reduced to ashes,
which are scattered on the

that the most urgent activities
should be the subject of"intensive
prosecution during 1948,"awhile
the remainder should be the sub-
ject of"limited preparatory work,
looking towards a more intensive
prosecution after 1948."
On the question of a fourth.
"Pilot Project"in Fundamental
Education, the Board agreed that
it would be initiated this year if
Unesco were invited by the Per-
uvian government. It had been
tentatively considered that such
a project might be developed
among the Indians in the region
of Cuzco, ancient capital of the
Incas.
Third Session of the General
Conference
Important also during the Exe-
cutive Board discussions was the
subject of the Third Session of
the General Conference, to be
held in Beirut, the Lebanon, next
October.
Presenting a report on condi-
tions and material facilities avail-
able in that city, offered by the
Lebanese government as site for
the Third Session, Dr. Huxley
spoke highly of the efforts being
made there to prepare adequate
arrangements for such an inter-
national conference.
The Lebanese government ; he
declared, was constructing twosarge halls for the conference ses-
sions. Ample hotel accommodar
tion would be available for dele-
gates and Secretariat Members.
Dr. Hux ! ey adc that the local
authorities were most anxious that
the conference should take place
in Beirut, and that it should be
a success. Distinguished foreign
residents in the Lebanon, he con-
cluded, had emphasized the poli
tical importance of holding the
conference there"as it would give
Unesco an opportunity to make
a very concrete contribution
towards international understan-
ding."
The Executive Board decided
that the Third Session of the
General Conference was tentati-
vely scheduled to open on October
14, 1948 and, was to last about
three weeks and a half.
The Board also considered prob-
lems of administration, of finance
and of Unesco's external relations
during its four-day meetings.
Special sub-committees of the
Executive Board had met for sev-
eral days prior to the plenary ses-
sions. These groups considered

emmental organisations, a ten-
tative agenda, for the Third Sea-

### 73691: Save the children! Says report to UNESCO on educational problems of child war victims

SAVE THE CHILDREN !
Says Report To Unesco on Educational
Problems of Child War Victims
THIS IS A WORLD TRAGEDY
ONE OF the tasks assigned tothe Secretari {J.. t of Unesco in
'1947 was a study of the effects of
the late war on children.
As a preliminary measure to
this study, Dr. Simone Marcus, a
Frenchwoman with a distl7lguish-
end record for work amonst child
war-utcttms, was invited by the
Secretariat to prepare an in-
terim report.
On the basis oaf this report the
Second Session of the General
Conference voted to izstruct the
Secretariat to continue its work
Ott war-handicapped children,
stressing the importance of spe-
cial emphasis on the educational
roblems of these children.
The Director-General was ins-
tructed to"draw up a ! plan of
study and action on the educatio-
nal problems of war-handicapped
children, in collaboration with the
rational and international orga-
tt ! Sd : o ? : s co ? tcerKe< !'' ttTtt !"tonisati ns ncerned"and"to
obtain from experts in different
counties information and fac-
tual reports, and to institute a
field surve1J of the most sign-
! ìcant experiments made in that
yteM."
Therefore, new educational
survey will be undertaken this
year on this problem and it is
hoped that a complete report will
be ready for submission to the
Third Session of the General
Conference in Beirut.
The interim survey, reported
below, thus constitueS the first
step in the study of a situation
which will probably require at-
tentzon for many years to come.
It M useful because it shows the
urgency of the problem and the
role that Unesco can p ! ay, cs-
rpe. ciaZly in the field of education.
Quoting the statement of
Lard Horder :"Let us take care
of the children, for they are al]
tha. t we have for to-morrow",
Dr. Marcus points out that
amongst the 20, 000, 000 people
who lost their lives during thE
Second World War, 3, 000, 00 ('
were children (more than a mil-
hon children perished in Poland
alone), and that the children
who survived had, in countless
cases, been orphaned and had
their health permanently affect-
ed. After a survey of the purely
physical harm done by the war,
Dr. Marcus discusses the psycho-
logical effects, starting with the
dislocation or destruction of fa-
mily life, and the social changes
brought about by war.
In the meanwhile, juvenile
delinquency has increased to an
alarming extent. Dr. Marcus is
careful to point out that this de-
linquency shows itself in two
forms-one the ordinary variety,
which she-'eels is more of a
concern for the psychiatrist than
. for the social worker, and the
other, of a different sort, which
is much more common at pre-
sent and which springs from a
abate of insecurity to be attribut-
ed to the conditions of the times.
Under enemy occupation that in-
security was part of a state of
affairs in which it became the
duty of the individual to do
what he could to set at nought
whatever laws were imposed by
the occupant.
Educatin Disrupted
The physical and psychological
difficulties outlined above, to-
gether with the damage done byi
invasion and occupation of the
war devastated countries of Eu-
rope and Asia, have had as one
oj their results, the complete dis-
location, if not destruction of
the educational system of the
countries concerned. The effects
of this, in turn, on the general
behavior and future prospects
"oaf the children concerned can be'easily imagined. At the best,
Yet despite all this, there has
been a real hunger for learning
made manifest by the older stu-
dents, at least, young men and
women who during the war
yearns ran great risks and work-
ed with unbounded energy to try
and make up for what they
knew that they were missing as
the result of war and occupa-
tion.
With this note of encourage-
ment, Dr. Marcus turns in her
report from the ham done by
war to a description of the ef-
forts which are being made by
devoted people throughout the
world to alleviate that harm.
Two mternational consultative
enterprises described by Dr. Mar-
cus are the International Study
Weeks at Zurich and the ad-
vanced course in medicine and
teaching at Lausanne ; the In-
ternational Weeks at Zurich
have been able to help in France,
Poland. Austria and Greece with
gifts of books, etc., and in addi-
tion have held meetings in Ger-
many and Italy, the former hav-
ing taken place at Heidelberg.
In stressing the need for the
greatest possible help for chil-
dren, Dr. Marcus makes the
point that the help almost im-
mediately begins to give results,
as soon as it is forthcoming, so
elastic are the recuperative
powers, both mental and physic-
al, of children.
"C hildren's Villages"
Chapter III of this report deals
with the effect of the war on
schools and education, and the
measures taken to deal with the
shortage of trained personnel,
books and equipment and acco-
modation, as well as the educa-
tion of orphan and homeless
children. Among the most in-
teresting development in this
field which are described by Dr.
Marcus are the children's vil-
lages set up in France, Switzer-
land, Poland, Hungary and else-
where ; of these, perhaps the
Pestalozzi Village in Canton Ap-
penzell, in Switzerland, is the
most striking example, grouping
as it does some three hundred
children of ten or more nation-
alities-all refugee orphans.
Efforts of War-Hit Nations
Hungary, with 200, 000 orphans
is beginning to 'eal with the
problem which they present in
the same way, and in Yugoslavia
villages are being constructed for
88, 000 orphans ; the work of this
sort which has been done in
Italy since the end of the war
has attracted great attention all
over the world.
Dr. Marcus, in her report, re-
cords that this idea is not a
novel one, instancing the"Chil-
dren's Republics"created in Pa-
lestine by the Zionist organisa-
tions for Jewish orphans arriv-
ing from Europe, the home for
Basque children at Carshalton in
Surrey and the famous experi-
ment of Father Flanagan in the
United States ; all these ventures,
shoe comments have served to
show the efficacy of the idea
which, however, is not to be re-
garded as a"cure all."
As stated above, Dr. Marcus'
report is only the first step. This
year Unesco will extend its work
on war-handicapped children by
stressing the educational prob-
lems that must be met to aid
these unfortunate children.

### 73692: A War-devastated country: Hungarian delegate views nation's role in UNESCO

Á AR-DEYASTATED COUIVTRY
Hungarian Delegate Views
Nation's Role in Unesco
By
FOR HUNGARY, participation- *-in the work of Unesco does
not mean quite the same thing as
it does for most other countries.
For it is not merely a matter
of renewing cultural and scientific
contacts interrupted by the war.
It is not simply a matter of
bindmg up, with Unesco's aId, he,
smartmg war wounds, so that she
can resume her,. traditional place
among the civilised nations."
No. For Hungary, the war was
not just a break in continuity, an
unhappy interlude or now for-
gotten nightmare, but the com-
plete transformation of her social
structure and of the elements of
her cultural life-a transforma-
tion for which her best thinkers
and poets had prepared the way.
When the war ended, Hungary
found her agricultural and in-
dustrial population eager for
knowledge, but without teachers,
schools or methods. Added to
this was the tragic
and imperious ne-
cessity of carry-
ing out, quickly
and effectively, a
big programme of
social, economic ana cultural re-
form.
Revolutionary means had to be
called upon, since cultural dev-
elopment was the condition of
public safety. Before the war
Budapest had a people's college.
the Gyorffy College, where young
peasants found, besides their un-
iversity studies, lodging, extratui.
tion and teaching in languages.
At the liberation this College be-
came a prototype, and later the
headquarters of a vast movement
of people's colleges, which after
only 3 years now numbers more
than 130 institutions and almost
18, 000 pupils.
Coupled with this amazing ef-
fort, are the projects of the Min-
istry of Education, which form
part of the"Three Year Plan."
This Plan aims, in spite of losses
and destruction, at giving the
Hungarian nation a higher stan-
dard of living and a fuller cul-
ture than in 1938.
Energetic steps are being taken
to increase the number of schools
of all grades, to swell the ranks
of the teachers and improve their
social standing, to standardise
teaching methods, develop adult

education, organist leisure, ex-
pand libraries, salvage works of
art and build playgrounds.
It will readily be seen that.
under these difficult conditions
Hungary's membership in Unesco
has nothing"idyllic"about it.
A country like Hungary, in the
process of reconstruction. cannot
look upon internationalism as
an end in itself.
Hungary, then, looks for three
things from Unesco :
I.-The possibility of breaking
away from a certain scientific,
cultural and educational isolation
and of maintaining fruitful rela-
tions in these fields with all
Member States, in accordance
with the most ancient traditions
of our country.
n.-An indirect means of mak-
ing contact with the United Na-
tions, of which she is not yet a

creasingly backed buy experience,

strengthen the
comity of na-
tions.
III.-Certain forms of material
assistance. for which Hungary
has urgent need, although she is
aware of the limited resources
available to. the Organisation.
In return, Hungary brings to
Unesco the support of her thou-
sand-year-old civilisation, which
in the three realms of educa-
tion, science and culture, and
despite the small size of her ter-
ritory and the barrier of her
language, has made note-
worthy contributions to world ci-
vilisation.
She also brings her new ex-
periments. bold and often im-
provised (all the more surprising
in a people crushed by the feel-
ing of fatalism and now victim
of a"heroic defeat"complex), but
which, outside controversial fields,
can open new paths to Unesco
and add a certain philosophy of
men and things almost unrepre-
sented within the Organisation.
The liberation of Hungary not
only drove out the Nazis, but by
overcoming the sense of an in-
escapable doom, has taken on uni-
versal significance, since it leads
towards the liberation of all
mankind.

### 73693: The Book of needs

"THE BOZO/ OF NEEDY"
"HE BOOK of Needs is- *-Unesco's first account of
post-war educational and cultu-
ral losses and needs. It is a
bird's-eye-view of the preset cri-
tical situation of education, scion-
ce and culture in fifteen war-
devastated countries."
With these words Dr. Julian
Huxley, Director-General of
Unesco, begins his foreword to
this book published by the Orga-
nisation at the end of last year.
Dr. Huxley goes on to say :
"There is much repetition in
this report. The same story is
told agam and again with only
some variety in the differed :
settings. The tragedy presented
is indeed the tragedy of repeti-
tion : in every country there are
ruins. lack of equipment, over-
worked teachers, white faced
children.
"It is perhaps through the fUll
realisation of this repetition tha
the enormous extent of the harm
done by the invader can best be
appreciated and the immensity
of the problems which still con-
front the world."
But the Book of Needs is I10t
only a survey of the widespread
destruction of material resources
in school buildings and scho :) !
equipment. In preparing this re-
port it was felt that additional
data concerning the ravages to
the health standards of children
and adults, as a direct result of
the war, were worthy of inclu-
sion.
As Br. Huxley says in his
foreword :
"I hope that this first attempt
to set forth a picture of losses.
achievement and needs in coun-
tries still lying in the shadow of
the rum of war will reach a
wide public. The reconstruction
of educational, scientific and
cultural life in these war-devas-
tated countries makes a world-
wide call for help which cannot
be ignored by anyone who cares
for the preservation of real va-
lues in tomorrow's generations."
The majority of the schools
throughout the country are ei-
ther totally destroyed or only the
shells of the buildings remain.
The loss of equipment is almos :
total. The report declares :
"There is no reliable evidence
that there is any village school
completely undamaged, with fur-
niture intact and adequate equip
ment."
In Greece, for example, the
report states that the country.
always poor, is now practicallv
destitute :
In the case of Poland, six mil-
lion citizens perished and the
whole country was devastated.
500, 000 children lost both their
parents. 3, 000, 000 children are
undernourished ; two-thirds of all
books in libraries were destroyed
and sixty per cent of the coun-
try's educational structure was
wiped out.
The same tragic pattern of
misery and want is repeated
throughout the war-ravaged
countries of Europe and the Far
East.
The situation is not, however,
one of unrelieved gloom. The
fifteen countries whose problems
are discussed in the Book of
Needs have not been idle ; nor
are they passively waiting for
foreign help. Governments and
national volun : ary organis : 1. tionß
are exerting evel'Y possILlp effort
towards the reconstruction and
rehabilitation of Lheir own coun-
tries. But wiLhout outside hlp
they'cannot hope to accomp : ish
all that still remains to be done.
The book closes on a note of
urgency, with the following
words :
"Much has been done, much is
being done to help the war-
devastated countries in their im-
mense task of educational, scien-
tific and cultural reconstruction.
Much remains to be done. It is
now two yea. rs since the war
ended, but so great was the
havoc wrought by the most ter-
rible war in history that no
country can yet be said to be
within sight of real and totf'. 1
rehabilitation."

### 73696: UNESCO and national cooperation


Unesco and
National

C ation
c-opera
OE OF the highlights of the
recent Mexico Conference
was the importance attached to
the réle of the National Commis-
sions. As Dr. Milton Eisefchower,
chairman of the commitlee
dealing with this question, de-
clared with vigour: “Unesco is @
people’s agency” or, better still,
a “people’s movement” In this
sense it is strictly dependent on
the effective support that the
peoples of its various Member
States can give il.

The Mexico Conference was
unanimous in urging that Na-
tional Commissions be rapidly
created in those States where
they do not as yet exist, and that
the greatest possible assistance be
given to National Commissions
already in existence, especially
through the publication of infor-
mation concerning the work and
achievements of Member States.

The Unesco Courier is therefore
presenting on this page, sum-
maries of a few of the many
reports submitted recently by the
National Commissions to Unesco
and the General Conference on
the , work of their
Co-operating Bodies.

We regret ,that space permits
the reporting only of a very small
number of these highly interesting
documents—all of which show
the live interest that the Govern-
ments and peoples are taking in
the work of this Organisation,

Several of these Commissions
have only recently begun to
function, Others have already
gained considerable experience in
positive action. However, the
speed of development and the in-
ternal organisation of each of the
National Commissions is a ques-
tion that depends in large mea-
sure on its cultural tradition. Na-
tional Commissions are in fact
only the reflection of the na-
tional heritage of the individual
country. :

For example, the Unesco Na-
tional Co-operating Body in the
United Kingdom, which has al-
ready achieved important resulls
in its work, is based on a con-
ception which distinguishes it
from all other now existing Com-
missions. No central National
Commission exists in Great Bri-
tain, but instead nine specialised,
independent bodies each dealing
with ome of Unesco’s prineipal
fields of inlerest. This system
reflects the spirit of indepenrence
and the decentralisation which is
at the base of all British cultural
life. It would be absurd, and
indeed harmful to seek to deny
this true diversity of cultural
tradition which is the solid core 
around which Unesco must build.

"T HE SUCCESS of Unesco, its ability to influence the
peoples of the world and to contribute to the main-
tenance of peace, will in the long run largely depend
on the efficiency and activity of National Com-
missions. They must interpret the purposes and programme of
Unesco in terms likely to appeal to their own public opinion.
They must advise their Governments on every issue relevant to
Unesco's functions which interests, or should interest, their
respective countries. And they should provide Unesco with the
information and national collaboration it requires to fulfil its
rioted tasks.
"A further point to emphasize is, that if they are to fulfil
their function. National Commissions and Co-operatin2'Bodies
must be provided with the secretariat, organisational and finan-
cial facilities required to exercize real activity.
"A final point is the part that the National Commissions can
play in the execution ;) f Unesco's programme, which is not a
series of operations centrally directed and executes by the Secre-
tariat in Paris, but a combined effort to which each country
can contribute. It will call for close and regular contact between
the Secretariat and the National Commissions."

against illiteracy begun in 1944
were followed by the world with
great attention, and the re-
markable result obtained receiv-
ed praise from all quarters.
Less attention, however, has
been paid to the succeeding
stages of the operation which, in
the opinion of the Mexican gov-
ernment itself, presented prob-
- lems even more difficult than
those overcome when the cam-
paign was first launched and
when half the people of Mexico
could neither read nor write.'
In a report made to Unesco at-
the time of the Second Session
of"the General Conference last
November, the Mexican govern-
ment gave a number of reasons
why the"follow up"of the origi-
nal campaign had its own special
difficulties. Among them were
the following :
1.) Because the time had pass-
ed when learning to read
and write was novel and
exciting for the people ;
2.) Because a large number of
people had already been
made literate, those illi-
terates who remained were
stubborn cases the teaching
of whom presented special
difficulties ;
3.) Because it was necessary
to find ways of maintaining
and increasing the interest
of those who had recently
been taught to read and
write.
A nation wide publicity cam-
paign, to which the president of
the Republic, Senor Aleman gave
all the authority of his person,
was instituted,
A"Corps of Special Visitors"
was created, members of which
after selection were given instruc-
tion and then sen't to different
parts of the country to organise
and guide the campaign.
These"Special Visitors", toge-
ther with mobile teaching col-
umns were asked to pay atten-
tion in particular to the setting
up of teaching centres in the
areas for which they were respon-
sible ;
in the light of the first part of
the general campaign against illi-
teracy, it was decided that, in the
."Follow Up"teáching should pre-
ferably be collective, as experience
had shown that t better results
were obtained at Fundamental
Education Centres where pupils
were taught in groups, rather
than individually.
A system 0 ; priocities was also
drawn up ; those who were to
have first claim on the instruc-
tors'time were children who, for
various'reasons were not attend-
ing school ; then came young per-
sons and finally older men and
women.
It was also recommended that
the duration of classes in the re-
gular Fundamental Education
Centres should be one and a half
hours, though in smaller rural
communities, served only by tra-
velling teachers, the length of
lessons could'be longer if required.
In, ordto make sure that those
who learned to read and write
during the first part of the funda-
mental education campaign retain-
ed and broadened their knowledge,
a special series of advanced
primers was ordered to be prepar-
ed, a wall newspaper for the same
purpose is to be published, and it
is hoped also to produce a Sunday
supplement to one of the news-
papers published in Mexico City.
For the use of those who speak
up Spanish, a series of primers
were compiled in such languages
as Maya, Tarasca, Nahua, Otomi,
Hahuatl and Totenaca.
A system 0 : rewards and punish-
ments for those taking part in the
campaign, whether students,
teachers or municipal officials is
being drawn up and a nation wide
publicity campaign has been
organized.


### 73701: France: Permanent Commission to broaden activities

THE INAUGURAL meeting ofthe permanent French Na-
tional Commission for Unesco will
be 7teZft at the Quaid'Orsay on
Thursday, March 4, in the pres-
ence of Mr. Georges Bidault,
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr.
Edouard Die, preux, Minister of
Education and Dr. Julian Huxley,
Director-General of Unesco. The
first programme session of the
permanent Commission is sche-
duled to be held on March 19.
This permanent National Com-
mission wilt thus succeed the
present provisional one which, on
its establishment in August 1946,
was one of the first National
Commissions to be set U1J by a
Unesco Member State.
In a report decently sMbm : tted
to Unesco'the provisional Na-
tMNCt ! Com77MSS ! 0 ? t r 0 U ! 0 M Sonal mission rev i e w s
France's participation in the
programme of Unesco for 1947'and
tie work of toe Commission.
"It was inevitable", the report
begins,"that France, which, at
the London Conference, gave
fProof of her interest in Unesco by
inviting he Organisation to es-
tabHsh the headquarters of its
permanent Secretariat on French
soil, should associate herself ac-
tively with the work of interna-
tional understanding undertaken
by the Organization".
"In spite of the (lestruction the
county has suffered", the re, port
continues,"France was determin-
ed to share to the full extent of
her means in the world-wade
campaign undertaken by, Unesco
for aid to the war-devastated
counties".
The provisional French Com-
mission consisted of 50 outstand-
ing personalities, including mem-
bers of Parliament, scholars,
educators, artists, senior civZ
servants and trade unionists. it
was organised into a nutnber of
programme committees, whose
task it was to study the best ways
by which France can assist Unesco
- in the execution of its programme,
its'surveys and other projects.
The Arts and Letters Committee,
for example, of the provisional
National Commission met last
year to study Unesco's proposals
for the creation of the Interna-
tional Theatre Institute. It brought
together some 30 French experts :
dramatists, composers, architects
and decorators, theatrical produc-
ers and actors. Under the chair-
manship of Mr. François Mauriac,
of the"Académie Française", the
board a. pproved the broad out-
lines of the Theatre Institute.
It also proposed that National
Theatre Committees be set up in
each of the Member States of the
proPQsed Institute.
France has shown her interest,
the report soes om to say, in the
project for the creation of the
Institute for the Hylean Amazon.
In 1947, the French Government
spent a noted educationalist, Pro-
fessor Erhart, to Brazil to attend
t3ie meetings of the Belém Com-
mission of Experts.
France has concerned herself
nut only with her awn ipToblems
oaf educatianal reconstructian, but
throughau ; t 1947, has shewn active
interest iz Uttesco's prpgramme
oaf aid to other mar-devastated
countries. Study and research 0
fellawships were placed at the
disposal'of Unesco by the French
Ministry of Natianal Educatian.
The University af Paris affered
the Organisation 220, 000 francs
fair the purchase af French books
ant teaching material. Further-
More, in June 1947, the Divisian
of Cultural Relations af the Min-
istry of Foreign Affairs gave 25,-
000 copies af French classics to.
Unesco. for distribution to. war-
damaged universities and school
af ather ca.' ! lntries.
The provisional Natianal COln-
missian fram the first attached
considerable impartance to Unes-
co's pragramme oaf Education fair
far Interrz. atianal Understanding.
Thus the Cammissian cipprooched
the Ministry af Educatian to.
study measures for developing in
French children and young
; people, a better'knowledge and
understanding af the rest of the
world. In this cannection it is
interesting to note, that the
M : K : str !/ o/WattONa ! Ed « c< ! tto ? tMinistry af Natianal Educatian
has already forwarded a circular
requesting that a special course
oz the United Natians shCíuld be-
made compulsary in all French
universities.
MKt The. provisianal Natianal Carn-The prou : s : OMtt ! NattOKa ! Com-
mission has also paid particular
attentian to Unesco's worn in
Fundamental Educatian. It decid-
ed to institute surveys and as-
se) information on the prab-
lems and resultl1c of fundamental
educatian in thè cauntries and
terrttohes af Overseas France,
and the applicatian thereto of
Unesco's work.
Unesco has never flailed to take
advantage af the experience af
French experts in the survey
and discussions which organisa-
tians spansored dealing with all
as, pects of its wark, Especially
Moteworthy were thee French cq ? t-
tributions in the fields af philo. :.
sophy and humanities, the social
sciences, the drafting af a De-
ctarottOK af Human Rights and
the surveying of the technical
needs af war-devastated cauntries
in the fields af mass cammunica-
tions.

### 73702: UNESCO takes part in U.N. press talks

The principal contrasting views
on the status and functions ot
the press existing today were the
subject of discussion during the
second session of the U. N. Sub-
Commission on Freedom of In-
formation which took place at
Lake Success from 17 January
two 3 February. Unesco was re-
presented at these meetings by
the Press chief of the Mass Com-
munications Section, M. René
Maheu. 
the twelve experts on the Sub-.
Commission drafted the articles
of the Declaration and Conven-
tion on Human Rights dealing
with freedom of information. In
ttddition they prepared a prelims-
nary report on"The Rights,
Obligations and Practices on the
Concept of Freedom of Informar
tion"for the forthcoming World
Conference on Freedom of In-
information and the Press, schedul-
ed to open at Geneva on 23
March.
Two opposing points of view
were expressed, with no compro-
mise possible between the two, by
a. majority of proponents of Li-
beralism and the Russian dele-
gate who advocated collective
ownership and State monopoly of
the media of information.
Pertinax (M. Andre Geraud) of
France and M. Sychrava of
Czechoslovakia, on the other hand
stressed the importance of both
responsibility and freedom in
news distribution, and pointed out
that a reasonable"equalisation"
of technical facilities and equi1>
ment should be a necessary pre-
liminary when considering fair
international competition.
Although the Unesco represen-
tative at the conference did not
take sides in these ideological dif-
ferences, he did point out that
the right of the general public to
information should take pre-
cedence over the individual's
right of expression. By this he
did not imply in any way the
denial of individual freedom of
/enquiry or expression or an at-
tack on property rights of au-
thors. or inventors. If it were
acknowledged, however, that the
. rights of the general public were
fundamental, it then became pos-sible to state the responsibilities
of spreading information in'terms
of voluntary self-discipline instead
of in terms of an external and
arbitrary tyranny.
The representative of Unesco
stressed the vital connection bet-
ween the ideas of freedom and
responsibility, pointing out that
"we must find a common ground
between the alternatives of free-
dom without responsibility-the
taw of the jungle-and responsi-
bility without freedom-the law
of the prison".
The Unesco representative also
pointed out the danger that cul-
ture faced through the"com-
mercialisation"of the news in-
dustries.
Thus, the meetings of the Sub-
Commission at Lake Success pro-
vided valuable information which
wiM : serve as e basis for the
forthcoming ussions at Go,-
neva. Here again Unesco will
take up the cause of intel-
lectual freedom and understand-
ing between the peoples of the
world by stressing the need for
mutual respect of ideas and cul-
tures.

as bright as ever.-
At my sinai press conlerence
at Mexico City I said that it
seems certain Unesco will con-
tribute something to world under-
standing ; and that it stands
perhaps a 10-pet cent chance to
live up to the soaring hope of
its constitution, providing it will
do four or five fundamental
things. That 10-percent chance
seems to me well worth all the
effort we can put into it. This
.. -
a real effort to collaborate, I
political alignments affect the
attitudes of delegations ;
2) The inadequacy of interna-
tional communications. The world
has developed its ability to des-
troy understanding far beyond its
ability to. preserve it, and its
power to incite hostility far
""YULlU lLéi puwt : r I
to inspire confi-
dence ;
3) The natural i
lethargy of men
who fee ! them-
selves safe from immediate dan-
ger. It seems to me that only
an honest appraisal of the true
state of world affairs, coupled
with an effective program to dra-
matize the need for better under-
standing, can overcome this
lethargy, which is perhaps the
greatest danger to the success of
Unesco.
THE great discovery most peoplemake who move around in
the world with open eyes is that
other nations have ways of doing
things which are altogether
strange-and yet work. To this
discovery there are two typical
reactions. One is :"That's dif-
ferent ; I don't like it."The other
is :"How interesting ; that's a
new line on things."Which of
these two reactions is forthcom-
ing decides in large part whether
there is to be international fric-
tion or international understand-
ing.
One way of making it more likely
that differences will be seen in
an attractive light is to let the
traveller into the secrets of the
foreign people he is visiting. If
he knows that they have this or
that peculiarity and then proceeds
to make the discovery for himself,
in his own personal contacts, the
chances that he will be saying
"How interesting..."are greater.
One of Unesco's main tasks is
to pave the way to international
understanding by every means
possible. It is accordingly setting
out on a piece of work which has
never been attempted on a world
scale before. In the course of the
next two years it hopes to be able
to present to the peoples of the
world a small bookshelf-twelve,
sixteen, twenty volumes perhaps-
handy in size, with a number of
illustrations, the titles of which
will read :"The American Way
of Life" ;"The Brazilian Way of
Life" ;"The British Way of Life" ;
"The French Way of Life" ;"The
Norwegian Way of Life" ;"The
Polish Way of Life","The Swiss
Way of Life", and so on for all
the principal peoples of the world.
Dipping into one of these books,
we should find a number of as-
pects of that nation-how the
people govern themselves, how
they educate themselves, how
would be true if the chance were
only 2-percent.
Here are some of the things
Unesco must do to win this par-
ticular one-in-ten bet :
1) It must find great leader-
ship. It must attract to its ser-
vice the ablest men and women
in the world ;
2) It must develop the means
by which peoples can talk directly
to peoples through the great
modem media of communication,
so that individuals of each nation
are in the most direct possible
intellectual and cultural contact
with individuals of other nations ;
3) Under Unesco's leadership,
standards of popular education
must be raised throughout the
world as rapidly as possible ; edu-
cation offers the most effective
resistance to the appeal of war ;
4) It must deserve as well as
receive an adequate budget. It is
true that Unesco is prepared to
spend only $7, 700, 000 effectively
in 1948. But it should be looking
toward the time when it can
efficiently spend 10 times that
much. That time will come with
strong leadership and with the
further development of vital
projects.
In the field of education, Unes-
co is now prepared to call the
best teachers of the world to-
gether to consider what are the
best teaching methods ; to gather
the best technical information on.
raising literacy standards ; to de-
velop the use of mass communica-
tions for education ; to call
regional study conferences and
adult-education seminars ; to sti-
mulate the schools of the world
to take a positive approach to
the teaching of international
understanding. There are projects
now ready for the first time to
be put into practical operation.

Work of Unesco Important
To Latin. American Countries
Ecuador Executive Board Member Says
In an interview recently granted
to a correspondent of the"Unesco
Courier", Dr Benjamin Carrion,
the newest member of Unesco's
Executive Board spoke of the im-
portance to Latin America of the
work of the Organi3ation and the
literature of his country, Ecuador.
Dr. Carrion, a distinguished
man of letters and diplomat of
the Ecuadorian Republic pointed
out that"International teamwork
in the fields of education, science
and culture is receiving the full
support of all of the countries in
Latin America.',
"The spirit of Spanish Amer-
ica,"he added,"is an open one.
It is essentially intellectual, and
rejects violence and brute force."
"Interest in Latin American
countries,', Dr. Carrion continued,
"is at present concentrated on the
Unesco project for the Institute
of the Hylean Amazon, since it
directly affects Brazil, Colombia,
Peru, Venezuela, Bolivia and
Ecuador. Unesco is performing an
important and necessary task in
summoning representatives to the
meetings in Peru and Brazil
which will establish the Institute.
Whatever the result of these
meetings-and I sincerely hope
they will be successful-they will
contribute to the ever increasing
development of co-operation
amongst our countries in South
America."
Turning to Unesco's programme
in Fundamental Education, Dr.
Carrion stated that Ecuador has
been active for several years in
a nation-wide campaign in this
field. One publishing house alone
has already printed more tflan
200, 000 reading primers, he de-
clared."I can assure you that the
Mexico Conference on Fundamen-
tal Education was greatly im-
pressed by our results in this
field. The work of education and
culture is difficult and requires
time. 1 ! : (mador for example is
extremely interested in the work
to begin soon on the proposed
Pilot Protect in Cuzco. Peru. Cer-
tainly the results achieved in ap-
plying Fundamental Education to
the native problems of the Cuzco
Indians can be usefully and
effectively applied to other area
and other climates."
At the close of his interview
with the"Unesco Courier"oor-
respondent, Dr. Carrion touched
very briefly on Ecuadorian litera-
ture."Ecuadorian writers of to-
day,"he stated."are particularly
concerned with the social prob-
lems of their country. The novel
'HuasipungO" (an Indian word
meaning'native land'), for exam-
ple, written by one of Ecuador's
Hading contemporary writers.
Jorge Icaza, is a forceful attack
against the exploitation of the
native Indian population. In a
sense it reflects the social and
political evolution of Ecuador
and the important influence of
the ideas of social justice on the
younger generation of today.
'Huasipungo'cannot be described
as a political book, since it is
devoid of political implications.
Rather it is a realistic work, the
product of a particular phase in
the history of our country."

### 73705: Way of life books planned by UNESCO

they look upon other peoples,
what things they have shown
themselves ready to die for-set
out in a manner which illustrates
the peculiar quality of that group
of human beings, their"national
character"as it is sometimes
called, their hopes, fears, beliefs
and values, their'way of life.'
Moreover, if we are particularly
interested in education, say, and
would like to know how the dif-
ferent forms of education are an
outgrowth of the way of life of
the different peoples, by reading
the comparable chapter right
through this small bookshelf and
we can have light on the world's
idea of education as never before.
Who would be likely to use such
a. bookshelf ? First, clearly, men
and women in universities who
are studying international rela-
tions. The very substance of inter-
national relations is understand-
ing the diverse ways of life of
the peoples of the world, of ap-
preciating how this diversity
makes for the richness of life,
and at the same time of perceiv-
ing the underlving unity upon
'which a viable world system can
be built. Second, in the inter-
national seminars organised by
Unesco,. these'Way of Life'
studies would clearly be of the
utmost value.
A reading of one another's
'Way of Life'should help to bringabout a d eper und standing-
even if it were no more than an
'agreement to differ,'provided
that e real source of the dif-
ference is realised. Third, the
staffs of the United Nations
would undoubtedly make use of
these books. When, for instance,
a Brazilian member of the Secre-
tariat of one of the U. N. organisa-
tions or agencies is visiting
Poland for the first time, the
volume entitled"The Polfsh Way
of Life"should be of value to
him. Hundreds, possibly thou-
sands, of such cases are likely
to arise every year. Fourth, when
a country appoints a new mem-
ber of its consular or diplomatic
service to some foreign country,
the"Way of Life'volume on that
country should go in his bag.
Generally, without multiplying
further instances, all travellers
whether travellers in the flesh or
travellers in the mind-should
find this series of value.
A pleasant idea, the critic
remarks, but how is it to be done ?
In this, Unesco is fortunate that
it can count upon an Organisa-
tion built up during the inter-
war period. The International
Studies Conference, for a number
of years before the Second World
War, had already brought togeth-
er most of the men and women
in the world engaged in the
scientific study of international
relations. In mor-than twenty
countries the International Stu-
dies Conference has National
Sections. which are effective oper-
ating units. It is these National
Sections, under the overall super-
vision of the International Stud-
ies Conference, that are assuming
responsibility for making the
'way of life'studies.
As will be seen, this provides
the means of dealing with the
two main difficulties encountered
in an enterprise of this kind. The
first difficulty is how a country's
way of life shall be presented in
a fashion that other countries
can understand
The other major problem is to
secure that the studies made are
not flights of fancy, but scientific
objective analyses-which, at the
same time, are readable, for if
they are not read there is little
punpose in their being made. To
deal with this, the National Sec-
tions will choose an experienced
writer in this field to make the
book, while a small group of
specially chosen experts in inter-
national relations will review it
for its scientific accuracy.
Four National Sections have
voluntereed to be what Dr. Julian
Huxley called the"llUinea-pigs,"
the first to make the experiment.
It is hoped to bring their spokes-
men togethw r in Unesco House in
March and to work out the
broad lines of this first large-
scale co-operative study of the
creative diversity of the peoples
of the world.

A CHINESE PIONEER
Sites for three Unesco educa-
tional seminars to be held this
summer, bringing together out-
standing educators from all parts
of the world, were officially an-
nounced on Februrary 24 at Unes-
co House.
Unesco has communicated wlth
its fortv-one Member States, re-
Questing Ministries of Education
to arrange for representative par-
ticipants in the seminars. The
participants are to be key educa-
tional personnel in each country,
men and women who will be able
to influence the teaching prac-
tices of their home countries on
their return from the seminars.
The seminars play an important
rle in the programme of Unesco,
for through them Unesco hopes
not only to raise educational
standard throughout the world,
but to bring together influential
persons in the field of education
and thus strenRthen the bonds
of international understanding
among all peoples.
The first of the seminars, wi1l
concern"Teacher Education"and
will be held for six weeks in or
near London during July and
August. The invitation to meet
in England came from the Brit-
ish government.
The second seminal. will con-
cern"ChildhoOd. EducatIOn"and
is planned for Prague for a
period of six weeks, alsn this
summer.
The third seminar on"Teach-
ing about the United Nations and
its Specialised Agencies"will be
held for six weeks during July
and August at Adelphi College,
in Garden C : ty near Lake Suc-
cess, New York. Close co-opera-
t'on in this seminar will be main-
tained with the United Nations.
It is planned to have some
sixty educators attend each of
the seminar, which are an exten-
ion of the first such experiment I
by Unesco last year. At that time,
nearly one hundred key world
educators attended a six-week
seminar on"Education for Inter-
national Understandmg,"at Sè-
vres, near Paris, and was attended
by representatives of thirty-on
nations.
For the three seminars schedul-
ed this year, Unesco will pay the
administrative costs and board
and room expenses of each parti-
cipant. The governments will be
expected to arrange for the travel
expenses of : heir participants.
A fourth seminar is projected
for 1948 in which Unesco will co-
operate with the Pan American
Union, and which it is hoped will
attract representatives from all
the Latin American countries.
Subject for study at this seminar
will be"Educational Problems in
South America"
In all of the seminars, a similar
programme will be followed. Gen-
eral meetings of the participants
will be held regularly, along with
small s'udy groups to consider
specific aspects of the main
subject.

Nations, M. Jean Thomas. As-
sistant Director-General of Unes-
co was invitecl to acldress an au-
clience of professors and students
at the orbonne. He spoke on
the subject of"Unesco and the
Problems of Culture"before
nembers or the"Groupement
universitaire pour le, ç Nations
Unies"and inz ; ited guests.
M. Thomas pointed out that the
United Nations might be thought
of as the sun, and Unesco as one
of the planets revolving round
it, but this did not mean that
Unesco's work was secondary or
strictly dependent on the United
Nations. Comparing the disap-
pointments met with in the Lea-
gue of Nations with the much
more positive history of the I. L-0.
(International Labour Office),
before the war, M. Thomas indi-
cated that the Specialised Agen-
cites were often less vulnerable
than the central political organ-
Isation."Unesco, of course is not
entirely unaffected by. politics.''
he said,"but on the cultural
plane, it can achieve agreements
provided it deals with problems
prom a practical angle."
The Assistant Director-General
thus considered Unesco's work
from the practical point of view
and showed how it was meeting
real problems arising in the mod-
ern world on the cultural plane.
The first question to which
Unesco sought an answer, he
said, was that of"cultural Isola-
tIonism."Unesco's task was to
broaden the horizons of the dif-
ferent peoples of the world, to
bring them into touch with
other modes of thought and
behaviour. This did not mean,
he continued, that Unesco was
seeking to set up a single culture
or to enable one particular cul-
ture to dominate the. others
"Unesco,"said M. Thomas."does
not wish to impose on the world
ether a single school of art or
a. single school of philosophy.
The very notion of a single cul-
ture is absurd to-day."
The second problem of direct
! interest to Unesco, with regard
to the development of culture, M.
Thomas stated was that of the
participation in cultural life of a
larger sections of society. RIO
stressed this as a very important
aspect of the Orgamsation's
work."Unesco,"he said,"atta-
ches the highest importance to
the specalised work of scientists,
philosophers and creative artists,
and devotes a large proportion of
Us funds to the dissemination
and''popularisation'of culture...
We must bear in mind, the num-
ber 0= people who can be reach-
ed to-day by the cinema, gfamo-
phone records, the press and ra-
dio. The mfluence of such mod-
ern instruments of culture 1ß
vast. and it cannot be said that
they are at present fulfilling
their true omission of raising the
cultural interests of the public."
Accordingly, Unesco is encoucag-
ing the production of articles.
films and radio programmers of
cultural value he declared, and
is taking positive steps to facil-
itate tAeir distribution in the dif-
ferent cultural areas of the
world.
"Unesco,"he said,"may not
yet be known to the general
public. But the main thing is
that its programme should reach
the masses through a series of
concrete result. It is actually of
minor importance whether the
public's collaboration is a con-
scious or unconscious one."

### 73708: A Chinese pioneer: Dr. Yen describes work of mass education in China

Dr. Yen Describes Work
of Mass Education in China
(EDITOR'S NOTE : We reproduce below the abridged t<xt of an
address by Dr. James Yen, one of the pioneers in the Mass Education
Movement in China, delivered last year at the Unesco sponsored
Summer Seminar in Education for International Understanding at
Sevres, France.
by Dr. James YEN,
Director, Collage of Rural Reconstruction, Hsih-
Ma Chang. ChungkIng, China ; Founder and Dlrector
of the Chinese Movement for Mass Education.
Z`OR ABOUT
twenty-six
years I have be-
longed to the
Chmese M o v e-
ment for Mass
Education. This
movement ori-
ginated, not m
China, but III
France during
the first world
war. Chines
took part in this
war on the
battlefields or
France ; Chmese
workers shared
in, the work of
military e n g i-
neering corps
and in war pro-
duction in Fran-
ce, Great Bri
tain and the
United States.
But these Chi-
nese combatants
and workers
were very un-
happy owing to
their ignorance
of the French
and English lan-
guages. They
were isolated.
and received no news of theJr
famines or their country. The
French and British authorities
asked for volunteers-students-
to serve as interpreters for these
men In this way it came abou :
that I embarked for France.
It was the opinion in China for
centuries that scholars alone
should learn to read and write.
That was the exclusive privilege
of the scholars. For centuries'it
had been the view that ordinary
folk the people-should not and
could not read : the farmer, the
worker could not and should not
learn such an art. I decided, how-
ever. to try, and to undertake the
education of my men. It was my
idea to form a httle school, where
I could teach them to read and
write.
I began with very simple words
and sentences. I composed pages
for reading. At the end of my pro-
gramme of work 35 out of 40 of
my pupils had entirely succeeded.
This experiment became known,
and I was asked to develop and
apply it to the educacion of 200, 000
Chinese workers then in France.
We then joined up with Chinese
volunteers, like myself, in France,
Great Britain and the United
Staes. We organised in Paris a
seminar which lasted for some
ten days. Together we prepared
and set on foot a programme and
scheme of teaching. Classes were
organised throughout France.
The 1st Congress of the International Theatre Institute wit ! be held
at the Palace of the Xational Council, Prague, shown above. A
seminar on Child Education wild also be held in Prague this SUII1Dler.
That was the
begmning of the
Chinese Move-
ment for Mass
Education.
In China, we
worked out our
methods of
teaching more
thoroughly,
more scientific-
ally. We chose a
vocabulary suit-
able for the pur-
poses of aver-
ages pupil level.
The Chinese
language com-
prises some 40,-
000 characters.
The current lan-
guage of every-
day life involves
the use of be-
tween four and
five thousand
characters.
A farmer, a
worker or a ci-
tizen must know
about 1, 300 ba-
sic characters.
We have pub-
lished diction-
aries and other
t, nn4e rnrtainina
the main characters 1 : 0 i) e Jearneu.
A programme of work has been
drawn up providing for one hour's
lesson each day, except Sundays,
for a period of four months. This
educational scheme enable the
pupils to read papers, pamphlets
and other publications issue for
their benefit.
We have a service of 100. 000
teachers, all of them volunteers,
who devote several hours of thir
time each day, without any remu-
neration, to the education of he
masses. These teachers belong to
every educational grade.
This movement has constitute
a veritable revolution in China : 11
has brought together coolies and
scholars. The thousard-year-cd
barriers between these two social
classes have been broken down,
and a truly democratic movement
has been set on foot.
The fight against illiteracy was
only the first step in the task to be
accomplished. We wanted to estab-
lish a complete range of instruc-
tion, to found a true educational
system.
In China 85% of the total popu-
lation of some 400 to 500 I1111líons
live in the country provmces,
spread out over thousands of
small villages. We therefore felt,
that the duty of us student, of
us scholars, was not to visit hera-
ries but to go into the country.
Four : \Iain Difficulties
The problems to be solved were
many and vast. but they were
connected in a general way wah
the following four fundamental
points : (1) illiteracy. (2t poveny,
(3) disease. (4) bad government.
We applied our system, uhich
enabled the people to learn to
read and write in four months
as a result of one hours work a
day.
Six school for demomtra tlon
were founded, and verve run enti-
rely at the expense of the Chinese
Movement for Mass Education. By
degrees, hundreds of schools were
established, with the result thac
every village in the county soon
had a school, known as the
"school of the people".
The result was excellent, for
after three years'work th ;
movement had, of itself, developed
to such a point that more than
80. 000 young people, from 18 to
25 years of age, had passed
through them. These young
people Mt the need of
forming associations-"FeHcw
Scholar Associations''-They
founded a paper called"The
Farmer", and also introduced
radio into the villages. Theatrics !
events were organised ; dramas
and small plays where performed ;
theatrical compames traveled
from one village to another.
There is a vast medical problem
to be solved in China. This prob-
lem has a dual aspect. In the
first place, public health in China
is bad because of the poverty of
the population. In the second
place, health services, particularly
medical personnel, are notoriously
inadequate. China has only one
doctor per 75, 000 or so inhabi-
tants.
We established in our"labora-
tory county"the following sys-
tem : we mobilised all the good
will, all the elements which were
capable of receiving rapid first-
aid and medical training.
The health centre was the
county, with its hospital and its
complete and perfected equipment.
This system permitted the maxi-
mum protection of public health
with the very'imited resources
available. It had such satisfactory
results that the Chinese Govern-
ment appointed groups of doctors
to the different counties, with
the recommendation that an or-
ganisation similar to that in our
"laboratory county"be institute.
A Table with Three Legs
We had set on foot an educa-
tional, agricultural and a health
programme. For these to be effec-
tive they had to be authorised
and applied. But for the purpose
of applying them we had, at the
head of the county, only one
authority, that of the governor 01
the county, generally corrupt ;
dishonest, and abov all indiff
rent to social problems.
I sought an interview with
General Chang-Kai-Shek and told
him that we possessed a table
with three legs an educational,
an agricultural and a pUb1Ïe
health leg-and that we abso-
lutely had to have a fourth leg
so that the whole structure should
be solid. This fourth prop was the
support. of the government. I
asked him to entrust us with a
single county, our"laboratory
county''of about 400, 000 souls ; to
entrust us with the government
of that area. A year and a half
later we received a favourable
reply.
We are a movement of the
people. Our action has gradually
spread throughout all China. Our
results were achieved in seven
years, from 1929 to 1936.
A rind Problem
But these problems are not
peculiar to mv country. Three-
quarters of the inhabitants of the
world are in like case. I have been
to India, and the problems af-
flicting China are the same as
those afflicting India. I have been
to Cuba, and there the problems
are the same.
Unesco is a great institution,
but m order to succeed at mu. st
work with the object of us : ng the
resources of the privileged quarter
of the world to raise the stand-
ards of the non-privileged three-
quarters. I know that this will
take a certain time and that. it is
only by degrees that we shati sue-
ceed in improving the living con-
ditions of the masses of humanist, .

tinuny and greater resources, the
admirable efforts of the past.
Only an international body,
jomtly maintained by the coun-
tries of the Amazon forest region
and those which, although not a
part of it, are specially interested
in the problems of the natural
and social sciences peculiar to it,
is capable of ensuring lasting
results to such an undertaking.
The reception given by Bolivia,
Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Vene-
zuela and the three Guianas to
the project submitted to Unesco
by Brazil, is proof of the oppor-
tuneness and possibilities which it
holds. The support and co-opera-
tion which the United States of
America and India have proposed
to give it are further evidence of
the international character and
scientific significance of this plan.
In close co-operation with the
different countries and territories
of the Amazon, the proposed
IIHA would undertake all work
which, within the framework en-
visaged by the Convention of the
Institute, would be of direct inter-
est to them. The results thus ob-
tained would, moreover, be of
eventual benefit to all the tro-
pical zones of our planet.
The first meeting of experts
held in Belem do Para, Brazil,
in 1947,, with a view to creating
the IIHA, drew up in detail a
plan of work. The many problems
relating to the natural environ-
ment and conditions of life of
man in the equatorial forest weir
examined. The scientific mrveys
and researches recommended
include the subjects of physiogra-
phy, pedology, botany, zoology,
agriculture, social sciences and
education.
Among the many projects con-
tained in the general plan of the
Institute, some can be carried out
immediately, while others will re-
quire many years of patient toil.
Among the suggestions for the
future work of the Institute are
the establishment of regional
research centres in such places as
Iquitos, Peru : Belem, Brazil ; and'
Riberalta, Bolivia.
The proposed Institute wound
work closely with, and, as far as
possible, through institutes locat-
ed in the countries of the Hylean
Amazon region. The programme
of the Institute would also take
cognizance of the research under
way on problems closely related to
those of this region in research
institutions in other parts of i. he
world.
It is hoped that, at the forth-
coming meeting, representatives
of the interested Governments
twill sign the draft Convention and
set up an interim commission to
serve until the Member States
have ratified the Convention, and
the Institute comes fo : t. lally int<J
existence.
It is estimated that during the
first year of operatior the Ins-
titute could effectively carry out
a programme costing approximat-
ely $300, 000, excluding the expen-
ditures for buildings and per-
manent equipment.

### 73709: Ex-enemy states discussed

EX. ENEMY STATES
DISCUSSED
Negotiations are under way be-
tween Unesco and Occupation Au-
thorities in Germany to determme
what elements of the Unesco pro-
gramme may be carried out in
that country. Similar discussions
will be initiated shortly with the
Allied Control Authority of Japan.
The Executive Board at its first
1948 session in Paris daring
February, reviewed negotiations
which have been carried on to
date between Unesco and the
Allied Control Authorities in Ger-
many, aimed at the extension of
elements of Unesco's world pro-
gramme into former enemy states.
It decided also that similar ne-
gotiations should be undertaken
immediately with the Control
Authority of Japan.
Letters were dispatched by the
Director-General to the military
commanders of the four Occu-
pation Zones of Germany, and
an answer from General Lucius
D. Clay (U. S. A.) was received
inviting further discussion on
the subject.
The Executive Board approved
a resolution that Dr. Huxley and
Dr. Walker prepare a joint re-
port on the overall picture of tille
negotiations for consideration at
a specially-convened session early
in April.

### 73710: UNESCO promotes development of national book exchange centers

Unesco Promotes
Development of
National Book
Exchange Centers
The Second General Confe-
rence, Mexico City. November
1947, instructed the Secretariat of
Unesco to"promote the organi-
sation, maintenance and develop-
ment of national book exchang :
and distribution centres".
These book centres are already
operating in such countries as the
United States of America and the
United Kingdom and have, in the
past, been able to send important
quantities of books and periodical3
to war-damaged Ji. bra. ries through-
out the world. Most of the ma-
terial which has in this manner
been used for the benefit of edu-
cation, science and culture would
normally have gone to the paper
mills and thus been lost.
Not only in the U. S. and the
U. K. but in many other coun-
tries as well, vast and re1atively
untapped reserve of books exist
which could be made available
to war-damaged areas provided
appropriate organizations for
their collection, allocation and
distribution can be established.
It will be the task of the book
centres which Unesco has been
instructed to promote wherever
possible, to collect and distribute
these books and to yet them into
the hands of those who actually
require them, and to avoid"book
dumping".
These Centres will be National
Book Centres, and not centres
under Unesco's administration,
but Unesco's Clearing House will
cooperate with such centres in
the allocation of material to the
libraries which are the mosc in
need of It
It should be well understood
that book centres in war-
damaged countries should in the
frst place servo the needs of its
home libraries, and only the ma-
teal not actually needed within
the country will be made availa-
ble to libraries abroad.
At the same time, these Cen-
tres will act as focus points to
which gifts will be addressed
from donors abroad for appro-
priate distribution inside the
country. It is also hoped that in
due course these book centres
will develop into permanent ex-
change centres, used not only in
the interest of reconstruction
but al o in the service of perma-
nent library needs, e. g. for the
exchange of literature usually
exchanged intemationaliy.
In accordance with the reso-
lution above quoted, Unesco with
the cooperation of the Tempo-
rary International Council. for
Educational Reconstruction (T I.
C. E. R.) has endeavoured to pro-
mote the creation of a Trench
National Book Centre ; and it its
hoped that this Centre will stóut
functioning in the near future.
