Sumerian books in clay
This terracotta tablet (presented to Unesco by the Government of Iraq) measures barely 4 by 9 cm. (2 by
3.5 in.). It is inscribed with the cuneiform characters of the ancient Sumerian language. Thousands of
such " books in clay " have been discovered : legal documents, business contracts, lists of food allocations,
palace inventories, even geometrical problems. They help us to visualize the brilliant Sumerian civilization
which developed in the Tigris and Euphrates valley of Mesopotamia from 3500 B.C. Skilful architects,
sculptors and goldsmiths, the Sumerians invented a system of writing that became one of the most
important in the ancient world. Their inscribed clay tablets reveal them also as efficient accountants,
archivists, schoolmasters and tax collectors. Dating from the reign of Shu-Sin (2036-2028 B.C.) a
king of the third Ur dynasty, this tablet records details of the State's corn revenues.

LADY OF THE LAMP
In 1968, almost 3,000 archaeological
treasures were recovered from two
royal tombs at Man-ch'eng in northeast
China (see article page 12 and centre
colour pages). Among them was this
2,000-year-old gilt bronze lamp, in¬
genious in its concept and mechanism.
The right arm of the girl holding the
lamp is a sort of chimney which evac¬
uates the smoke into the body of
the statuette, thus acting as perhaps
one of the earliest anti-air pollution
devices known. The figure pivots on
a movable base allowing the position
of the lamp to be adjusted; the intensity
and direction of the light can also be
controlled by means of a sliding shutter.
The lamp stands 48 cm (19 in.) high
and is thought to have come originally
from the Chang-hsin palace.

### 52729: China, true birthplace of paper, printing and movable type

IIN the development of the
art of bookmaking in the modern
format, a text printed with black ink
on white paper, the Chinese have
probably contributed the most.
It is generally known that paper was
invented in China around the begin¬
ning of the Christian era, and spread
all over the world before the modern
age. Wood-block printing was first
used by the Chinese in the seventh
or eighth century and movable type
some four hundred years earlier than
Gutenberg. Even the use of the
indelible ink of lampblack, which has
been manufactured under the misnomer
"Indian ink", can be traced back to
antiquity in Chinese civilization.
It was the introduction of these
vehicles that made possible the pro¬
duction of multiple copies of a modern
paged book for wide circulation.
Printing has been regarded as the
mother of civilization, and paper as its
carrier to perpetuate man's ideas and
aspirations and expand their capacity
for diffusion and exchange. Paper
and printing represent two of the four
great Chinese inventions (the other
two are gunpowder and the compass)
that contributed to the modernization
of the West.
No other achievements by the people
of the ancient world can compare in
importance with the invention of paper
and the art of printing that was born
from it. Both have a far-reaching
impact upon the intellectual life of
modern people. Can one imagine that
if paper ceased production or printing
were unknown today, what would
happen in daily life in a modern
society? Even though other media of
communication are available, they
cannot substitute for the function of
paper and printing, which is basic and
permanent.
Paper is a felted sheet of fibres
formed on a fine screen from a water
suspension. When the Water drains
away, it leaves a mat of fibres to be
dried. Over a span of two millennia
since the inception of the idea of
papermaking, the art has been changed
and the tools have become complicated,
but the basic principles and processes
remain the same.
The invention of paper in China
originated from the process of pound¬
ing and stirring rags in water, several
centuries before Christ. It is very
likely that an accidental placing of
fibres from the rags on a mat with
water draining away may have suggest¬
ed the idea of making a thin sheet of
paper.
Scholars of the West have sometimes
questioned the Chinese origin of paper-
making. Their doubt resulted partly
from the derivation of the word "paper"
from "papyrus" and partly from their
ignorance about the nature of
Chinese paper.
Papyrus, used earlier than paper,
was made of laminated slices from
papyrus reeds, while paper is a
manufactured product of fibres. The
origin of paper derived from the
writing on textile with its subsequent
improvement to become paper as an
economical substitute.
Paper and textiles were closely
related. Not only were they originally
made of the same kinds of raw material,
but also similar in physical format and
properties. Even their uses were
interchangeable.
The chief difference between them
was probably in the process of their
manufacture and thus in their cost of

THE OLDEST PIECE OF PAPER IN THE WORLD
The oldest piece of paper In the world, this fragment of paper (above),
dating back to the 2nd century B.C., was discovered recently In a tomb at
Pa-ch'lao, in the Shensi province of northern China. It has pushed back the
date of the invention of paper to over two centuries before the time of
T'sai Lun, traditionally regarded as the inventor of paper. The papermaking
techniques developed by Tsai Lun and described to the Imperial court In
105 A.D. undoubtedly represented a big advance In the art of papermaking.
T'sai Lun and his papermaking methods are depicted (below) on commemorative
stamps issued by the People's Republic of China.
production. Textiles were made by
weaving spun threads of fibres by
physical means, while paper was
formed by the mixture of disintegrated
fibres into a felted sheet by chemical
processes.
The invention of paper has been
attributed to T'sai Lun, .an official in
charge of manufacture, who reported
to the Court in 105 A.D. his method
of papermaking with tree bark, hemp,
rags and fish nets. This traditional
date of invention was probably arbitrar¬
ily chosen, since there is evidence for
the existence of paper made of plant
and silk fibres prior to his time.
The recent discovery of very ancient
paper fragments in north China indi¬
cates its origin before Christ. Frag¬
ments of this oldest paper are reported
as having been found in Pa-ch'iao,
Shensi province, in 1957, in a tomb
dated no later than the second century
B.C. If this is true, the beginning of
Chinese papermaking may have to be
pushed back at least some two
centuries before T'sai Lun.
The role of T'sai Lun, however, may
have been as an innovator of new
materials, which had not been used
before, and of new techniques for
treating them. The supply of rags and
other second-hand materials was limit¬
ed and the introduction of fresh fibres
from tree bark and other plants
provided new sources of raw materials,
and thus made it possible for paper-
making on a large scale to meet the
increasing demand.

HE major raw materials
for Chinese papermaking include such
bast plants as hemp, jute, flax, ramie
(China grass), and rattan; the bark of
the mulberry and paper mulberry;
grasses such as bamboo, reeds, and
stalks of rice and wheat; and such
seed fibres as cotton. Hemp and
cotton are probably the best, produc¬
ing the highest yields of pure and
long fibres, but as they are needed
primarily for the textile industry, paper
mulberry and bamboo have been the
chief raw materials for papermaking
in China for many centuries.
Although paper had been used for
writing probably as early as it was
invented, it was not until the third
century A.D. that bamboo and wooden
tablets were entirely replaced by paper
as the material of Chinese books.
We have also found that from this
time on, paper began to be made with
a fine screen-mould, sized and loaded
to improve its quality for writing, and
dyed with an insect repellent for
permanence. It was also made in
different colours and designs for

### 52729: China, true birthplace of paper, printing and movable type

writing poems, notes, and letters, and
cut into patterns for embroideries and
decorations.
Paper was also extensively used
for documents and bookmaking, for
painting and calligraphy, for calling
cards, for offerings to the spirits, for
wrapping, for covering windows, and
for such household articles as fans,
umbrellas, lanterns, kites, toys, and
even sanitary and toilet papers. All
of these were accomplished or used
before the close of the sixth century.
From the seventh or eighth century
onward, paper is known to have been
used in making hats, garments, pants,
bed sheets, mosquito nets, curtains,
and other household furnishings and
appliances. It was also used in
making screens, tiles, and even armour.
The use of paper as "flying money" to
substitute for heavy metallic coins was
formally introduced in the early ninth
century.
Marco Polo was among the early
European visitors to China who wit¬
nessed the wide circulation of paper
money and the extravagant burning of
paper effigies and replicas as offerings
to the dead in the empire of the great
Khan. The Mongol expansion resulted
in the introduction of paper money,
playing cards, and many other objects
of paper and printing to other parts
of the world.
The Persians first issued in 1294
paper money, for which the Chinese
name ch'ao (money) was adopted. It
is said that certain old systems in
European banking, accounting, and
even money deposit vouchers were
influenced by some of the Chinese
examples.
Wallpaper also is said to have
originated in China. It was first
brought to Europe by French mission¬
aries in the sixteenth century and
has been imitated there since the
seventeenth century. How early it
was used in China is uncertain, but the
decoration of Chinese houses with
hanging scrolls of painting and calli¬
graphy was a very ancient and com¬
mon practice. It is possible that these
paper scrolls were first hung and later
adapted to being pasted on the walls
of European houses.
The use of paper made books much
cheaper and more portable, but their
multiplication and wide distribution
was not possible until the invention
of printing. It is uncertain when and
where the first book was printed in
China and who was the earliest
printer. The beginning of the art must
have been a process of gradual
development and been participated in
by many people, especially the reli¬
gious devotees from whom great
numbers of duplicates of their sacred
writings were in demand.
There was a long history of pre¬
printing techniques of duplication in
China, including the use of seals for
stamping on clay and later on paper,
of stencils to duplicate designs on
textiles and on paper, and of inked
impressions taken from stone inscrip¬
tions. All these processes paved the
way for the use of wood-block printing.
The earliest possible date for the
beginning of printing in China is
probably around 700 A.D. The discov¬
ery in Korea in 1965 of a Buddhist
charm in Chinese, printed no later
than 751 A.D., and a previously known
charm also in Chinese, printed in Japan
around 770 A.D., indicate that printing
at that time was already a refined and
widespread craft. Since both Korea
and Japan were under the influence of
Chinese culture long before the time
when these texts were printed, there
is little doubt that this technique was
introduced from China.
N10 printed material of
comparable date has been found in
China, but specimens of the ninth and
tenth centuries were discovered there
and survive today. These include the
famous Diamond sutra, a complete
book in a paper roll printed in 868 A.D.,
calendars of 877 and 882, many single
sheets of Buddhist pictures of 947-983,
and two versions of an invocation
sutra printed in 957 and 973. All these
early specimens of printing are more
or less related to Buddhism; Confucian
classics were not printed until the first
part of the tenth century.
After that time, printing was widely
applied and perfected through the
efforts of many official, private, reli¬
gious, and commercial agencies. The
Chinese printing of the eleventh
to thirteenth centuries, which may
be compared with the European
incunabula, is especially noted for its
excellence in paper, ink, calligraphy,
illustration, workmanship, and in many
other respects.
All the wood blocks were selected
from deciduous trees: the pear, jujube,
catalpa, and sometimes apple, for their
smooth and even texture. The manu¬
script, written on a thin sheet of paper,
was transferred upside down to the
surface of the block by means of rice
paste. When dry, the backing of paper
was scraped off, leaving a thin tissue
showing the characters in the reverse
position remaining on the block.
The cutter then removed the surface
of the block around the characters
with gauges, picks, and chisels. When

These books consisted of bamboo tablets
connected with string and used like
a paged book of modern times. Bamboo
and wood were the most popular
materials for writing (along with silk)
before the Invention of paper.

the block was ready, it was inked with
a hair brush. A sheet of paper was
then placed on the inked block and
brushed over the back with a soft
brush. It was said that a skilled printer
could turn out some 1,500 to 2,000
sheets of double pages in a day.
The art of Chinese printing was
further developed through the intro¬
duction of movable type in the eleventh
century and of multi-colour printing in
the fourteenth century. According to
a contemporary record, a font of
earthenware movable type was used
by a craftsman named Pi Sheng in
about 1 041 -1 048. He cut the characters
in the soft clay and baked them in a
fire. The type was set on a plate with
a mixture of resin and wax. A flat
board was pressed over the surface
to even out the block of types. Several
plates were used alternately and the
printing was done rapidly.
Other materials were later introduc¬
ed to make movable type, including
wood in the early thirteenth century
and bronze in the late fifteenth and
the sixteenth century. The types made
of wood, bronze, tin, lead, and
ceramics were used repeatedly but
intermittently in the following centuries.
Printing with more than one colour
was used as early as 1340 and
advanced in the late seventeenth
century when many manuals of paint
ings and patterned stationery were
printed in multi-colour. This was done
by means of a series of separate
blocks, one for each colour, applied
to the paper in succession. This
method was used especially in printing
book illustrations, maps, stationery,
and texts with punctuation and com¬
mentaries.
Throughout the ages, the wood-block
printing was the main trend of Chinese
book production while movable type
was only occasionally used. Because
of the nature of the Chinese vocabulary
with a large number of individual
characters, the block printing was more
simple and economical to operate.
After required copies were printed, the

THE INVENTION OF MOVADLE TYPE
The invention of movable type in the 11th century A.D.
was another notable "first" for China and a giant
step forward in printing technique. Experiments were
made with many different materials including earthen¬
ware, wood, bronze, tin and lead. Above, a bronze

B.C. philosophical work, printed in blue colour In

the Wu Ying Palace. Illustrations taken from "Chung-
kuo pan-k'o t'u-lu", National Peking Library, 1961.
blocks could be easily stored and
used over again, when additional
copies were needed.
Only when voluminous books were
produced on a large scale, movable
type was preferred. Since the middle
of the nineteenth century, both block
printing and the traditional movable
type have been gradually replaced by
modern printing techniques, including
lithography, typography, and other
machine printing.
After paper was invented, it not only
became popular in China but spread
in all directions throughout the world.
Its introduction to other countries must
have occurred in two stages: first
paper books and other paper products
arrived in these countries to be
followed later by the paper manufactur¬
ing methods.
Paper moved eastward to Korea in
the second century, to Japan in the
third century, southward to Indo-China
no later than the third century and to
India before the seventh century, and
westward to Central Asia in the
third century, to western Asia in the
eighth century, to Africa in the tenth
century, to Europe in the twelfth
century, and to America in the sixteenth
century.
It has often been said that the
Chinese kept secret their knowledge
of papermaking until a few paper-
makers were captured by the Arabs
in the eighth century, when this secret
was revealed to the outside world.
This is certainly not true. The slow
movement to the West was due primar¬
ily to geographical and cultural isola¬
tion rather than to secretiveness, since
papermaking was introduced to China's
immediate neighbours as soon as they
began to have contacts with Chinese
culture.
When the eastward diffusion of
Chinese culture began, Koreans first
acquired Chinese books on paper and
borrowed Chinese characters as their
writing in the second century. By way
of Korea, Chinese books were in-

### 52729: China, true birthplace of paper, printing and movable type

CHINESE PAPER AND PRINTING (Continued from page 9)
traduced to Japan at the beginning of
the third century.
However, the craft of papermaking
was not begun in Japan until 610 A.D.,
when a Korean monk, who had learned
inkmaking and papermaking in China,
went to Japan and suggested its
manufacture to the Japanese court.
After this time, hundreds of priests
and students from both Korea and
Japan were sent to China to study and
to acquire books. The Chinese craft
of printing must have been learned by
these students and applied in their own
countries when they returned.
How early papermaking moved
southward is uncertain, but it must
have been very early. Chinese
records show that in the late third
century, paper made of special mater¬
ials native to Indo-China was sent to
the Chinese court as a tribute. It is
assumed that the Indo-Chinese learned
the craft from the Chinese. Even
today, the methods used by Indo-
Chinese papermakers are said to be
more closely related to those of China
than of any other Asian country.
As to the printing of books, the Indo-
Chinese have acquired many kinds of
Chinese literature, including Confucian,
Buddhist, and Taoist canons, medical
works, and novels, ever since the tenth
century. Books in Chinese and in
bilingual text of Chinese and Viet¬
namese were printed there for many
centuries with wood blocks, movable
type, and colour process, as was done
in China.
The introduction of paper to India
was probably not later than the seventh
century. A Chinese monk named
l-ching who travelled to India in 671-
694, mentioned the Sanskrit word
kákali for paper in his Chinese-Sanskrit
dictionary. Since the sacred texts of
India were memorized and transmitted
orally for ages, paper was probably
not popular there until the Mohammed¬
an period after the twelfth century.
The use of printing reached India even
much later.
Papermaking travelled westward to
Samarkand in 751 A.D., when two
Chinese papermakers were taken pris¬
oner and introduced the craft to the
Arabic world. A second factory was
started in Baghdad some forty years
later when Chinese papermakers were
brought to that city. From this time,
papermaking spread to the cities of
Damascus and Tripoli, and to Yemen,
Egypt, and Morocco. The Arabs
monopolized papermaking in the West
for some five centuries before it was
introduced to Europe in the twelfth
century.
After the Moors conquered the
Iberian peninsula, they brought the
craft to Spain and established a paper
factory in Xátiva in about 1150. A mill
for maceration of rags was also operat¬
ed there.
Another route which carried the
craft to Europe was probably across
the Mediterranean through Sicily to
Italy from Egypt or Palestine. Paper
mills are known to have been estab¬
lished in Italian cities of Babriano,
Bologna, and Genoa, from the late
thirteenth century, and in several cities
in France and Germany in the four¬
teenth century.
The famous papermaker Ulman
Stromer, who built a paper mill in
Nuremberg about 1390, used tools and
processes, including the water-power¬
ed stampers, similar to those used in
China. The craft was introduced to
the Netherlands, Switzerland, and
England in the fifteenth century and
brought to the New World in the
sixteenth century to Mexico before
1580 and to the American colonies
toward the end of the seventeenth
century.
Throughout a long history of over
fifteen hundred years, paper travelled
from China to almost every part of the
world. Whether printing in Europe
was influenced by the Chinese is
debatable, but knowledge of Chinese
printing and many printed articles from
China were certainly known in Europe
before the first printing there was
accomplished.
The origin of paper in China and its
borrowing by many others is definite
and certain. Papermaking, which was
already a fully developed art before
its spread from China, is probably the
most complete of the inventions that
China has given to the world.
This woodcut by Jose Annam, printed In
Frankfurt In 1568, Is the earliest picture
of papermaking In Europe. It shows
the remarkable similarity of the tools
and processes used by European
papermakers to those employed
centuries earlier In China (see particularly
photos pages 4 and 5). Illustration

Dard Hunter, Mountain House, 1923.

### 52730: China's new discoveries of ancient treasures

Since the 'Cultural Revolution'
China's new discoveries
of ancient treasures
1972 marks an important date in Chinese publishing, for it is during
this year (which happens to be International Book Year) that, for the
first time since the beginning of the "Cultural Revolution", books
on ancient art, archaeology, etc., have begun to re-appear in China.
Among these books have been a number of magnificent albums, lavishly
illustrated both in colour and in black and white, in which are presented
the rich findings of campaigns of archaeological research carried
out in the People's Republic of China since 1968. Our cover photo and
the photos reproduced in the following pages are a selection from
two of these books: "Archaeological Discoveries during the Great
Cultural Revolution" (Cultural Objects Press, Peking, July 1972), and
"Historical Relics Unearthed in New China" (Foreign Languages Press,
Peking, July 1972). These pages focus attention on one of the great
archaeological discoveries of recent years the unearthing of a Han
Dynasty tomb dating back some 2,000 years and containing treasures
of inestimable value, including astounding mailcoats made of jade
and gold, the burial garments of a prince and princess. An exhibition
of these recently-discovered treasures will be held in Paris early in 1 973.

IN the course of the past
few years Chinese archaeologists have
been carrying out extensive excava¬
tions in different parts of China as a
result of which a large number of
ancient sites and tombs have been
unearthed containing many precious
antiquities.
An exhibition of some of these new
archaeological discoveries was recent¬
ly held in Peking. It displayed about
2,000 objects, dating mostly from bet¬
ween the 20th century B.C. and the
15th century A.D. This was only a
sampling of the archaeological treas¬
ures discovered. In Shensi province
alone, for instance, 160,000 objects
have been unearthed, many of them
unique or extremely rare.
In the summer of 1968 two royal
tombs, burial places of a prince and
princess of the Western Han dynasty,
were discovered at Man-ch'eng, in
Hopei province. Hewn from the solid
rock of a 600 ft. limestone hill, the
tombs were those of Liu Sheng (who
died in 1 13 B.C.) and his wife Tou Wan.
Liu Sheng, ninth son of the fourth Han
emperor Ching-ti had been named
King Ching of Ch'ung-shan. Tou Wan
is said to have been the great-niece
of the Dowager Empress Tou, mother
of the Emperor Ching-ti.
Liu Sheng's tomb is 52 metres long,
37 m. wide and over 7 m. high (115 by
112 ft. and over 20 ft. high), with a
total volume of 2,700 cubic metres.
His wife's tomb has an even larger
volume: 3,000 cubic metres. Built on
the scale of a vast palace, each could
have held 1,000 people.
The tombs contained over 2,800
objects made of gold, silver, bronze,
stone, jade, iron, lacquer and silk;
in one was a stable with carriages,
horses and full harness.
The most exciting finds and the
first of their kind unearthed up until
now were the two funerary vest¬
ments of the prince and the princess,
each composed of over 2,000 rectan¬
gles of jade, perforated at the four
corners and linked together with fine
gold wire (see centre colour pages
and caption on page 18).
These jade "mailcoats", Chinese
counterparts, as it were, to the sarco¬
phagi of Egyptian mummies, were used
to enshroud the bodies of emperors
and high-ranking nobles under the
Han dynasty. Sewn with gold, silver
or bronze wire according to rank, they
were supposed to keep the remains
perfectly preserved. By the time the
excavations were carried out, the
bodies had of course long since disin¬
tegrated, and some of the jade plates
and their golden threads had been
broken.
The mailcoats have now been
completely restored. Liu Sheng's is
made up of 2,690 pieces of jade and
1,100 grams of gold wire. His wife's
mailcoat has 2,156 pieces of jade and
contains over 700 grams of gold wire.
An artistic achievement of the highest
order, they would take a skilled jade
craftsman of today at least ten
years to fashion.
Many of the objects from the tombs
are strange and lovely. There is the
Po-shan-lu incense burner, wrought in
bronze with gold and silver inlays.
The conical lid represents the moun¬
tainous island of Po-shan. Half-
hidden among the rocks and peaks,
are scenes with huntsmen and animals
picked out with minutely fine gold fili¬
gree work.
The lid is pierced with tiny holes
through which wisps of incense smoke
rose and drifted. In this way, the
craftsman symbolized the Po-shan
mountain perpetually shrouded in
mist.
Another fine and Indeed unique
example is the large (48 cm. or 19 in.)
gilt bronze lamp from the Ch'ang-hsin
Palace (see cover photo) which con¬
sists of a lantern held by a kneeling
court servant, on whose left arm can be
read the inscription "Ch'ang-hsin"
(eternal fidelity).
This palace was the residence of
the Dowager Empress Tou, who prob¬
ably gave the lamp to her great-
niece as part of her dowry. The whole
lamp can be taken to pieces, and the
woman's head is detachable. The
moveable base allows the direction of
the light to be altered at will; and an

adjustable shutter permitted the inten¬
sity of the light to be varied.
In October 1970, two enormous terra¬
cotta jars were found in a cave dating
from the T'ang dynasty (618-907 A.D.)
in the southern suburbs of Sian, in
Shensi province. They contained a
thousand objects in perfect condition,
including gold-worked vessels contain¬
ing cinnabar, amber, coral, amethysts,
chalk-stones, etc., as well as alchem¬
ists' materials such as agate mortars,
silver pots in the form of pomegra¬
nates, etc. All these came from
the mansion of an aristocrat and high
official about the middle of the T'ang
dynasty.
The dominant class was then torn
by internal strife. The officers of the
frontier guard had mutinied and seized
control of the capital, Shang-an (today
Sian). Before fleeing, the Emperor
Hsiian-Tsang and his ministers had
their treasures buried. The two jars
held over 200 pieces of gold and silver
plate, an unprecedented discovery.
According to ancient chronicles, the
Emperor Hsüan-Tsang was not only a
great drinker but also a great lover
of horses and equestrian displays. To
celebrate his birthday he would hold
sumptuous feasts, during which horses
danced with cups between their teeth,
to ceremonial music.
Later, these "dancers" became cav¬
alry horses. During the mutiny, when
they heard the same tunes, they
started to prance about in time to the
music. The soldiers thought they were
possessed by devils, and slaughtered
them. One of these dancinq horses
decorates a silver ewer found among
the hidden treasures.
Other outstanding finds are the
"six-petalled" or "lotus" bowls. They
include octagonal cups, dishes, in
the form of peaches, and amphoras,
all works of remarkable beauty. Many
of them are decorated with graceful
embossed, modelled, traced, stippled
or openwork motifs.
The designs are often enhanced by
grained backgrounds in low relief; in
the silverware the main motifs are
nearly always gilded. According to the
style of the period, these generally

figures in this farming scene to overlap the
frame. Above It, he has carved a
frieze of growing crops.

CHINESE
PEGASUS
Caught by the sculptor
in all the power and
poetry of the gallop, this
bronze charger Is so
delicately balanced that
it seems, like some eastern
Pegasus, to be almost
airborne. Found at
Wou-wei In the province
of Kan-su, it dates from
the Eastern Han Dynasty
(25-220 A.D.).
CHINA'S TREASURES (Continued from page 14)

represent flowers, hunting scenes or
animals (lion, fox, horse, bear, phoenix,
parrot, mandarin duck, tortoise, etc.).
Two octagonal cups with handles
have low-relief figures of musicians
and dancers on each of their eight
sides. The even, clear-cut tooling
seems to confirm the use of elemen¬
tary lathes.
These new excavations have
brought to light, among other things,
a Byzantine gold coin of Heraclius
(610-641 A.D.), a Persian silver coin
of Khosrô II (590-627 A.D.) and five
Japanese pieces (Wadokaiho) minted
in 708 A.D. These coins show that
China was trading with other coun¬
tries at that time.
In the region of Turfan (Sinkiang),
silk and hempen fabrics dating from
the T'ang dynasty have been found.
With their close texture, iridescent
colours and flower or bird designs,
these materials show the quality of the
textiles made in China in those early
days. Under the dynasty of the Eas
tern Han (25-220 A.D.), Sinkiang was
already the main channel for trade
between China and the outside world.
It was along this famous "Silk Road"
that most of the T'ang silks were ex¬
ported. And the pieces of silk and
hempen cloth discovered along this
route bear eloquent testimony to the
long history of commercial and cultural
exchanges between China and the
countries of Western Asia and even
Europe.
It was also in this region that a
volume of the "Confucian Analects
annotated by Ch'eng-Hsüan" was dis¬
covered. This copy, made in 710 A.D.
by Pu Tien-shou, then only 12 years
old, takes the form of a scroll 5 metres
(over 16 ft.) long. It is the oldest manu¬
script of this edition that has been
found so far. It dates back two cen¬
turies earlier than the one recovered
from the Tun-huang caves, and is more
complete.
In the Tsou-hsien district of the pro¬
vince of Shantung, excavations have
brought to light jars and stone tools
belonging to primitive Chinese sett¬
lements, and also a 14th century
Ming dynasty tomb containing artist's
brushes, ink tablets, inkpots and paper,
sets of Chinese chessmen and a zither.
Also found in this tomb were paintings
and works of calligraphy including a
fan with a poem by the southern Sung
Emperor Chao Kou (1107-1187) and
twenty-two books printed during the
Yuan dynasty of the 13th and 14th
centuries.
From the Ching-shan district in
Hopei province have come a series
of bronzes dating from the last period
of the Western Chou (11th to 8th cen¬
turies B.C.), and from the Chiangling
district twenty-five "chings" a kind
of stone xylophone from the Kingdom
of Ch'u (475-221 B.C.).
These "chings" are gracefully and
delicately decorated with phoenixes
and other coloured motifs. When
played, they still produce well-pitched
and harmonious musical notes.

CULINARY IDEOGRAM
Bronze vessel for meat or other cooked dishes, discovered In the
province of Hu-nan. It was made In two pieces and the lid which
kept the food warm could be removed and inverted for use as a
serving dish. Known in Chinese as a "Tou" (pronounced "doe"), the
vessel is represented In writing by a character (below) which exactly
reproduces the shape.
a
Numerous "ying-yuan" gold pieces
from the Kingdom of Ch'u were found
in the Lpu-an and Fu-nan districts of
Anhui province. At Ch'ang-sha in
Hunan province, a bronze halberd and
another long-handled weapon, a par¬
tisan, were found intact, mounted on
lacquered wooden shafts, as well as
a pike with a cane handle. These
weapons date from the end of the
Spring and Autumn Period (5th cen¬
tury B.C.).
The objects discovered at Tsinan in
Shantung province include some twen¬
ty earthenware funerary statuettes
dating from the Western Han dynasty
and representing a circus show of that
period. Ranged around the sides are
a master of ceremonies, an orchestra
with seven musicians and seven spec¬
tators. In the centre there are six per¬
formers, each wearing a different cos¬
tume. Two of the performers are
dancers, the four others acrobats.
At Tatung in Shansi province, exca¬
vations have brought to light inkpots
and two carved stone stands, as well
as paintings on lacquered wood dating
from the Northern Wei dynasty (386-
534 A.D.). These may be panels from
a screen, as the bright colours and
clear outlines resemble the typical
pictorial art of the working people at
that time.
In Peking, an outer door of a watch-
tower of the Ho-yi-men gate has
been discovered, and also the ruins
of ancient dwellings. The city of
Peking has a long history. The Llao
or Khitan Tartars (916-1125) set up
their capital there, which they called
Yen-ching. Then it became the capital
of the Kin dynasty (1115-1234), under
name of Tsung-ching. The later Yuan
dynasty built a new town they called
Ta-tu in the north-east suburbs of the
old capital.
Research has enabled the size of
this Yuan capital to be estimated; and
it is understandable that Marco Polo,
who visited it in the second half of the
13th century, should have described
it as the largest city he had ever seen.
Tombs containing the skeletons of
sacrificial victims, dating from the time
of the Chang-yin Dynasty (16th to
11th centuries B.C.), were discovered
in 1966 and 1969, at Yi-tu in Shantung
province and at Ho-ma in Shansi.
In the Shantung tomb, the slave¬
owner lies surrounded by forty-eight
immolated slaves; the Shansi tomb
contains the remains of eighteen vic¬
tims, four of whom have iron collars
round their necks.
In 1969, the Han-chla granaries were
cleared at Loyang in Honan province.
Their construction was begun in 605
A.D. under the Suei dynasty (581-618) ;
and under the Sueis and the T'angs
they constituted a vast State silo.
The whole covers over 420,000
square metres (500,000 sq. yds.).
Inside the surrounding wall there are
400 circular and concentric trenches,
6 to 8 metres wide and 5 to 10 metres
deep (20 to 26 ft and 16 to 33 ft.).
The largest one could hold nearly

600 tons of grain ; and even today
decomposed millet seeds have been
found there.
When the Chinese People's Repub¬
lic was founded, it was decided that
the protection of historical remains
would form an integral part of the
scientific and cultural activities of the
nation. Archaeological institutes were
set up all over the country under the
direction of the Chinese Academy of
Science, and a great many archaeolo¬
gists were trained.
In 1961, the State Affairs Council
classed 180 places as protected cul¬
tural sites, including the caves of
Long-men (Honan), Tun-huang (Kansu)
and Yunkang (Shansi), and measures
were taken for their protection.
The Archaeological Research Insti¬
tute of the Chinese Academy of Scien¬
ces and teams of archaeologists from
the various provinces, municipalities
and autonomous regions have since
brought to light a large number of
antiquities.
When ancient objects are found
during building or farm work, they
are immediately handed over to the
State, and the appropriate authorities
are informed. In 1969, two peasants
from Tsao-chuang in Shantung pro¬
vince unearthed the official seal of
Han Linerh, a leader of the Red Ker¬
chief rebels formed in 1368 during the
peasants' revolt, before the fall of
the Yuan dynasty. They immediately
offered it to the Historical and Revolu¬
tionary Museum of China.
When levelling a field, a farmer in
the Sin ch'eng district of Honan dis¬
covered two bronze teapots weighing
together over 37 kilograms (80 lbs.)
one of them dating from the Spring
and Autumn Period, the other from that
of the Warring States (722-221 B.C.).
He duly turned his finds over to the
authorities.
Gold coins (97.5% pure) from the
Ch'u Kingdom were found by farm
workers in Anhui province and given
into the keeping of the State. In
February 1970, workers from the Ning-
hsiang district of Hunan were digging
the side of a hill when they unearthed
a jar containing over, 300 pieces of
finely worked jade. After discussing
their exciting discovery, they took the
jade to the Hunan Provincial Museum.
In this way, many precious historical
relics were finally brought to light
after thousands of years.
The tomb of Liu Sheng was discov¬
ered at Man-ch'eng by a unit of the
People's Army of Liberation stationed
in the area, and excavations were un¬
dertaken with the help of soldiers and
the local population. The tomb cham¬
bers had been buried underground to
a great depth and the entrance was
filled with pebbles cemented and
reinforced with iron. But the archae¬
ologists forced their way through
by clearing the terrain stone by
stone.

during the Great Cultural Revolution", Peking. 1972.
CHINESE MORALITY TALE (page 19)
Fragment of a morality tale of feudal times engraved and
painted in lacquer on a piece of wood measuring 81.5 cm.
(32 in) by 40.5 cm. (16 In.). Found in the Shan-Hsi province,
it dates from the Northern Wei Dynasty (386-534 A.D.).
BLACK CHARGER (page 20J
The Chinese have always been famous for their sculptures
and paintings of horses. This beautifully proportioned
statuette was found recently at Lo-Yang in the province
of Ho-nan in central China. It stands 66.8 cm. (27 in.)
high and dates from the Tang Dynasty (618-907 A.D.)
when Lo-Yang was the capital of China.
LEOPARD SLEEVE WEIGHTS (page 21)
These miniature masterpieces, only 3.5 cm (1 i in.) In height,
were found in the tomb of the princess Tou Wan (see
caption for pages 22, 23). In gilt bronze with the leopards'
spots Inlaid In silver, they date from the Han Dynasty and
served as sleeve weights for the flowing robes worn at
the time.
THE SHOW MUST GO ON (page 21)
This lively scene, in which two dancers and four acrobats
entertain seven spectators to the tunes of seven musicians
under the watchful eye of their conductor, is an interesting
example of early Chinese ceramic art Originally the scene
contained 22 figures, but one acrobat is missing. It was
found In 1969 at Chi-Nan, in the province of Shantung, and
dates from the Han Dynasty.
JADE BURIAL VESTMENTS FOR A PRINCE
AND PRINCESS (centre pages 22, 23)
The sumptuous jade and gold funerary vestments of
prince Liu Sheng and his wife princess Tou Wan were
the most spectacular Items discovered in 1968 in the
Man-ch'eng tombs (see article page 12 and photo
page 13), and are the first such objects ever found.
The prince's vestment (bottom of photo) was made up
of 2,690 polished jade discs sewn together with gold
wire; his wife's contained 2,156 discs. They confirm
descriptions found In old Chinese histories, such as
that in the "Hou-Han shu" (History of the Later Han)
which says: "Bodies of Emperors are to be burled in jade casings sewn with gold
wire; Imperial princes, first generation feudal lords, Imperial princesses use jade
casings sewn with silver wire; high nobility and sisters and aunts of Emperors used
bronze wire." Prince Liu Sheng became King Ching of Ch'ung-Shan and he and his
wife were no doubt therefore accorded the full privileges of gold wire upon their deaths.
BRONZE AND CERAMIC WINE VESSELS (page 24)
The first great flowering of Chinese art (apart from
prehistoric pottery) found its expression in the very ancient
bronze vessels of the Shang Dynasty (16th - 11th century
B.C.). The heavy, tripod, sacrificial, wine vessel (left of
photo), called a "chia", was found at Wen-hslen In the
province of He-nan. Bronze vessels of this period were
often ornamented with the "t'ao t'leh" ("the glutton"), a
mask motif representing a mythical monster with staring
eyes, a nose and horns, but who is always depicted without
a lower jaw. The bronze wine vessel (bottom right) with
four feet and a swing handle dates from the same period
and is called a "you". Top right, a delicate glazed ceramic
vase dating from the Northern Chi Dynasty (550-577 A.D.J.
PO-SHAN INCENSE-BURNER (page 25)
One of the most lovely of the treasures recovered from
the Man-ch'eng tombs Is this bronze Incense-burner with
its delicate gold and silver Inlays. According to ancient
Chinese legend, there was a mountain In the province of
Shantung named Po-shan where grew rare plants of
Immortality and other delicacies. Chinese art, particularly
of the Han period, contains many examples of Incense-
burners called Po-shan-lou. They represent the mountain
of Po-shan and Incense smoke escaping from holes, in their
lids portrays the clouds which perpetually shroud its summit.

GODS, EPICS AND HEROES. A four-century old book a combination of art album and
historical novel has just been published In the Unesco collection of Representative
Works. Surprisingly modern In style, it is the famous "Tovar Manuscript" with Its superb
water-colour Illustrations depicting Aztec epics, gods and heroes, copied in the 16th century from
ancient Indian paintings. In 1587, a Mexican Indian missionary. Father Juan de Tovar,
gathered the historical and legendary traditions of the Aztecs Into a single work. All trace of
the manuscript was lost between the 16th century and the 19th century, when It was re-discovered
by an English collector. The "Tovar Manuscript" has now been published by the Akademische
Druck und Verlaganstalt, at Graz (Austria). It presents a Spanish text prepared by the
French hlspanist, Prof. Jacques Lafaye, of the Sorbonne (from the original manuscript now
in the John Carter Brown Library of Brown University, in the U.S.A.), a French translation and
numerous notes and commentaries. Opposite, three of its illustrations. Bottom left, Quetzalcoatl,
the "plumed serpent", a major deity in the Mexican pantheon and the Aztec god of creation,
inventor of agriculture and patron of learning. His cape of feathers symbolizes the wings
of a butterfly, the form in which warriors journeyed to paradise. Bottom right, an eagle perched
on a cactus devours a bird. The painting recalls the legend of the sun god, Huitzilopochtli,
telling the Aztecs to build their capital at a spot where an eagle was devouring
a snake (an image from which Mexico's national emblem Is derived). Tenochtitlan, the Aztec
capital, is now buried under Mexico City. Footprints around the cactus roots symbolize
the Aztecs' search. At upper right of painting is the god's shield with five points
representing the divisions of space, and two arrows. Left, the same symbols figure In
the painting of Huitzilopochtli.

### 52731: Painted manuscripts of pre-Columbian America

Painted manuscripts
of pre-Columbian
America
HE existence of books
among the pre-Hispanic peoples of
America, the materials used and their
typology, is such a wide theme that
the three major cultures (Náhuatl,
Maya and Quechua) should really be
studied separately.
The Mexican, Maya and Peruvian
Indians discovered and cultivated
different "modes" of transmitting their
culture and ethics. Some of them
still amaze us with their plastic beauty
MIGUEL ANGEL ASTURIAS, one of today's
greatest novelists in the Spanish language,
was bom In Guatemala in 1899. In 1967, he
was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.
Three of his most important novels have
been translated into English: "The President"
(Victor Gollancz, London, 1963), "The Mulatta
and Mister Fly" (Harmondsworth-Penguin
Books, London, 1970) and "The Green Pope'
(Delacote Press, New York, 1971).
and their esoteric ingenuity, and in
them all we discern a fundamental
and even obsessive urge to preserve
and transmit through original forms
of writing the profound meaning of
man and the universe.
Unlike the African world in which
social and historical traditions are
handed down through an unbroken
chain of oral communications, in the
pre-Columbian world, especially the
Náhuatl and Maya cultures, writing
and its preservation acquired an
importance matched only among the
Egyptians and the Jews. It is the key
to the universe, the tool that unlocks
its hidden mechanism, the sure and
constant guide in the conflicts and
catastrophes of an evolving world.
For this reason writing became
something sacred and esoteric for the
pre-Hispanic peoples. Written signs,
writing materials and those who could
handle them were considered by the
people as being connected with the
divine. The writings themselves, in
their creation and their appearance,
had a magical character, closely linked
to cosmogonie conceptions.
That is why the various systems of
writing that evolved among peoples
with such a high level of technical
expertise bore no relation to practical
needs; they were symbols for the
sacred message concealed within.
We know that writing, its preser¬
vation and interpretation were the

sometimes they even were priests

### 52731: Painted manuscripts of pre-Columbian America

PAINTED MANUSCRIPTS (Continued)
In Moctezuma's "List of Tributes",
which contains a kind of "live" classi¬
fication of metals and materials dif¬
fering profoundly from our modern
ideas but corresponding perfectly to
Indian religious priorities, paper made
of amatl bark Is rated as highly as
quetzal feathers and pieces of jade.
It was very widely used, both in
religious ceremonies and for preparing
codices. Many types of ceremonial
vestments, ritual objects and orna¬
ments were made of amatl paper;
some were natural-coloured and others
were richly decorated with painted
designs or splashed with "hule",
another sacred material.
The images of the gods were
adorned with crowns, fans, banners
and garments of paper. For some
ceremonies the priests wore paper
suits called tilmatl, and In pouches of
this material, decorated with seashells
or painted to imitate ocelot skin, they
carried incense or copal. Prisoners
about to be sacrificed were dressed
in tilmatl and decked with other paper
ornaments. The women who took part
in the festivals in honour of Huit-
zilopochtli also wore paper garments
painted with fine black stripes.
The original religious significance
of these systems of transmitting cul¬
ture has been lost for ever. So instead
of comparing their characteristics in
the different Indian cultures, I shall

give some specific examples of the
special even unique importance of
the methods or "channels" used for
perpetuating the sacred explanations
of the universe, the divine stories of
kings and princes, which were the
heritage to which our ancestors clung
in the uncertainties of changing cir¬
cumstances.
The pre-Columbian peoples pos¬
sessed several systems of writing
(ideographic, calendric, pictographic,
numeral, phonetic) with which they
wrote on deerskins, stones, and strips
of amatl paper. In their eyes however,
the very fact of recording and of
keeping these records was of such
vital importance that their loss or
preservation was identified with the
destruction or continuity of the
universe.

As with the arts of gold and silver
and feather working, we do not know
when writing and books, for reasons
of technical facility, lost their purely
symbolic and priestly character and
began to have profane uses. But
throughout the history of the pre-
Columbian peoples there is always a
close relationship between their
vision of the cosmos and their style
of writing, between their sense of
existence and the words stored in
books and codices or on stones and
skins.
The oldest Náhuatl account of the
origin of the People of the Sun
mentions "an ancient tale told by old
men" and speaks of the arrival of the
ancient settlers In the mythical Ta-
moanchan, where the forebears of the
Aztecs lived. With them lived some

the same system, but placed the bars horizontally. Below left, a page from another Mixtee manuscript,

Left, detall from the "Codex Mendoza"
(a record of Aztec life commissioned
in 1541 by the Spanish Viceroy in Mexico)
listing different tributes paid by subject
peoples to the Aztec emperor Moctezuma.
It records in great detail, from left to right,
the name of each city identified by its
glyph, the form of tribute (birds, shields,
clothes, etc.) surmounted in some cases
by a symbol Indicating the quantity.

wise men who are described in the
native language as "knowers-of-things"
and "possessors-of-codices".
These interchangeable epithets are
remarkable in themselves, but the tale
which follows is even more interesting.
The wise men had arrived from the
Gulf Coast and one day they heard
the voice of their god telling them to
depart, taking with them the ancient
traditions and the art of the black
and red inks which they used for
writing on deerskin. The text says:
And there were the knowers-of-
[things.
The so-called possessors-of-codi-
[ces
The wise men then went away,
They took away the black and red
[inks,
The codices, the paintings,
They took away knowledge,
They took everything away with
[them,
The books and the songs
And the music of the flutes
The old Indian tale goes on to depict
the utter desolation in which the
ancient Nahuas were left. It is easy
to compare' this state of stunned
helplessness with the effect produced
by the Spanish Conquest. The Indian
text tells how the ancient Aztecs kept
on tormenting themselves with ques¬
tions:
Will the sun shine, will the day
[dawn?
Since they have gone away, since
[they have taken away
The black and red inks, the codices,
How will the earth and the city
[endure?
What will govern us?
What will guide us?
What will be the rule?
Where must one start from?
What can be the torch and the
[light?

We are obviously faced here with
a historical concept, a view of the
importance of tradition and of writings
closely linked and practically assimilat¬
ed to the ontological conceptions on
which the whole Indian way of life was
built.
In fact, in order to make sure that
the world will continue to exist and
that the loss of the instruments of
transmission does not bring about the
end of their lives and the destruction
of the universe, the ancient Nahuas
meet to reinvent or rediscover the old
knowledge and the old form of pre¬
serving the past, the life and essence
of their people.
As may be seen from the text below,
they are not concerned with the form
and various ways of recording the
past hence their infinite variety but
with the act of recording it so that its
remembrance may illuminate and give
coherence to a world filled with gods,
conflicts and doubts.
Then they invented the count of the
[fates,
The annals and the count of the
[years,
The book of dreams;
They recorded the sequence and
[course of events,
The time that passed
Under the lordship of the Toltecas,
The lordship of the Tepanecas,
The lordship of the Mexicas,
And all the lordships of the Chichi-
[mecas.

The book, realm
of many arts
HIISTORY has known count¬
less varieties of "books". They range
from the cuneiform tablets of Sumer,
papyri of ancient Egypt, Ceylonese
books on rectangularly cut palm
leaves, Japanese "butterfly" books,
parchment manuscripts containing
codes of antiquity and medieval folios
down to modern publications.
The book was born of a harmonious
union between the arts and technology.
It became and has remained the joint
work of artist and printer, a fruitful
synthesis of many crafts.
The first European printed books,
dating from the 15th century, combined
the qualities of the illustrated manu¬
script with the new contribution of the
printing and typographic crafts. Since
then the book has undergone a constant
process of renewal.
An individual creation of the author
who writes the text and of the artist
who chooses the type and draws the
illustrations and cover, the book in its
final form is also the combined product
of many persons publisher, printer,
bookbinder and manufacturers of

paper, colours and ink. And it will
continue to be so until photo-compo¬
sition and microfilms take over if they
ever really do.
As an expression of world culture
the book has a long history, but
though many attempts have been
made, a truly comprehensive study of
the book has yet to be written. The
history of the art of the book is not
the history of printing, of book illus¬
tration, of book-binding, or of typo¬
graphy. It is the history of a complex
ensemble, a synthesis of the work of
all who have contributed to the book's
development.
Comparing the creation of a book
with architecture, the French poet
Paul Valéry pointed out that a book's
structural composition obeys clearly
defined laws of proportion.
The effort to make the book a
"celebration", a triumph of man's
creative genius, found expression in
the first masterpiece of European
printing Gutenberg's Mainz Bible.
Without the artist this celebration
would have been inconceivable.
Gutenberg used clear black letter-
type disposed In beautifully pro¬
portioned columns which he embellish¬
ed with hand-inscribed ornamental
borders in red and gold, contrasting
dramatically with the severe order¬
liness of the type. This was the first
instance of an artist painting in colour
on the printed sheets of each indi¬
vidual book.
Soon after Gutenberg printed his
book, one of his former workmen,
Peter Schoeffer, introduced coloured,
engraved initials into the type-setting
of the Mainz Psalter (1457). This
experiment saw the artist entering
directly into the printing process.
Other developments followed. Etch¬
ing on copper was tried, for example
in Dante's books published in 1481,
and attempts were also made to insert
primitive woodcuts as in the case of
Ulrich Boner's "Edelstein" in 1461.
By the end of the 15th century, books
were printed containing so many
engravings that the same engraving
was often repeated with different
captions, making these works the
negation of all that a book should be.
Progress in printing was fairly rapid,
so that when Aldo Manutius published
"Hypnerotomachia", at the turn of the
16th century, the book acquired the
form it has essentially retained to this
day. In this publication the artist
illustrated the text with linear woodcuts
and the printer produced it in carefully
selected Roman type disposed accord¬
ing to strictly defined laws of type¬
setting. Artist and craftsman joined
forces to create a harmonious
ensemble.
Along with woodcuts, copper
etchings were introduced in books
printed in the 16th and 17th centuries.
Since these etchings required different
techniques and equipment from those

Facsimile of a page of the 1456 Gutenberg Bible, the
first masterpiece of European typography with its strictly
yet beautifully proportioned columns of type. The lay¬
out and design of the characters owed much to the
traditions of medieval manuscripts which Gutenberg,
and other early European printers took as their model.

REALM OF MANY ARTS (Continued)
with which woodcuts were produced,
they were stuck into the books
separately. The magnificent etchings
inserted into the books of those days
were so numerous that all too often
they made the books look more like
albums or atlases.
A century later, sophisticated letter¬
ing and ornamental vignettes made
their appearance in many books. But
this was not the only trend. Caslon
and Baskerville in Britain, Didot in
£ ¿ France, and Bodoni in Italy introduced
j01 splendid new type styles, and William
S e Blake, poet, illustrator and printer
@o rolled into one, attempted to produce
oSa book that would be unique in every
1 1 feature.
In the 19th century, publishing
became an industry and a battlefield
of conflicting ideas. While the
Romantic poets were forging closer
links with artists, some writers came
to regard their prose as an explanatory
accompaniment to artists' drawings.
Charles Dickens' /Pickwick Papers"
began as an explanatory text to
Robert Seymour's drawings and he
was later to find another collaborator
in the artist Hablot Browne, "Phiz",
with whom he undertook a study of
the London slums.
The 19th century was also marked
by the emergence of masterpieces
of the new style of illustration. Adolf
Menzel adopted a scientific and histor¬
ical approach, while Gustave Doré's
passionate and dramatic style veered
towards the grandiose and the fan¬
tastic. But it was also at this time
that Gustave Flaubert began to protest
against illustrations in books of fiction
in general. He maintained, quite
rightly, that it was what was imagined
and hinted at, whether in a poem or a
psychological novel, that counted most
for both the writer and the reader.
Photography was yet another
development that was taken up by
printers and publishers during the
19th century.
Of vital importance in the history
of the art of the book were the new
possibilities . opened up during the
20th century by the invention of
mechanical type-setting, rotary print¬
ing, photographic techniques, zinco¬
graphy, intaglio printing in colour and
facsimile phototype reproduction.
The progress made in the art of the
book in the 20th century has been the
subject of several studies which
expound the now world famous art
nouveau of Aubrey Beardsley in Brit¬
ain, and Félix Valloton and Théophile
Steinlen in France, and the ¡ugendstil
of German artists.
At the beginning of this century,
the graphic arts and the art of the
book were becoming international in
character, a trend that was clearly
evident at the 1900 World Exposition
in Paris. It is, perhaps, no mere co¬
incidence that in this same year,
Ambroise Vollard, the famous patron
of "modern" artists, began publishing
high quality books including reprints

### 52767: The Book, realm of many arts

of works by authors of ancient times
and 19th century poets.
The appearance of luxurious publi¬
cations intended for a handful of
booklovers in many countries was
characteristic of this period, just as
was the contradictory phenomenon of
the spread of a completely different
type of book influenced by futurists,
dadaists and the Weimar Bauhaus
whose chief exponents were the
Russian El Lissitsky (see page 34) and
the Hungarian Moholy Nagy. These
publications appeared for the first
time after the first World War and
the October revolution in Russia.
II T is fascinating to trace the
main trends which gave shape to the
art of the book at the beginning of the
20th century and to study the ten¬
dencies that were common to various
countries.
Innovation was the first character¬
istic. Newly-coined words, new slo¬
gans and ideas produced in the melting
pot of world war and revolution had
immediate influence on the countries
of Europe and later spread to the rest
of the world. At the same time,
however, the book preserved with care
all that was best in the culture and
achievements of the past.
Constructivism was another contem¬
porary movement in which the balance
was maintained between innovation
and wisely selected traditions in book
production. It had little in common
with, the futurism of Marinetti, for
example, or others in whose books
the text was set in whimsically curv¬
ed lines to imitate the explosion of
bombs or shells while the text itself
evoked the whine and thunder of
exploding missiles. Russian futurist
book designers, meanwhile, were
experimenting with lines interspersed
with lithographs and texts printed in
block letters or even typewritten.
During the 1920s, functional cons¬
tructivism dominated and "art" and
"ornament" in books gave way to the
"structural" design of the printed
page; pages were set in types of dif¬
ferent sizes and letters in red were
scattered among the black type. The
tone was set by "The New Typogra¬
phy", a book published in German by
the Czech engineer Ian Tschihold.
One of the most brilliant exponents
of this tendency was the Russian artist
El Lissitsky who worked with success
in the Soviet Union and Germany. Also
in the U.S.S.R., Alexander Rodchenko,
who designed many books by Maya-
kovsky, broke away from the classical
rules of earlier aesthetics replacing
elaborate drawings with simple photo¬
montages. Later, another Soviet artist,
S. Telingater, combined Lissitsky's
pure "structuralism" and Rodchenko's
photo-montages.
In general, books published at this
time are notable for the vivid colours

MR. PICKWICK IN CHASE OF HIS HAT. "The Posthumous Papers
of the Pickwick Club" are a classic example of the interplay of text and
Image and of collaboration between artist and writer. At the outset,
Dickens' text was written to accompany the humorous drawings of
Seymour, such as that above; later, particularly when the young artist
H. Browne, "Phiz", took over from Seymour, the work of writer and
artist became inextricably interlinked to provide a rich word and image
portrait of 19th century England.
In this illustration for one of Pushkin's four "Malenkle Tragedii" ("Little QQ
Tragedies"), the Soviet artist V. Favorsky attempts to carry the reader JJ
deeper into the world of "evil passions" evoked by the poet.

A revolution in modern typography
i^B
Hi
A powerful current of new
ideas in literature, the arts
and graphic design surged
through Europe shortly after
the first World War. Numer¬
ous schools or styles, some
short-lived, others more en¬
during, sprang up. Their new
concepts and original works
challenged and radically trans¬
formed long accepted prin¬
ciples of taste and art. One
man who played a pioneering
role in spreading the new art
forms throughout western
Europe was the Soviet artist,
designer and architect El Lis¬
sitzky (1890-1941). In 1922,
El Lissitzky published a ten-
page children's book entitled
"Two Squares" . This book
(all its pages are reproduc¬
ed here in their original The 2 squares
colours) was a revolution in
modern typography. El Lis¬
sitzky had been influenced by
Kasimir Malevich. another
Soviet artist who founded a
movement called "Suprema-
tism", describing it as "the
supremacy of pure feeling or
perception in the pictorial
arts". As the illustrations of
his book show. El Lissitzky
repeatedly uses diagonal lines
and balanced, asymmetric typ¬
ography, techniques which
gave his pages a rhythm and
grace that modern display
advertising has since used to
great effect. In his "Notes on
Typography". El Lissitzky
commented on his book in
these terms: "For this story
of 'Two Squares' I endeav¬
oured to give form to an
elementary idea with ele¬
mentary means so as to stimu¬
late children to play actively ,

REALM OF MANY ARTS
(Continued from page 33)
used in their illustrations, though they
were still designed in traditional style.
Typical of this period is the set of
black and white illustrations (1923) by
M.V. Dobuzhinsky for "The White
Nights", by Fedor Dostoyevsky.
Nothing is so indicative of the div¬
ersity of the book as the revival and
almost universal success of books in
which the old woodcut technique is
used. Woodcuts by the great Russian
illustrator and artist Vladimir Favorsky
have won world-wide recognition as
significant works of art.
With consummate skill and intelli¬
gence Favorsky succeeded in reflect¬
ing in his woodcuts not only the con¬
tents of a book, but also its "inner
world", the author's hints and allu¬
sions, whose importance Gustave
Flaubert had stressed earlier. Favor¬
sky showed that artists can build a
new dimension into a book with
decorative techniques such as the
contrasting use of large and small
woodcuts.
This, of course, was not the only
trend. There are always books that
need traditional, colourful, vivid illus¬
trations. Such a book was Tolstoy's
"Anna Karenina" for which N.I. Pis-
karyov executed superb, lively colour¬
ed woodcuts. The book was publish¬
ed In the U.S.S.R. in 1933.
I,IN the 1930s, many of the
experiments of the previous decade
were abandoned and artists concen¬
trated on evolving illustrations that
gave' deeper insight into the psy¬
chology of the book's characters,
rejecting the play of lines and contours
for subtle half-tones of light and shade.
New techniques developed at this
time began to influence book design.
Offset printing was coming into its
own and it became possible to use
a variety of inks in any book.
Diagrams, plates and coloured illus¬
trations (such as those by Picasso
which were to make him famous)
began to be used which were no
longer integrally linked with the text.
The book seemed to split into two
parts, one literary, the other artistic.
Printed separately, these illustrations
were inserted into books.
For a time the "picture in a book"
style of design triumphed; splendid
water colours, realistic, abstract or
romantic drawings, cartoons and
landscapes accompanied the book
without being illustrations in the fullest
sense. The art of the book gave
way to "art in the book".
It was only in the mid 1950s and
early 1960s that an attempt was made
to seek unity in all the aspects of book
production. The new generation of
illustrators tended to demand personal
control over all the artistic aspects of
the book, from the dust cover to the
inside illustrations, second titles, end
pieces, etc. This calls for confident

TYPORTBÁIT OF A CROWD. If in the West
calligraphy is little more than an exercise for
children, this is not true of other parts of the
world. This is shown by the age-old writing
traditions of the East, not only In China (where
calligraphy Is one of the fine arts, equal in
stature to painting, sculpture etc.) but also
throughout the Arab and Moslem world.
Calllgraphy's links with modern typographical
design become evident In the work of the
young graphic artist Navendra, born in Delhi
in 1931. His experiments in adapting the

B"OTH the outward appearance
and the content of the book have changed considerably
through the ages.
The libraries of Antiquity at Nineveh, Nippur, Lagash
or Mari contained only stacks of "writing bricks"; the
Alexandria library, which was destroyed by fire, housed
mainly papyrus and leather, rolls. The Chinese wrote on
bones, wooden panels, bamboo strips and silk scrolls
before inventing paper.
The Ancient World was full of writings on stones
potsherds, or wax tablets before papyrus and parchment
were used, while paper is of relatively recent date. It was
only at the beginning of the Christian era that the scroll
was replaced by the "codex" of folded sheets bound
together to produce what we ordinarily term a "book".
Today the use of new materials and techniques has
vastly widened this over-narrow conception of the book.
Yet whatever the technique employed and the material on
which they are reproduced, text and image remain the
basis of visual communication. What concerns us here is
the relationship between them.
Western writing cannot be confounded with concrete
images since it uses abstract signs arbitrarily selected to
indicate sounds. This dual system was used on the walls
of prehistoric caves (A) even earlier than the development
of writing.
Endless efforts have been made to achieve the impossible
union of opposites, the superposition of text and image
merging into an essentially lyrical whole. Reading such
a complex image is rather reading a "mándala".
The Hindu and Buddhist mándala JJndia, Japan, Tibet and
elsewhere) is read like a plan; and many temples at
Khajuraho, Angkor and Borobudur, for instance are
concrete realizations of such plans. The mándala is a very
highly structured image for meditation (a series of concen¬
tric circles in squares), which leads the contemplator step
by step into the heart of his meditation.
And so it is rather in the style of a mándala that the
illuminator of the Book of Keils (B) hides the key words
under a wealth of decoration, that Rabanus Maurus (C)
reveals figures hidden in the text by the use of contrasting
black and red print, that Arab calligraphers give form to the
spoken word (D), that Apollinaire lays out his poems in the

shape of the objects he is writing about and that the com¬
puter (E) prints out In letters the various tones of a photo¬
graph it is scanning.
Between the two extremes of the illuminator's work "all
done by hand" and the computer's entirely "machine-made"
product, there are the various methods of reproduction
offered by the printing process: conversion of manuscript
into typographical characters (C) or, later, photographic
"facsimiles" of letters stuck on the invisible outline of
a drawing. These "text-images" indicate one extreme of
the relationship between text and image; another extreme
is revealed in the "text and environment-image".
Fully urbanized modem man lives in the heart of a vast
information centre in which text and image play an important
part. We need think only of the street (H) with its posters
of all sizes, rooftop signs, giant figures, window displays
and flashing lights; the hurly-burly of free commercial
competition throws together the most motley collection of
styles, qualities and interests. This kaleidoscopic environ¬
ment is the reflection of the modern world and foreshadows
the world of the future made of dreams, desires and myths,
with advertising programming the slogans.
An equally striking environment can be found centuries
away in time, in the tombs of the ancient Egyptians (F).
The scenes from the lives of the gods and from everyday
life, painted at great cost during their lifetime, are, for the
inner eye of the dead, a necessary accompaniment for their
new life. The hieroglyphics between the friezes are for¬
mulas of intercession. The Book of the Dead (G) merely
gives a summarized view of this environment.

### 52769: An 'A B C' of text plus image

ABC OF TEXT PLUS IMAGE (Continued)
The image is often separated from the text and their rela¬
tionship largely depends on the length of the text. The
custom of official inscriptions gives the characters and
lettering a monumental quality so that, even though unread,
they are regarded as a statement of some importance.
The Assyrian inscription (I) is overprinted on part of the
image, rather like the sub-titles dubbing foreign films. These
texts, carved in stone in defiance of time, tell their version
of history. Monuments erected by princes to commemorate
their conquests may be standing stones, writing carved on
rocks, pillars, triumphal arches all expressions of the
need felt in all ages to leave a landmark and a record.
Like these ancient records, the African trade signs contri¬
bute in their own way (J) to the exaltation of text and image.
And nowadays credit titles (K) projected on the cinema
screen before a film become like frontispieces, those lit¬
erary triumphal arches, that preface books of any impor¬
tance.
The text of the caption beneath or alongside the picture is
smaller in size and more familiar in tone, though still far
removed from the detailed "confidences" of the book.
In contemporary advertisements such texts are slanted
to guide the reader (N) and give the key to the pictures.
Even on Greek vases (L) this was so; apart from the signa¬
ture, praises and dedications personalizing a gift, the pur¬
pose of the text is to explain who the personages depicted
are. An ordinary scene from everyday life suddenly be¬
comes an episode from mythology.
Such means of. identification have been used right
through the centuries from Byzantium (M) to the Renais¬
sance and even long after in popular imagery.
On Greek vases the text is inscribed close to the figures,
but the circular structure of the image (as on Greek or
Chinese scrolls) does not limit the artist so strictly to two-
dimensional space as does the square or rectangular page
of the codex. For this reason there is a kind of free en¬
counter between text and ¡mage.
The desire for rationalization or for a division of labour
(between copywriter and illustrator) entails enclosing the
text in a frame (G), but the portrayal of the type of support
material for the writing, scroll (O) or book, may determine
the exact positioning of the text. This is so with the repre¬
sentation of the scrolls of the Prophets in the whole Judaeo-
Christian iconography.
Through a logical series of intermediary stages, these
texts which exemplify the Word, are placed closer and
closer to the mouth of the speaker. On manuscripts (P),
at the time of the birth of the theatre in the .early 13th
century, and in the first printed works (Q) we begin to find
texts in the pictures which are visualizations of speech and
valuable memory aids for improvised public "readings".
The standard book of Western civilization, having become
an intellectual working tool, discarded its illustrations.
Furthermore, methods of reproducing illustrations made
them completely independent of the text.
The popularization of books in the 19th century encour¬
aged printers to invent simpler processes of illustration.
Of these, wood engraving (R) made it possible to include so
many pictures that the book sometimes came to resemble
the picture storybooks (S) of popular literature. The text
set out in captions under the drawings provides an abridged
version of stories to be told to while away an evening.
In the book, skilful typesetting arranged the text round
the illustration, thus creating a kind of visual punctuation
which restored some of the freedom in lay-out that charac¬
terizes the old manuscripts. The strip cartoon (T) uses

Compostella, Spain, with

the distinctive sign of the
prophets.

ABC OF TEXT PLUS IMAGE (Continued)
the two systems of text in pictures and pictures in the
text, sometimes both together.
Part of the difficulty of the text-image relationship arises
from the fact that typography accentuates the arbitrary
nature of character design.
The "codex" form also contributes to these difficulties.
Calligraphers (U) tracing letters and drawings with thé
same hand and the same implement maintain a certain
respect for uniformity.
Western calligraphers are at a disadvantage compared
with their Chinese or Japanese counterparts, whose task
is facilitated by a more fluid and expressive writing.
Any writer-poet, any inventor making notes, anyone wri¬
ting a letter is experimenting with the powerful graphic
medium. But some, like Leonardo da Vinci (W) or
Tagore (X) for example, try spontaneously to link drawing
with writing. Then another more complex adventure starts
all over again the one whose paths we have tried to trace
in broad outline from the earliest writings to the annotated
drawings of Matisse (Y), or from Babylonian bas-reliefs to
Ethiopian paintings (V) and contemporary Japanese comic
strips (Z).

(Continued from page 35)
mastery of the whole range of graphic
art, enabling the designer to see a
book as a whole, with an imaginative
structure corresponding both to the
spirit of the text and the demands of
modern aesthetics.
A technique frequently adopted by
modern book designers is the
extensive use of colour, by the
introduction, for example, of black or
red pages on which the text is printed
in white. Printing part of the text,
separate words, or parts of a word
in bright colours has nothing in com¬
mon with the coloured initials and orna¬
mentations in ancient books, and the
same holds for the striking light and
black shades favoured in modern
engravings.
The new approach differs from the
old, purely decorative technique
because now the artist introduces
colour to emphasize shades of mean¬
ing in the text or to enhance the
atmosphere of a passage, thus making
the book more vivid and expressive.
A.D. Goncharov used this technique
in producing a new edition of Alexan¬
der Block's poem "The Twelve". The
poem is about the first days of the
1917 revolution in Russia and the
artist, feeling that black and white
illustrations would be inadequate to
convey the dramatic spirit of the
revolution and the burst of enthusiasm
it aroused, introduced illustrations in
the symbolic red of the revolutionary
banner. He used "grotesque" type
which seemed best to suit the poem.
The pages of the book are not all
white; some are red or black with the
text printed in white type. One page
is grey, and the white of the snow
falling on the dead body of a woman
pictured there is made whiter still.
Nevertheless, Goncharov only employ¬
ed fairly simple polygraphic tech¬
niques.
The Soviet artist Dmitri S. Bisti
gave appropriate treatment to Maya-
kovsky's poem "Lenin". The simplicity
of the uncompromising combination of
red and black that he used in his own
way makes Mayakovsky's words stand
out with even greater emphasis.
Indeed, the complete fusion of colour
with graphics, and of illustrations
against white margins, suggests further
striking possibilities in book design.
In the field of fairy stories and
children's books, to which publishers
have always paid particular attention,
joyful, full-bodied colour really comes
into its own. For the student of modern
book design children's books and art
books provide a rich and fascinating
subject of study.
Another, comparatively recent, phen¬
omenon which should not be over¬
looked is the increasing output of
books on science, technology and
science fiction which now compete
with traditional literature in numbers
of titles published and copies sold.
It was inevitable that this consequence
of the scientific and technological
revolution should open a new chapter
in the history of the book, leading to
the use of new designs and motifs
inspired by scientific discoveries.
OLLOWING the two dev¬
astating world wars of this century,
artists not generally regarded as
specialists in the field became in¬
terested in book illustration. The work
of Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse and
Rockwell Kent, Guillaume Appolli-
naire's calligrams, the "typoetry" of
Reinhard Döhl, Vercors' colour printing
and the high artistic quality of the Skira
publishers in Switzerland, have intro¬
duced such a variety, such a conflict
of ideas into the modern book that one
longs for the establishment of an
international centre which would record
and study new developments and pro¬
mote the international exchange of
ideas.
Created by the artist, the graphic
art of the book is one of the prime
elements of culture. In the wake of
the writer, the graphic artist re-creates
the past and records the present.
The images evoked create a dialogue
with contemporary man, becoming part
of his life, his thoughts and his
emotions.
Throughout the centuries books
have provided a distillation of each
different national culture with its parti¬
cular aesthetic and moral ideals. Yet
the process of research and creation
is never complete. Despite all the il
achievements of the past new 'rl
discoveries lie ahead. <

by burning the historical records which
mentioned other peoples and by
manipulating the codices so as to
establish for his people the people
chosen by the gods a past which
would provide a model for its future.
This is one reason not the most
improbable for the dearth of Maya
texts and the abundance of Náhuatl
writings. The Spanish Conquest and
the destruction that ensued (the
Council of Lima in 1583 proclaimed
the "tabula rasa" of provincial ar¬
chives) put an end to the various
systems of transmitting Indian culture.
A few missionaries, imbued with the
spirit of Renaissance humanism and
interested in "Indian antiquities",
discovered and expounded the nature
and ways of conserving the doctrines
and events of the past. It is almost
exclusively through their works that
something of the great pre-Hispanic
fervour for books and tradition has
come down to us.
In the final phase of the Mexican
tragedy, when the first twelve Catholic
missionaries arrive In 1524 to convert
the vanquished, there is a scene
highly significant of the importance of
the codices in the pre-Columbian
world. The missionaries attack the
Indian religion and way of thought and
at this point one of the Chiefs rises
to express "with courtesy and urban¬
ity" his displeasure af this attack on
the customs and beliefs so dear to his
ancestors. It is not for him to defend
them since there are still some
survivors of
Those who turn the rustling leaves
[of the codices,
Those who have in their power the
[black and red inks and the painting.
They lead us, guide us, show us
[the way.
They order how a year passes,
How it follows its course,
The account of the days
And each of the twenty-day months,
That is their business,
It is for them to speak of the
[gods . . .
There could be no more concise
description of the old Indian concep¬
tion nor any better expression of the
loneliness, sadness and helplessness
of a bewildered, leaderless people.
Neither is it surprising that the main .
purpose of the survivors should be
precisely to bequeath to posterity a
full undistorted picture of their history
and the characteristics of their culture.
This and the testimony of a few
missionaries are all that is left to us
after the cataclysm of the Conquest.
Despite everything the old custom of
fixing dates was maintained, although
now they commemorated only them ruin
of the Indian peoples, and we seem to
hear the revered voice of the Chilam
Balam de Chumayel lamenting:
Alas, my younger brothers,
Your cup will overflow with
[sorrow . . .
Prepare to bear the load of misery
That is coming to your peoples . . .
And today those fabulous codices,
whose ideographs have not yet been
deciphered, can still be seen in the
Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, In the
library of the Palais Bourbon, in the
Vatican, in Florence and Dresden,
testifying to the remarkable achieve¬
ments of the Amerindian peoples in
the production of wonderful books.

AZTEC DAY OF THE VULTURE
AND DAY OF THE RABBIT
With their rich colours and vivid drawings the illuminated
manuscripts of the Aztecs, of Mexico, rank high among the
finest artistic creations of pre-Columbian civilizations (see
article page 27). One of the most interesting of these manu¬
scripts is the Codex Borbonicus (named from the Palais
Bourbon, seat of the French National Assembly in Paris,
where it is preserved). A calendar drawn up for the purpose
of ritual and divination, it covers a strip of fibre paper
14 metres (46 ft) long, inscribed on both sides and folded
into accordion pleats to make a 38 page book. Each of the
first 20 pages covers a 13-day "week". Above, a page from
the manuscript showing a 13-day week beginning with
the Day of the Vulture (bottom left) and ending with the
Day of the Rabbit (top right). Divided into 20 units of 13 days,
the sacred year thus formed a 260-day cycle as compared
with the 365-day year of the Aztec civil calendar. Each day
in the sacred almanac is indicated by two squares in the
frieze, one for the day and the other for the night. The
presiding god of each day is shown with his own bird symbol
the eagle for the sun god, the owl for the god of death,
and so on.
large red dots. As shown here, the days and nights are laid
out in an inverted "L" shape so as to leave a large square
(here enclosed by a blue border symbolizing water). Within
the square are portrayed the presiding gods of the 13-day
week the sun god Tonatiuh (left) and Quetzalcoatl (right)
shown in his incarnation as the dog-headed Xolotl, wearing
a pectoral, "the jewel of the wind" in the form of a shell.
Inscriptions in Spanish were added during the early days of
the Spanish conquest.
