The Archangels and the Tarot
1995, collage (chalk, coloured pencils and ink, 70 x 50 cm)
by María-Luz Viaux
The Chilean artist María-Luz Viaux describes her work as
follows: "In my collages, my fears and joys are mingled.
My works feature Archangels, the perfect beings or
heavenly spirits who in Judaeo-Christian culture are sent
by God to solve the problems of humankind, and the
Moon, an astrological symbol in the Tarot cards which
originated in the Oriental tradition. Through fortune-telling
using the Tarot, which may have begun in ancient Egypt
5,000 years ago, some people still try to find relief from
their anxieties and a glimpse of the unknown future."

interview Javier Pérez de Cuéllar
\ m
Mr. Javier Pérez de Cuéllar,
former Secretary-General of the
United Nations, headed the
independent World Commission on
Culture and Development which
spent three years (1993-1995)
rethinking the notions of
development and culture and the
relationship between them. Here
he outlines the Commission's
approach to its task and sums up
some of the conclusions it reached.
Interview by Raj Isar.
The World Commission on Culture and
Development was the first group of
distinguished development economists, social
scientists, artists and policy-makers to reflect
together so intensively on the relationships
between culture and development. How does
its work take us forward?
Javier Pérez de Cuéllar: First, it shows how we
can and must broaden the notion of devel¬
opment itself. Development divorced from its
human or cultural context is growth without
a soul. And economic development in its full
flowering is part of a people's culture. In
these years of momentous change, which

offer people such unprecedented opportu¬
nities yet such unequal access to these
opportunities, it is particularly timely, it
seems to me, that this idea he asserted and
promoted internationally.
Because material measurements of "pro¬
gress" are no satisfactory index of human wel¬
fare, the search for other criteria has led, for
example, to the notion of human develop¬
ment, that measures improvements in a broad
array of capabilities, ranging from political,
economic and social freedom to individual
opportunities for being healthy, educated, and
creative and for enjoying self-respect and
human rights. Culture was implied in this
notion but it was not explicitly introduced. We
have shown why it must be introduced and
how it can be. This is an important step for¬
ward in rethinking development.
The second advance, it seems to me, is to
have transformed the way we look at the
pairing of the terms "culture" and "develop¬
ment". Is it simply culture and development?
Or is it culture in development? Culture for
development? Or development for culture?
Once you define culture as we have as
"ways of living together" and once devel¬
opment is seen as a process that enhances
the freedom of people everywhere to pursue
whatever goals they have reason to value,
then culture must be far more than just an
aspect or a means of development.
However important it may be as an instru¬
ment of development (or an obstacle to it),
culture should not be reduced to being a
mere promoter of (or impediment to) eco¬
nomic growth. Rather, it is the end and aim of
development when the latter is seen as the
flourishing of human existence as a whole.
The converse, which is the purely instru¬
mental view, was nicely characterized by one
scholar as the "add culture and stir" school.
I think many people expected the Commis¬
sion to at least inventory all the ingredients
that one might "add and stir" so as to
improve development programmes as cur
rently conceived, if not produre entirely new
recipes of its own!
Did you adopt that approach?
J. P. de C: We took a different tack. Human
beings value goods and services because of
what they contribute to our freedom to live
the way we value. And what we have reason
to value must itself be a matter of culture.
So while it has. far-reaching instrumental
functions in development, this cannot be all
there is to it. There is also the role of cul¬
ture as a desirable end in itself, as giving
meaning to our existence. This dual role
applies not only to the promotion of economic
growth but to other objectives, such as sus¬
taining the environment, enhancing social
cohesion or fostering civil institutions in a
society. Insofar as we have reason to value
these objectives, naturally we would value
the attitudes and behaviours that help us
attain them. But when we turn to the more
basic question why concentrate on these
objectives in the first place? culture has to
enter in a more fundamental way. Not as a
servant of ends, but as the social basis of the
ends themselves.
The third important step forward the
Commission has made, in my opinion, has
been to explore the myriad ways in which
cultural diversity is a strength, not a weak¬
ness; why there can be as many different ver¬
sions of development as there are cultures;
why we must find ways of allowing peoples
from every part of the planet to contribute
to "modernity" in their own terms; and why it
is vitally important to preserve our diverse
heritages in an era so rich in the potential for
...There is also the role of culture as a
desirable end in itself, as giving meaning

interview
even deeper mutual enrichment yet so
fraught with the menace of homogenization.
This is the basic message we sought to put
across in the title Our Creative Diversity
we chose for our report.
Once again, we offer no recipes. To dis¬
cuss culture today is to admit a multiplicity
of readings. Hence instead of tailor-made
solutions, we preferred to raise some of the
hard questions that people face, particularly
in the developing countries. How to deal
with the paradoxes of globalization? How to
find order and meaning in a world disorder
full of uncertainty, incoherence and injus¬
tice? How to claim a space for locally rooted
culture yet take part in shared, planetary
processes? How, in a word, to elaborate their
own models of development?
We take your point that there can be no
recipes. But what are your main messages?
J. P. de C: We decided to explore ten key
areas in which the interactions between cul¬
ture and development appeared particularly
acute or especially pertinent. In each case,
we focused on the challenges of diversity,
and the potential of human creativity.
Intolerance is particularly pernicious when it
is the policy of intolerant governments,
opening the door to discrimination,
segregation and exclusion.
As the globalization of markets, technology
and information sweeps the planet, the fear of
growing homogenization induces accelerating
fragmentation. People are brought closer
together; simultaneously, they are driven
apart. Bridges must be built between them.
What values can provide shared points of ref¬
erence, the minimal moral guidance the world
must heed? Many different sets of values
could enrich such common ground. We for
our part identified five principles: human
rights and responsibilities; democracy; the pro¬
tection of minorities; commitment to peaceful
conflict resolution and fair negotiation and the
promotion of equity.
What was your position on pluralism?
J. P. de C: We could not avoid reaffirming a
commitment to pluralism, as a basic tenet.
Not only as an ideal for relations between
nations but also within nations. How can
each nation create a sense of itself as a civic
community, freed from any connotations of
ethnic exclusivity?
We asked the question haunted by the
ethnic conflicts erupting across the world
even as we deliberated each one the bitter
harvest of diversity mismanaged or cynically
manipulated, with the terrible price innocent
people have had to pay and the consequent
rising tide of human despair and anger.
Surely the lesson of our terrible century is
clear by now: we must learn to rejoice at cul¬
tural differences and attempt to learn from
them.
Governments can hardly prescribe such
attitudes and behaviour as respect and
rejoicing, but they can prohibit attacks on
people from different cultures and their
practices, and they can set the legal stage for
mutual tolerance and accommodation. Intol¬
erance is particularly pernicious when it is
the policy of intolerant governments. Dis¬
crimination, segregation and exclusion based
on cultural traits then deny people their
basic cultural rights. In these cases strong

international pressures should be used to
denounce such policies and practices, as the
international community was able to do suc¬
cessfully in South Africa.
What is the role of democracy in this
context?
J. P. de C: The only way to achieve pluralism
that delivers equity as well as political sta¬
bility is to make society an inclusive whole,
extending opportunities to all groups. This
requires a democratic framework, consider¬
able decentralization of power and equal
access to institutions of justice. All of these
in turn require real creativity in governance.
The notion of creativity was a second leit¬
motiv for us, as the leaven of diversity. We
urged therefore that the idea of creativity be
more broadly applied to problem-solving in
every field. In the arts and cultural expres¬
sion, it is too often taken for granted in our
world of commodified culture, and its col¬
lective and participatory forms remain under¬
valued. We noted also that scientific and
technological knowledge, creatively adapted
to local circumstances, can be strongly
empowering.
The Commission devoted specific attention
to women and young people . . .
J. P. de C: Development is changing cultural
perceptions of women's and men's life cycles
as well as patterns of gender relations. It is
time to develop agendas which would avoid
the dual pitfalls of ethnocentrism and
Western bias on the one hand, and unprinci¬
pled forms of cultural relativism which deny
women their basic human rights in the name
of "difference", on the other. Hence it is
important, we think, to devise and apply
policies with regard to women's rights as
human rights; reproductive freedom; and to
gender-aware planning and civic and cul¬
tural participation.
How can wc construct a world in which
the defences of peace are built in young
minds? Young people today are better able
than their parents to appreciate the diversity
of values and forms of expression and are
generally more comfortable with technology.
Yet they must be helped to realize that no
culture can ever be thought to invalidate
another though it may often be able to
enrich it by new concepts, categories, and
insights. Our generation has a responsibility
to encourage positive exposure to both diver¬
sity and complexity.
Your recommendations are set forth in an
"International Agenda" that some people
appear to find over-ambitious.
J. P. de C: We designed our "International
Agenda" to be selective and illustrative, not
comprehensive. First and foremost, we wanted
it to deepen the analysis of culture and devel¬
opment. We wanted it to focus energies
around practical initiatives such as the inter¬
national mobilization of Cultural Heritage Vol¬
unteers and an international plan for gender
equality. We hoped it would lead to the emer¬
gence of an international consensus on the
core issues we raised, particularly through
the universal recognition of cultural rights,
and of the need to balance these rights with
responsibilities.
When we call for a reformed United
Nations that really represents "We the peo¬
ples of the United Nations", with a two-
chamber General Assembly, one with govern¬
ment representatives as at present, and the
other representing national civil society orga¬
nizations, we are perhaps even further away
from our goal than the visionaries who first
imagined a European union some seventy
years ago and were considered hopelessly
unrealistic at the time! But we have laboured
not only for our peers, but also for our chil¬
dren and our children's children. On the eve
of a new millennium, as my fellow Commis¬
sioner Celso Furtado has put it, "the chal¬
lenge we face is to conceive a new Utopia
without which the survival of humanity will
not be possible." I

### 104416: What is development?

What is
development?
Is it a soulless process of economic growth
dedicated exclusively to the creation of wealth
and regarding everything, including culture, as a
commodity? Or is it part of a broader endeavour
to construct a society whose members are both
participants and beneficiaries and whose goals are
not limited to economics but shaped by the
values to which these people subscribe?
These questions, which have long been
asked, were recently re-examined in depth
during a three-year enquiry (1993-1995) carried
out by a distinguished World Commission on
Culture and Development chaired by Mr. Javier
Pérez de Cuéllar. The Commission's overall
findings have recently been published by
UNESCO in the form of an excellent report
entitled Our Creative Diversity.
This issue of the UNESCO Courier is natu¬
rally more limited in scope than the Report. It is
an attempt, via contributions from some of
those who helped the World Commission in its
deliberations, to present this complex issue to a
wide public in simple terms. The conjunction of
two such disparate terms as development and
culture is in itself enough to give rise to misun¬
derstandings, false problems and false solutions,
and therefore invites caution.

A MATTER
OF
CHOICE
BY AMARTYA SEN
I he tree of life, a work
by the French artist
Niki de Saint Phalle. TI here are two ways of looking at
development in the contempo¬
rary world. One, deeply influ¬
enced by growth economics
and the values that underlie it,
regards development as essen¬
tially a rapid and sustained expansion of gross
national (or domestic) product per head, per¬
haps qualified by some requirement that the
fruits of this expansion reach all sections of
the community. I shall call this "the opulence
view of development." In this approach,
values and culture have no foundational place.
A second, contrasting view sees develop¬
ment as a process that enhances the freedom
of those involved to pursue whatever objec¬
tives they value. In this, which I shall call "the
effective freedom view of development", the
importance of economic opulence is left to
the values of the people involved, and is thus
culturally conditioned.
In line with this view of development, the
expansion of human capability may be
described as the central feature of develop¬
ment. The concept of a person's "capability"
can be traced back to Aristotle, for whom the
life of a person could be seen as a sequence of
things the person does, or states of being he
or she achieves, and which constitute a col¬
lection of "functionings". "Capability" refers
to the alternative combinations of function¬
ings from which a person can choose. Thus,
the notion of capability is essentially one of
freedom the range of options a person has
in deciding what kind of life to lead. Poverty,
in this view, lies not merely in the impover¬
ished state in which a person may actually
live, but also in the lack of real opportunity

imposed by social constraints as well as per¬
sonal circumstances to choose other types
of living. Even low incomes, meagre posses¬
sions, and other aspects of what are stan¬
dardly seen as economic poverty are relevant
ultimately because of their role in curtailing
capabilities (that is, in severely restricting
people's opportunities to lead valuable and
valued lives).
The application of this broader view of
development thus involves specific
hypotheses about the values people have
reason to cherish. Economists who have
studied this problem have been particularly
attentive to indicators of quality of life such as
longevity, good health, adequate nutrition, basic
education, absence of gender-based inequality,
and basic political and social freedoms.
This approach, which is based on people's

just for the help that it might
give to economic growth, but
because it is an essential part
of cultural development."

values, differs from the radical a priori judg¬
ment implicit in the "opulence" view of
development. If, given the choice, people
would rather have longer and more disease-
free lives with more autonomy rather than a
higher level of GNP per head, then the
"effective freedom" view of development
can be applied to their case, but not the "opu¬
lence" view of development.
In the opulence view of development, the
focus is uncompromisingly on the growth of
incomes. However, while classical economic
theorists from Adam Smith to John Stuart
Mill did indeed write a great deal on the
growth of real income per head, they saw
income as one of several different means to
important ends, and they discussed exten¬
sively the nature of these ends very dif¬
ferent as they are from income.

### 104417: A Matter of choice

Smith, Mill and other classical authors
were deeply concerned with the idea that we
value many things other than income and
wealth which relate to real opportunities to
lead the kind of life we would value living.
Their writings reveal great interest in the
foundational importance of our ability to do
the things we value, and have reason to value.
They commented fairly extensively on the
connection between these matters, on the
one hand, and income, wealth, and other eco¬
nomic circumstances, on the other, and they
had much to say on public policies that sup¬
port and promote the more basic ends on
which we may choose to concentrate.
Evaluating
economic growth
In the opulence view of development, the role
of culture is purely instrumental, helping in
particular to promote rapid economic growth.
The question thus arises as to whether eco¬
nomic growth can be valued for its own sake,
thus leading to the treasuring of those things
(including culture) that promote growth? Or
is economic growth itself an instrument, with
less claim to a foundational role than cultural
aspects of human life may have? It is hard to
think that people have good reason to value
goods and services irrespective of what they
do to our freedom to live in a way we would
value. It is also difficult to accept that culture
can have a purely instrumental role. Surely,
what we have reason to value must be itself a
matter of culture, and in this sense we cannot
reduce culture to a subsidiary position as a
mere promoter of economic growth. How
can we make our reasoned valuing completely
valueless?
It is thus important to acknowledge the far-
reaching instrumental functions of culture in
development but also to recognize that culture
cannot be reduced to these functions. Culture
also plays, for example, an intrinsic role in eval¬
uating the process of economic development,
as well as in making room for less immediate
objectives such as sustaining the environment
and preserving the diversity of species.
Some cultural parameters can help, and
others will hinder, the fulfilment of these
objectives, and we have grounds for valuing
those cultural attitudes and features that
foster this fulfilment. But when we turn to

without taking note of each of these two roles
of culture.
A foundational role
Since the language of "sustaining" has become
common in the literature of development, it
is not surprising that the phrase "culturally
sustainable development" has made its
appearance. Is this the right direction to take,
in moving away from a purely instrumental
view of culture in development?
There are two major drawbacks in using
language of this kind. First, it ignores the con¬
stitutive role of culture. If culture is only to
do the "sustaining", we still have to ask what
is to be sustained. Focusing on "culturally
sustainable development" is to alienate cul¬
ture from its foundational role in judging


development, and to treat it just as a means of
sustaining "development" no matter how
that is defined. This is, in other words, an

ornamental debasement of culture to the
status of a glorified instrument in sustaining
"development", defined independently.
The second problem comes from a dif¬
ferent direction. Culture admits of
dynamism, evolution and refinement. Cul¬
ture in every country in the world has
changed over the centuries. The rhetoric of
"sustaining" as opposed to having the
freedom to grow and develop frames the
cultural debate in prematurely conserva¬
tionist terms. There is a dis-analogy with the
environment, here. When it comes to the
natural environment, we don't try to
improve the best that nature gave us; we try
to "conserve" what we have got, and perhaps
return to what we had earlier. But culture is
the fountain of our creativity and progress.
Sustaining is too feeble a role for it to play in
development. Once we shift our attention
from the purely instrumental view of culture
and accept its constructive and creative role,
we have to sec development in terms that
include cultural development as well.
The three roles of culture
Culture comes into development in three
quite distinct though interrelated ways.
Constitutive role: Development in the
broadest sense includes cultural develop¬
ment. Cultural development is a basic and
inseparable component of development in
general. If people are deprived of the oppor¬
tunity to understand and cultivate their cre¬
ativity, then that in itself is a hindrance to
development (not just because it may hurt
economic growth, or some other externally
specified objective). Basic education is thus
important not just for the help that it might
give to economic growth, but because it is an
essential part of cultural development.
Evaluative role: What wc value is, ulti¬
mately, influençable by culture. There is no
externally sanctified importance to economic
growth or any other such objective, and the
things that we intrinsically value reflect the
impact of our culture. Even if the same things
are valued in many different societies (if, for
example, longer and happier lives without ill-
health are sought in many quite different
societies), this does not make them indepen¬
dent of values or cultures, but only indicates
the congruence of valuational reasons in dis¬
tinct societies.
Instrumental role: No matter what
objectives we value, their pursuit is to some
extent influenced by the nature of our cul¬
tures and ethics. While there is more to cul¬
ture than this, we must not ignore the fact that
cultural parameters do inter alia have strong
instrumental roles. This applies not merely to
the promotion of economic growth, but also
to the achievement of other objectives such
as raising the quality of life.
Central to culture is freedom, and in par¬
ticular, the freedom to decide what wc have
reason to value, and what lives wc have
reason to seek. The instrumental, the evalua¬
tive and the constructive roles of culture all
relate, ultimately, to this freedom.

or the first time in history, the
global market and telecommu¬
nications have brought people
of all the cultures of the world
into permanent contact. While
this is an astonishing historical
achievement, it is bringing both benefits and
liabilities. Better communications between
cultures may bring greater understanding, or
greater friction. Increased trade, conducted
in a just and equitable manner, may provide
more people with access to necessary prod¬
ucts and services; yet it may also wipe out
livelihoods and leave people destitute as
information on the new markets eludes
them. More technology increases our under¬
standing and capacity for managing the envi¬
ronment and our own genetic processes: yet
it may lead to the de-skilling of the cultures
in a "brave new world". The manner in
which these processes evolve will depend on
how people react to such new possibilities.
This is the reason why culture needs to be
made visible as the context in which societies
evolve. Development thinking and policies
must, as a matter of urgency, take up the
issues of co-operation, community, trust,
ethnicity and identity since these make up the
social fabric on which the polity and the
economy are based. In many parts of the
world, exclusive emphasis on competition
and the market are altering these sensitive
equilibrium factors and exacerbating cultural
tensions and feelings of uncertainty.
The way to situate oneself in the world
most readily is by enumerating the traits of
one's culture, which are best defined by
being set in contrast with those of other cul¬

enclosed within symbolically visible cultural
boundaries, although these are contextualized
in historically continuous cultural flows.

demography, as well as culturally expressive
collective rituals and ceremonies. This highly
centralized, mechanical scheme must now
open up to more flexible participative arrange¬
ments in which the realities of economic inter¬
dependence and cultural identities may be
incorporated.
Complex identities
The great battle today is between a humanist,
rational culture, which proposes respect for
all cultures and religions, and manichean cul¬
tures, which posit the intolerant imposition
of exclusive creeds.
The rational culture seeks political solutions
to today's eruption of entitlements (human,
national, bioethical, gender, ethnic and reli¬
gious) which involves a new co-evolutionary
vision that will lead to new agreements, reor¬
ganizing existing institutions and, in some
cases, building new ones. At the individual
level, it advocates multi-layered arrangements
of identities that will allow a person to recog¬
nize his or her place in the world simultane¬
ously as a planetary inhabitant, a citizen of a
nation-state, a gendered being, an affiliate of a
particular culture or several, according to
ancestry, geography or choice and a holder
of beliefs in a given religion.
The opposing cosmopolitical scheme
entails the enforced imposition on other
people of one's own cultural affiliation, polit¬
ical system or religious creed. Such a vision
may lead to successive killings since each vic¬
tory ensures that revenge will be sought by
the defeated party within a few years.
What is new in today's shifting of cultural
boundaries is that these are interwoven with
the political reorganization of the role of
nation-states on the global stage. Significantly,
new legislation, institutions and participation
mechanisms related to cultural pluralism con¬
stitute by their very nature proposals for new
political schemes to organize public life.
However, while creativity has brought
about a revolution in technology, communi¬
cations and the arts, it has barely touched
institutions and procedures of governance.
The transformation of institutions and the
search for civic ties to allow different groups
of people to live together are more urgent
than ever. They must be based on recognition
of the equal dignity of people and of their cul¬
tures. Experience has taught us that gover¬
nance that denies cultural identities leads to
barren tyranny, and culture without gover¬
nance leads to unmanageable conflict.

THEAGEOFTHE
MIGRANT ARTIST
BY MICHAEL HAERDTER
ur globalizing world seems to be
marked by rapidly increasing chaos,
I a profound crisis of the ideas of
order, coherence and limitation that
long prevailed and whose legend we
arc still addicted to. Linear systems
in the sciences are slowly giving way to what has been
labelled "chaos theory". A clear and calculable image
of the world is fading, and the ideas of national
integrity and coherence are increasingly revealed as
an illusion.
The traditional concept of separate cultures
based on ethnic homogeneity and national singularity
has become untenable, whether we like it or not.
Cultures today are in general characterized by
hybridization. Our lives are defined by more than
one culture of which our personalities are crossing
points. We have hyphenated identities, and our cen¬
tury might be seen as a "hyphenated" period whose
dramatic turning points and murderous climaxes
reveal the death-throes of one world and the birth-
pangs of another.
The ivory tower in which solitary artists strove
for transcendental purity has been abandoned. Post¬
modern artists have left their lonely studios and
returned to the marketplaces of the world. Instead of
creating timeless works of museum art, they com¬
municate ideas and emotions, often by provocative
concepts or irritating objects and installations. The
formalist master perfecting his style over a lifetime is
a model which has been replaced by that of the artist
capable of formally mastering an existential message
or situation at any moment of his or her life. Art
today is largely interventionist and temporary. It can
happen anywhere. The studio of the postmodern
artist is the world.
Migrating artists are among the many transcul-
tural messengers of a world whose keywords are
nomadism and globalism. The postmodern inven¬
tion and worldwide spreading of residential arts cen¬
tres are one response to the needs of artists and intel¬
lectuals to experience the world and its many envi¬
ronments and cultures, to be temporarily part of
creative communities and to exchange ideas and
knowhow. The networking of centres across
national and cultural barriers is part of the post¬
modern game, as is the crossing of borders between
arts and technologies that many of these centres are
able to provide.

X
INTERVIEW WITH JOHN L.ESPOSITO
The resurgence of religion is one of the
most powerful forces to have influenced
culture and development in recent times.
When did it start? In what parts of the world
is it prevalent?
John L. Esposito: Iran's Islamic revolution in 1978-
1979 threw light on a reassertion of Islam that had
been going on for more than a decade in some
Islamic countries. Since then Islam has re-
emerged as a major force in political and social
development. Certain movements have engaged
in campaigns of terror in attempts to destabilize or
overthrow governments. Moderate Islamists have
emerged as social and political activists, espousing
the re-islamization of society.
In Latin America, Catholic liberation theology
has informed attempts at social and political
reform. It emerged shortly after the Medellin con¬
ference of Catholic bishops in 1968, which
reflected the spirit of the Second Vatican Council,
and its message was re-emphasized at the 1979
conference of Catholic bishops at Puebla, with its
emphasis on Christianity's "preferential option for
the poor". It has been accompanied by greater
recognition of the role and participation of the laity
in the Church, and a greater emphasis on the rela¬
tionship of the Church to the world, in particular
to issues of justice and equality. In Eastern Europe,
Christian churches played a significant role in the
fall of communism and the emergence of a
democracy movement.
In Sri Lanka, conflict between Sinhalese (Bud¬
dhists) and Tamils (Hindus) has had devastating
consequences during the past decade. India, an
ostensibly secular state, has experienced multiple
communal conflicts, often motivated by the chal¬
lenge of religious nationalism. Clashes between
Muslims and Hindus at Avodhya, where Hindus
seized a mosque claiming it as an ancient Hindu
religious site, and conflict over family law have

heightened tensions between the two communi¬
ties. In the southern Philippines, militant Muslim
factions have agitated for autonomy from the
"Christian dominated" government. In the former
Soviet Union, emergent religious nationalism in
Central Asia is matched by new religio-political
impulses of the Russian Orthodox Church.
All these events remind us of the potential
force of religion in the developing world in partic¬
ular. They reveal the fragility of many nation-states
and the issues of identity and legitimacy that con¬
tribute to the vulnerability of many governments.
What forms do these movements take?
J. L. E.: Revivalist movements are communities
within communities. They view themselves as just
societies established within broader unjust soci¬
eties. They tend to be manifestations of popular
religion, that is, organizations that are born from
populist movements rather than from the official
or institutional church or clergy. These organiza¬
tions create a new religious consciousness and
sense of identity and mission. Religious beliefs and
rituals are reinterpreted to provide direction, as
the faithful combine their quest for happiness in
the next life with a determined effort to create a
better life in the here and now.
What are the causes of religious revivalism
in the developing world?
J. L. E.: The new and better world promised by
modernizing elites and development experts has
not materialized for many. The modern nation-
state with its secularism, consumerism and unfet¬
tered individualism has often produced societies
in which the needs of the majority are subordi¬
nated to those of a minority. Maldistribution of
wealth, corruption, unemployment and housing
shortages have become endemic. Modernization
and urbanization have resulted in overcrowded
cities, social dislocation and culture shock, urban
slums and barrios. of shattered expectations, a
breakdown of the family in the midst of the more
"permissive and foreign" ways of the city.
The development of non-Western countries
was based upon a theory of modernization that
equated development with the progressive west¬
ernization and secularization of society. Religion
tended to be regarded as a major hindrance to
political and social change. Science and technology
were seen as powerful handmaidens in this
process of secular development. However, not
only did modernization remain primarily the pre¬
serve of a small minority elite of society, but most
importantly, the secularization of processes and
institutions did not easily translate into the secu¬
larization of minds and culture.
'Injustice has driven many to their local place of worship where
the scripture is read and experienced as a message to their
hopeless or desperate situation.'
What is the basis of this religious revival?
J. L. E.: Generally speaking, its representatives claim
to offer a more authentic and religiously-based
society. They espouse themes of liberation, social
justice and equality, and project themselves as
champions of the poor and oppressed. Injustice has
driven many to their local mosques or churches
where the scripture is read and experienced as a
message to their hopeless or desperate situation. In
some countries, Islamic movements have provided
an alternative set of social welfare services. Similarly,
Catholic liberation theology has been essentially a
response to the plight of the poor.
So is this a kind of backlash by those who
have lost out from development, who are
turning their backs on the world and rejecting
modern technology and the communications
revolution?
J. L. E.: Most revivalists do not believe that they
are retreating. Many see themselves as reclaiming
the original message and guidance of their
prophets and scriptures, a message obscured with
the passage of time and the assault of modern sec¬
ularism. They fault or incriminate the impact not
only of colonialism but also of despotic govern¬
ments that came later, entrenched elites, and a
clergy that itself came to constitute an unrespon¬
sive religious establishment.
These movements have attracted educated
professionals teachers, engineers, lawyers, scien¬
tists and bureaucrats. Many of their leaders arc
graduates from faculties of medicine, science and
engineering, who have harnessed modern tech¬
nology radio, television, audio and vidéocas¬
settes, computers and fax machines to organize
and mobilize mass support and disseminate their
religious and socio-political message.
Thus technology and communications have
not simply been the purveyors of modern
Western, secular culture, but also of a revitalized
religious message. Villagers no longer live in rela¬
tively isolated worlds solely dependent upon their
local religious leaders. Television, radio and audio-
cassettes now expose them to a diversity of voices
and interpretations of faith and belief. Moderniza¬
tion has provided, perhaps unwittingly, a major
impetus for this global religious resurgence.

### 104434: The Resurgence of religion: interview with John L. Esposito

What could be done to open up
communication between secular modernists
and religious reformers? Is there any common
ground between them?



J. L. E.: Underestimation of the continued presence
and power of religion, and its role as a source of
identity and solidarity, has led some modernists to
reject the challenge of seeking a civilizational dia¬
logue. For myself, I do not think there is a neces¬
sary incompatibility between religion and modern
change, or democracy. History has revealed many
examples of the flexibility or plasticity of religious
traditions, as well as examples of intransigence. The
transition in the West from divine right monarchies
and feudalism to modern political and economic
institutions took centuries, and so too did the reli¬
gious response to the challenge of modernity.
Wc must realize that the modern transforma¬
tion of politics, society and religion is an open-
ended process, imperfect and incomplete. Just as
the successes of the modern nation-state cannot
be denied, so too its shortcomings must be identi¬
fied and addressed.
The eradication of poverty and illiteracy might
address some of the causes of religious and political
extremism, but it would not fully respond to the
deeper rcligio-cultural issues of identity, authen¬
ticity, culture and values that are of equal impor¬
tance. Addressing the difficult issues of religion
and modernity will require new theoretical and
conceptual perspectives.
How do you see the future?
J. L. E.: Religion and culture will remain a signifi¬
cant force in development. The "either . . . or"
dichotomies and allegiances of the past (secular and
religious, sacred and profane, traditional and
modern) will need to be transcended as govern¬
ments, societies, development experts and reli¬
gious leaders seek to identify areas for mutual
understanding and co-operation.
Aren't you forgetting that certain forms of
religious fundamentalism based on intolerance
and fanaticism pose a serious threat?
History has revealed many examples of the flexibility or plasticity of
religious traditions.'
Vilo
J. L. E.: There can be no doubt that religious
extremism is a serious threat. But the global resur¬
gence of religion and religious movements is a far
broader phenomenon, whose existence chal¬
lenges us to think about the specific forms that
pluralism should take in the societies of the South.

You believe that current patterns of
development are inimical to cultural pluralism
in the Third World. Why is this?
Smitu Kothari: In most Third World countries,
the kind of development that has been pursued in
the last five decades has widened the gap between
those who have benefited from it and those who
have become its victims. Structural inequity within
and between nations, discriminatory and racist atti¬
tudes and the politics of natural resource use are at
the core of this polarization.
Take the question of natural resources. The
unsustainable extraction of natural resources is con¬
trolled by and benefits a privileged few, while the

only for their subsistence but also as a source of their
identity, are marginalized. Global cultural and eco¬
nomic hegemony, supported by new communica¬
tion technologies, is radically altering or threatening
biological and cultural diversity. These issues arc at
the heart of the relationship between development
and culture.
Has nothing been done to halt these trends?
S. K.: Significant efforts have been made to deal
with these structural causes of inequity and there
have been many plans to alleviate poverty, and yet
the gap between rich and poor has grown wider.
In India, my own country, for instance, in 1990, 20
per cent of the population controlled 60 per cent
of the assets and the bottom 20 per cent only con¬
trolled 1 per cent. The polarization of wealth is
even more striking in countries like Mexico,
where the top twenty- four families in 1993 owned
more assets than 150 million people at the bottom
of society. It could be argued that despite a growth
in national and global middle classes, most national
and international development has reproduced
and intensified powerlessncss.
Inequality of access to productive resources
and widespread lack (and loss) of control over deci¬
sion-making among a majority of the world's popu¬
lation is one of the strongest threats to the diversity
of cultures and the wisdom and knowledge
enshrined in them. Market rationality and profit
maximization arc fundamentally incompatible with
ecological sustainability, cultural plurality and social
justice. And yet the fact that poverty and scarcity
can be induced by development is not even grudg¬
ingly acknowledged, and there continues to be an
almost spiritual belief that the market is a panacea.
What effect are the emerging global
alignments between multilateral banks,
transnational corporations and economic and
political elites having on cultural diversity?
S. K.: Many people are arguing that these align¬
ments are rccolonizing much of the planet in order
to sustain and widen their economic dominance.
Newer, more sophisticated forms of colonialism,
including the colonialism of the mind, may be a far
greater threat than the colonizations that occurred
in the past.
Current trends suggest that multilateral regimes
like the World Trade Organization, though seem¬
ingly non-partisan, are bound to further capitalist
accumulation by transnational corporations, indus¬
trialized countries and Third World elites.
Transnational corporations (TNCs) exercise
phenomenal influence over the global economy.
The top fifteen corporations now have gross
incomes that are larger than the GDP of 120 coun¬
tries. TNCs control 70 per cent of world trade and
own or control 80 per cent of the land that grows
crops for export. TNCs have been the main agen¬
cies that have aggressively pushed for deregulation
and privatization not only in national economies
but also in multilateral agreements and conven¬
tions in the world economy as a whole. Efforts to
make TNCs accountable and to develop a regime
of social control have floundered under the might
of the TNC lobby.
If the marketplace is the arena where ethical
and moral questions of our role on this planet are
sorted out, then culture will be restricted to
accepting the dominant trends and to displays of
theatre and dance during national festivals and
visits by foreign dignitaries.
How do the governments of developing
countries react to this?
S. K.: They hope that the dynamism and impetus
generated by "development" projects will lead to
progress and prosperity from which all citizens
will benefit through a trickle-down process and
that the fruits of science and technology will
spread to all. This presumption is proving difficult

to justify. Experience from countries across the
world suggests that the bitter medicine of struc¬
tural adjustment favours the privileged and
devalues or destroys those cultures, knowledge
systems and ecologies that stand in the way of
maximizing productivity and profit. At a time
when the desire for democratic process and
democratic institutions is growing, these countries
continue to be largely dominated by processes and
institutions which remain unaccountable and
undemocratic.
Most Third World states operating under a
dependent, capitalist mode of production have
gradually dispensed with traditional institutions
and spiritual ideologies, and seek legitimacy instead
through economic growth and the doctrine of
national security. In turn they endorse structures
of economic development and hegemonic com¬
munications both national and global and priv¬
ilege a corpus of dominant languages at the expense
of a vast pluralism of "people's languages".
And how are people, rather than
governments, responding?
S. K.: Faced with growing economic and cultural
insecurity, communities are reverting back to pri¬
mary or primordial loyalties. These are often rede¬
fined and manipulated by politicians to serve their
own ends. Resurgent ethnicities do not necessarily
become secular and egalitarian, still less do they pro¬
mote a truly democratic framework of diversity and
pluralism. States have, often successfully, tried to
selectively involve members of these ethnic groups
either to win their favour, to nurture dissension, to
retain control or seek political concessions.
The past decade has also seen states absorb
potentially "disruptive" associations, as well as other
dissenting activity. Competing claimants have been
absorbed into the machinery wherever possible.
When routine controls have been ineffective,
repressive measures have often been used. All this
makes the task of nurturing political and cultural
pluralism more difficult. Despite these trends, mil¬
lions of people are involved in diverse forms of col¬
lective action from linking the blocks of an eco¬
logically and socially just society to mass mobiliza¬
tion in the form of social movements.
What role should the state play in cultural
life?
S. K.: Serious problems arise when the state has
responsibility to interfere in culture. But then,
should this be better left to civil society? In this
case, who will be involved and how can represen¬
tation and participation in cultural life be ensured?
Won't the state always have to play some kind of
non-partisan mediatory role? If not the state, then
who will create the conditions that will nurture a
plurality of languages and literature? Who will pre¬
serve and vitalize the folk heritage?
This is a highly delicate issue since the insensi¬
tive handling of cultural identities creates an atmos¬
phere of mistrust resulting in clashes between dif¬
ferent ethnic groups and fomenting or resuscitating
recessive and hostile memories.
Paradoxically, there is a convergence between
a majority of Marxist and liberal opinion which
'Most national and international development so far has
reproduced and intensified powerlessness.'
SMITU KOTHARI,
of India, is a co-founder of
Lokayan, a centre promoting
exchange between intellectuals
from India and the rest of the
world.
argues that culturally defined groups must be inte¬
grated into the "mainstream", either to hasten the .
"proletarianization" of the rural areas or to achieve
a more "integrated" and homogeneous national
society. In fact, most development literature in
both these traditions fails to adequately acknowl¬
edge and explain both the homogenizing steam¬
roller effects of development and the persistent
vitality of culturally based movements and their
effects on people.
The situation becomes more complex when,
over the years, elites emerge from cultures that
have previously been subjugated and discrimi¬
nated against and seek power or legitimacy by inte¬
grating themselves into the institutional main¬
stream. In some cases, these elites have abused
their power and collaborated in the exploitation of
the natural resource base that is the source of the
identities and subsistence economies of their
ethnic group.
It is a tragedy that, in most parts of the Third
World, popular cultures, particularly those of
indigenous peoples, have been marginalized and
subjected to an unequal conflict with powerful
external political, economic and cultural forces.
Cultural symbols that give meaning to lives are
being lost, and to compound this loss, the newer
cultural experiences that people are exposed to,
such as television, advertising and consumerism,
give rise to a structure of meanings and values that
further undermine social and cultural security.
What specific impact are these processes
having on languages in developing countries?
S. K.: In countries like India there is still a phe¬

regard this diversity as pre-modern and inefficient,
as leading to political instability and technical back¬

cern with standardizing societies and streamlining
their activities, jeopardizing the maintenance of
variation as a vital reality of everyday life.
Is there a connection between
environmental and cultural issues?
S. K.: For many culturally and economically mar¬
ginalized people whose lives are critically dependent
on the natural resource base, the struggle to preserve
biodiversity forms part of the struggle for cultural
diversity. For them, nature is not merely a biological
entity a repository of forest, mineral and water
but a cultural entity. What they are defending is not
pristine nature but "social nature." Their position as
defenders derives not so much from the concept of
"nature under threat", as from an integral and inte¬
grated relationship with the land, water and forest as
the fundamental basis for their own elemental

them, is the basis of their cosmology.
Unfortunately, what is also being witnessed all
over the world is a pervasive feeling among the

tralized state structure that politically and cultur¬
ally "underdeveloped" people lack political matu¬
rity, rationality and efficiency to play a central role
in modern times.
What can be done to maintain cultural
diversity?
S. K.: There is a need to break the prevailing belief
that national and global elites are the cultural van¬
guard, that knowledge defined by them is liber¬
ating. There are some signs that this may be
starting to happen. The past two decades have seen
a gradual build-up of popular initiatives on the part
of those who have been marginalized and who
seek the democratization of the state and the estab¬
lishment of an egalitarian social order. These
people articulate an ecologically-sensitive, locally-
rooted system of governance. In India, for
instance, the rise of the Dalit movement and the

knowledge defined by elites is necessarily liberating.'
growing self-confidence and asscrtiveness of the
tribal people (of whom there are 60 million from
over 200 different cultural groups) are evidence of
fundamental shifts that are taking place in cultural
and political life.
It is, in fact, becoming increasingly evident
that, despite advances in urbanization and com¬
munications, there is little likelihood that cultur¬
ally diverse ways of living can be homogenized,
little chance that a single culture can be woven
from such disparate strands. Nevertheless, there
is no room for complacency, even though a diver¬
sity of subcultures will prevail. These subcultures
will need understanding and committed represen¬
tatives to contest the hegemony of the authori¬
tarian (though increasingly sophisticated) state or
reductionist economic development.
The fundamental challenge is that of creating
the political space in which the diversity of cul¬
tures can evolve democratic processes of mutual
understanding and tolerance. It is a formidable
challenge since it calls on us to reverse the con¬
quest of society by the economy, restore an ethic
of self-discipline and recognize that positive values
involve dignity as well as modest material security.
We must commit ourselves to a struggle based on
the belief that development is not feasible without
restoring ethics to economics, without returning
to a symbiotic relationship with nature, without
taking into account in all we do every person on
our fragile and beleaguered planet.

A ClOUS CIRCLE
BY TERRENCE HEATH
r
The accomplishments of tech¬
nology have been the text of a
hymn to progress that has been
loudly sung for the past 200
years. It has been largely a hymn
celebrating human control over Nature.
Recently, however, the celebration has
become more muted as we have begun to
realize some of the effects that technological
change can have not only on natural systems
but also on our social and political systems.
The most obvious concerns are what we call
"environmental problems". These include
the impact of the automobile and the house¬
hold refrigerator as well as the incalculable
issues associated with the operation of
nuclear power stations and the disposal of
nuclear wastes. Many other problems are
connected with heavy industry, raw material
extraction, production processes, disposal
methods, the use of non-degradable pack¬
aging and the overconsumption of renewable
and non-renewable resources made possible
through "improved" harvesting technology.
Managing the
environment
Solutions to these problems are almost always
conceived of in terms of managing the envi¬
ronment. Through monitoring, regulation,
better science and technology, and conserva¬
tion, we hope to correct at least the worst
aspects of what is wrong. This approach to
controlling environmental degradation is
largely what is understood by the term "sus¬
tainable development". Basically, we are
saying that the instruments by which the sit¬
uation has been created can also be used to
correct it. But while we must applaud
Western culture's concern to address the
problems that it created in the first place, it is
clear that this approach almost invariably pre¬
cludes looking outside the boundaries of
Western culture when trying to define what
sustainable means.
At the same time as technology is being
used to attempt to correct the problems it has
created, there is a growing awareness of the
social and political consequences of technology.
Examples could be drawn from indigenous cul¬
tures around the globe, but the Inuit of Arctic
Canada are a particularly striking example of a
people who live in a remote part of a highly
industrialized nation and have had to cope with
dramatic change in two generations.
The rifle, the powerboat and the skidoo
have, for example, changed the Inuits' techno¬
logical impact on their environment, and
imported technologies have also changed
social aspects of their culture. Inuit hunters can
now travel to herds, make kills and bring the
animals back to the settlement for processing.
It is no longer necessary for them to live in
camps close to the herds, and women and chil¬
dren no longer take part in the hunt itself as
they did during the time of camp life. The
women and children become increasingly set¬
tlement-minded, and this attitude is reinforced
by schools, health care facilities, jobs, and per¬
manent, independent homes.
Relationships within the family change;
the use of language changes; the role of elders
changes. In addition to its effects on the ani¬
mals and the terrain, the use of rifle, power¬
boat and skidoo also leads to a shift in cultural
relationships and in the relationships of the
Inuit with what they call nunavut ("our
land"). And, because the technology comes
from Western culture, the Inuit's culture is
also influenced by the methodologies and
assumptions of Western culture.
The case of the Inuit is relevant because
people of "civilized" cultures are becoming
increasingly uneasy with the results of their
activities and are turning to so-called "primi¬
tive" cultures for wisdom to guide them. The

wisdom they seek is largely what might be
called selective spirituality, that is, sayings,
prophecies and advice which can be separated
from the traditional context in which they arise
and which is often basic to understanding
them. They arc rarely attracted to the science,
technology and sustainable development for
subsistence of many of these cultures, even
though these may be the only base for coping
with environmental degradation.
Western technology and management
techniques are not only an integral part of
market- and commodity-based culture, they
also change every culture they come into
contact with. Because they are part of
Western culture which has a global system of
production, distribution and consumption,
they absorb, change and destroy other cul¬
tures, whether intentionally or unintention¬
ally. Even if local cultures wished to integrate
this technology and these methods, they
would have to be protected in order to have
the time to absorb and adapt. But Western
culture can only provide such protection by
dismantling its own dominance.
The failings of a
dominant culture
Western technology and management tech¬
niques are successful in dealing with isolated
parts of processes, but they are not only inad¬
equate, but actually destructive when dealing
with whole, integrated processes. If there is a
market for wood products, Western tech¬
nology and management can be applied to the
selection, planting, fertilizing, harvesting and'
marketing of, say, Eucalyptus trees, but they
are singularly incapable of dealing with the
integrated system of land, trees, water, human
subsistence, religion, art, memory, invention,
feedback and inter-regional relationships
which have to be modified or destroyed in
order to satisfy market demand.
The shadow side of the development of
Western culture has been a scramble to
counter-balance, modify, explain away, and,
on occasion, replace these methods which
were initially overwhelmingly successful but
eventually became terribly dangerous. Envi¬
ronmental degradation, which was accepted

in the belief that the resources of the planet
arc limitless, now threatens the very eco¬
nomic base that sustains the consumption
patterns of Western culture.
When green is the
dominant colour
Three strategic objectives have been pro¬
posed in order to cope with this degradation:
maintenance of essential ecological processes
and life-support systems, preservation of
genetic diversity, and sustainable use of
species and ecosystems.
There is a growing interest in attempting
to include environmental costs in the eco¬
nomics of development. These costs are
increasingly being referred to as "externali¬
ties", which in itself is semantically interesting
in assessing the mindset which is developing
them. There is even talk of the "countcrpro-
ductivitics" of economic growth, such as the
stress caused by what used to be called
TERRENCE HEATH

arts and the environment.
"labour saving devices". The industrial world
has moved from efficiency experts to stress
management experts.
Governments in the industrialized world
are attempting to adapt these solutions to
their legislative and development policies. In
Europe and North America, laws and regula¬
tions are slowly being put into place and pop¬
ular awareness is growing, both formally
through curricular development at all levels
of the educational system, and informally
through non-governmental organizations
dedicated to environmentalism. There is also
a growing awareness of the global responsi¬
bilities that some industrial enterprises should
embrace. "Being green" is even seen as a
competitive advantage for industrial firms of
the future.
No one would wish to discourage efforts
by Western culture to correct these prob¬
lems. Many if not most of those seeking
solutions to environmental degradation are
motivated by genuine concern. It must be
emphasized, however, that their solutions are
dominant culture solutions, based on tech¬
nological and managerial applications of the
methods and mores of that culture. Taken to
their ultimate stage, they envisage a planet
which is totally managed and technologically
controlled.
Us and them
Let us imagine that these approaches arc
completely successful and then ask whether
the resultant world is the world we want to
live in. In the North America of the 1 950s the
answer might have been an enthusiastic
"yes"; in the world of the 1990s I think I hear
a resounding "no". How can wc act so that
wc all can enjoy some of the benefits of tech¬
nology and management and not become
their slaves? How can wc limit the dominant
culture before it destroys itself and everyone
else along with it?
The most basic reason to be apprehensive
about the ability of Western culture to solve
the environmental problems it has created is
its marked inability to include itself in the
concept of nature. As someone once said in
response to a request for a definition of
"environment", "it is everything except me".
The word "environment" itself explains that
most clearly. The problems are "out there"
and wc will address them through tech¬
nology and management expertise. Coupled
to this attitude is the assumption that people,

usually others, are part of the problem and
that the solution lies in technology and man¬
agement, usually ours. A first step in looking
at the entire problem that the planet faces
might be simply to apply some of these solu¬
tions to Western culture.
Human cultures have adapted ideas, rit¬
uals, techniques and beliefs from one another,
and it might be argued that the success of the
human species has been based on this char¬
acteristic ability to learn, to adapt, and to be
open to the experience of others (even when
at times attempting to destroy them). One of
the most problematic issues concerning the
future of the planet is the seeming inability of
Western culture to understand and take seri¬
ously the experience of other cultures which
have developed very different solutions to
the problem of survival.
Perhaps a first step might be to apply to
human cultures some of the solutions being
proposed for environmental problems. The
destruction of human cultures is arguably
more devastating in the long run than the
environmental degradation of the planet,
which can be seen as its symptom.
Biodiversity is one area of concern to envi¬
ronmentalists today. The loss of species is
occurring at a potentially disastrous rate. The
triumphant "survival of the fittest" of nine¬
teenth-century science is suddenly sounding
hollow as we begin to realize that no species
survives by triumphing. Every survival is the
result of a complex system of life which
involves competition but also involves co¬
operation and dependence. And beyond that it
involves interdependence and enormous
diversity of plant, animal and mineral presence
to sustain the cycles within cycles of birth,
growth and death. The huge agro-businesses
are finding that the one-crop approach may be
a short-term triumph for technology and
management, but that the long-term results
are land degradation, displacement of peoples
with the accompanying problems of urbaniza¬
tion and poverty, loss of species, and eventu¬
ally a curve of falling profits.
A recipe for disaster
Monoculture in agriculture is a recipe for dis¬
aster, but what about monoculture in human
culture? We talk volubly about the loss of
species and the shrinking of the gene pool in
the environment, but what of the loss of lan¬
guages, words, thoughts, values, skills, rituals,
relationships, knowledge, traditions, not to
mention songs, dances, plays, adornments,
paintings, sculpture and sounds? What of
human diversity? It is possible that Western
culture can through conservation, preserva¬
tion and sustainable use partially manage the
loss of species. Is it not even more important
that the diversity of human cultures should be
conserved, preserved and used sustainably?
The agro-business, to use a much discussed
example, destroys species through the intro¬
duction of monocultures; it also destroys
human cultures through the concomitant
monocultural technology and management.
Diversity is as sure a sign of success in human
affairs as it is in the environment "out there"
and the two are intimately related.
It is difficult to imagine where the
counter-balance to Western culture can come
from if not from the cultures it has thus far
either pushed aside or treated as curios.
Without a counter-balance, it is difficult to sec
Western culture's "solutions" doing anything
but furthering the monoculture based on
technology and management which have
shown themselves inadequate to deal with
the situations they create. The most basic
solution will have to include local consulta¬
tion and decision-making and a cessation of
mega-projects which destroy environment
and human communities for the sake of
export markets and foreign capital exigencies.
But, beyond that level, we have to recognize
that sustainable development is not primarily
an economic/environment issue, but an issue
of sustaining the interrelationship of human
cultures and nature.

" I he far-reaching cultural

are becoming still more
radical through their links
with the globalization of
production and
consumption." Above, a
young consumer from Brunei.
n the second half of the twentieth
century, the industrialization of the
production of material goods, closely
linked to the industrialization of cul¬
ture, gave rise to new concepts of
development. The latest stages in this
process have been the integration of the mass
media into information superhighways and
the integration of national cultural circuits
into globalized systems.
The merger of computer science and
telecommunications, especially direct broad¬
casting by satellite and fibre optic cables, is
enabling the "old" communication media to
be used in new ways. Telephone, cinema,
television and video arc being brought
together in interactive transnational systems
which link up the networks possessed by
these media in the most remote countries.
These information superhighways arc
transforming scientific communication,
office automation, banking and intercompany
services and no doubt also the distribution of
cultural performances. Transnational compa¬

be broadcast by satellite to halls in hundreds
of cities on every continent without the lim¬
itations imposed by customs tariffs on cinema
and video films. What is more, access to
video games, teleshopping, national and inter¬
national news from television and personal
computers is being widely extended. The arts
arc being incorporated into these mass media
networks in order to expand their audience
and obtain financing.
As a result, the communication industries
are among the most dynamic agents of the
modern economy and constitute one of the
main sources of investment and employment
opportunities. In the United States they rank
second only to the aerospace industry as a
source of export earnings.
The media explosion
The far-reaching cultural changes brought
about by communication technologies are
becoming still more radical through their
links with the internationalization and global¬
ization of production and consumption, pop¬
ulation migrations and tourism. This global¬
izing movement is throwing national cultures
open to news, films, radio, theatre, television
serials and other entertainment forms pro¬
duced outside the country concerned.
Until twenty or thirty years ago, efforts
were made to control the challenge of these
communication flows between societies by
imposing time quotas for the broadcasting of
foreign programmes in each country. These
controls arc no longer feasible today for the
following reasons:
the deterritorialization of artistic production

which loosens its ties with any particular
country;
the existence of technological facilities which
can circulate mass media messages
throughout the world;
the increasing cost of film arid record pro¬
duction, which makes it hard to recoup
investment in a single country;
the monopolistic concentration of produc¬
tion and distribution in the hands of pow¬
erful multinational companies;
the transnational expansion of communica¬
tions, which has weakened local traditions
and given birth to a world folklore. Com¬
munities of consumers, especially young
people, are defining their cultural prac¬
tices on the basis of homogenized infor¬
mation and styles which seem acceptable
to different societies, regardless of their
own specific political, religious or national
concepts.
A system with built-in
inequalities
Today, all these factors arc leading to radical
changes which go beyond internationalization
or the opening of the geographical frontiers
of each society to goods and messages from
other cultures. The age of globalization is
being accompanied by an interaction
between disparate economic and cultural
activities brought about by a multi-centred
system in which the speed of world-wide
transmission and strategies for winning over
audiences completely outweigh local historic
traditions. The fact remains, however, that
this global reorganization of cultures does not
eliminate inequalities or asymmetry between
the metropolis and outlying regions.
In Latin America, the economic recession
of the past decade has impoverished local
artistic production and the capacity to play a
competitive part in international integration.
The contraction of public budgets and the
weakness of private enterprise, except for a
few big multinational businesses, confront us
with the paradox that more intensive trade is
being promoted between the receiving coun¬
tries and the metropolises while these coun¬
tries are producing fewer books, fewer films
and fewer records. Integration is being pro¬
moted at the very time when there are few
cultural goods to exchange, and falling wages
inhibit consumption by the majority of the
population.

The situation is even more dramatic in the
field of high technology and the information
superhighways. The subordination of the
Latin American countries is being accompa¬
nied by the elimination of customs tariffs on
foreign products as a result of the conclusion
of free trade agreements, while the few subsi¬
dies for local technological development arc
being further eroded.
Greater cultural and scientific dependence
on advanced communication technologies
which require heavy financial investment and
at the same time generate faster innovation,
will render the marginal societies more vul¬
nerable to transnational capital and to cultural
trends generated outside the region. That is
why the multicultural system and its inherent
inequalities are typified today not only by the
coexistence of different historical traditions



but also by the unequal access of different
countries, and of the different sectors of each
society, to advanced means of transnational
communication.
These inequalities have given rise to new

social injustices. The broad masses are
involved in the global culture to a limited
extent because they only have access to the
first stage of the audiovisual industries, i.e. to
the entertainment and news programmes put
out by radio and television services for which
there is no charge.
Some (minority) groups of the middle and
working classes have been able to gain access
to a second, more up-to-date and sophisti¬
cated tier of the communication media in the
shape of cable television networks providing
environmental and health education, political
information on videos, and so forth. Only
small fringes of the entrepreneurial, political
and academic elite are linked up to the more
active forms of communication, i.e. to the
third tier of the system, which includes the
fax, electronic mail, satellite dishes, and infor¬
mation and game networks ranging from
home videos to international electronic net¬
works of the horizontal kind.
World folklore and
traditional culture
The development of policies to promote
broad access to these second and third com¬
munication tiers is a necessary corollary to the
development of modern democratic forms of
citizenship which have the capacity to inter¬
vene significantly in the processes of global
and regional integration. The multinational
dimension of problems such as environmental
pollution, drug trafficking, and technological
and cultural innovation means that citizens
need to possess information which transcends
the local or national context.
We know that the process of globalization
docs not spell the end of ethnic, regional and
national cultures. The deterritorialization of
the arts is accompanied by effective reterri-
torialization in the form of social movements
which place emphasis on local characteristics,
and use mass media techniques such as
regional radio and television and the creation
of micromarkets for folk music and objects.
It is undeniable, however, that in many
countries, national and ethnic symbols are
ceasing to be the main references of social iden¬
tity and cohesion. The time has come to think
of ways of establishing equitable and creative
ties between the homogeneous transnational-
ization of styles of information and entertain¬
ment and the aspiration of local and national cul¬
tures to survive.

was there that people congre¬

Good urban design
Cities are also cultural artifacts in themselves.
Many of them commissioned artists, architects
and designers to embellish them and trans¬
form them into generators of the good life.
This tradition is still very much alive. The
commissioning of large scale public sculpture
has become common in the world's major
cities, some of which have developed exten¬
sive outdoor collections, while others have
used a single large-scale artwork to provide
themselves with a strong image, much as Paris
discovered it had done with the construction

(Spain) are familiar examples. The French
government has taken the idea of building
flagship cultural facilities to great lengths,
developing a number of great works in Paris,
including the Pompidou Centre, the Bastille
Opera House, the Grand Louvre project and
the Grande Arche to the west of the city.
Cultural Centres
In the late 1950s and 1960s, cultural centres
were widely seen as a solution to the prob¬
lems of housing the arts and of providing
access to them. They would create a critical
mass of activity and would facilitate cross-dis-
ciplinarity in the arts. In France, André Mal¬

Culture. They would be "... a meeting place
intended to bring cultural wealth of all types,
past and present, and of the highest standards,
to the widest possible public, with no one
excluded."
Yet experience with cultural centres has
been mixed. Many turned into retail outlets
for cultural products produced in pre¬
existing cultural capitals. Many were built on a
scale out of proportion to local demand.
Above all, from an urbanistic point of view,
there was a danger that they isolated cultural
activities on an island. Other solutions to the
geographic distribution of cultural institutions
and activities in the city came to be adopted.
Mixed-use developments
Mixed-use developments in which the arts
combined with other uses have long existed in
many European cities. As the British arts
adviser David Pratley has pointed out: "In

dens of the Palais Royal in the 1780s to create

the twentieth century American city. In Eng¬
land theatres and assembly rooms commonly
catered for performance, dances and dinners,
and elaborate pleasure gardens combined
nature and arts in the promenade, music and
dinner. The peculiarly English combination of
being ill and having a good time fueled the
development of entire spa towns in Bath,
Buxton and Cheltenham."
In the United States, mixed-use develop¬
ments were rediscovered both because they
avoid the sterility of segregated uses and in
the hope that they would improve the
chronic financial problems of cultural institu¬
tions by providing internal cross-subsidiza¬
tion of cultural activities. Rockefeller Center
in New York, begun in 1931, was originally
intended to provide a home for the Metro¬
politan Opera and cross-subsidize its opera¬
tion through revenues from the building that
was supposed to be built over it. Though this
never happened, Radio City Music Hall, art
galleries and theatres were built as part of the
Rockefeller Center complex.
Cultural districts include districts based on
artistic resources and programmes, which
might be called "arts districts", and districts
based on historic resources, which might be
called "heritage districts". In the former the
emphasis has been on integrating cultural
development into the overall growth and
development of the city rather than on iso¬
lating it in a cultural centre. In some cases, this
has been done by preserving long-abandoned
cultural facilities and developing the district
around them. Occasionally, entire new cultural
districts, such as the Dallas Arts District
(U.S.A.) or the Antigone district in Montpel¬
lier (France), have been created as the result of
large scale redevelopment plans. Frankfurt
(Germany) pursued this idea with great vigour,

is to attract artists to live and work there, cul¬
tural industries to locate there and cultural
institutions to develop around the cultural
infrastructure already in place.
Another spin on the idea is the European
Union's European City of Culture programme.
Originally intended to recognize those Euro¬
pean cities that had already developed an exem¬
plary public cultural life, the programme has
gradually been turned into one that provides an
incentive for bidding cities to improve the
quality of their cultural offerings. Glasgow's
successful bid to become the European city of
Culture in 1990 is widely regarded as a turning
point in that city's urban rcvitalization.

the Spoleto Festival (Italy), which have long
sought to move out of the normal performing
venues into the city itself, a new generation of
urban festivals is growing out of local arts com¬
munities to become part of the shared life of
the city. Over twenty years, First Night, the
New Year's Eve celebration in Boston, Massa¬
chusetts, has become a heavily attended cul¬
tural festival with performances by a thousand
artists. The idea has been adopted in over 130
cities in North America, and the International
Alliance of First Night Celebrations is
working to spread the idea of a New Year's
Eve celebration of the arts and culture to cities
around the world.
Festivals need not be solely based on the


performing arts. The Biennales in Bologna
and Venice feature the visual arts, and trade
fairs based on cultural industries bring
another kind of cultural festival to cities, e.g.,
the Cannes Film Festival and the Frankfurt
Book Fair.

describes a social group linked by traditions
of common descent and migration. Moana
means "ocean".
The project aims to encourage close ties
between the people of the region through
increased knowledge and understanding of
common historical links and dependence on

Pathways of Arab culture to Latin America
The goal of ACALAPI (Contribution of Arab Culture to Ibero-American
Cultures via Spain and Portugal) is to highlight aspects of Arab civi¬
lization that have influenced Latin America and flourished there, and to
promote exchanges between the Arab and Latin American peoples.
As well as studying mass migrations during the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries, the project sets out to identify elements of Arab
culture that survived on the Iberian Peninsula and moved to Latin
America. More specifically, the ACALAPI project emphasizes the Arab
influence on Latin American art, particularly through Mudejar art and
architecture; on agriculture and irrigation techniques; on plants and
crops such as sugar, rice, citrus fruit and industrial crops; on horse
riding, e.g. introduction of the Barbary horse; on pharmacology and
medicine; on literature (the Arab influence on Latin American literature
and vice versa); on music and folklore; on language; on the mass
media; and on education (again in both directions). The project aims
to highlight the role of immigrants in the cultural dialogue between
Latin America and the Arab world.

Cultural production: the gap between developed and developing countries
Evolution In the number of television and radio receivers in developed and
developing countries
Despite persistent inequalities, it is in the audio-visual field that the North-South gap is
shrinking the fastest. In 1970 figures show 259 television sets for 1,000 inhabitants in
developed countries against 10 in developing countries, or a ratio approximating 1 to 26.
The respective figures for radio receivers were 618 and 45, or a ratio of 1 to 13. Some twenty
years later, in 1992, the ratio for radios had hardly changed while for television sets, it had
narrowed to slightly more than 1 to 8.
Radio remains the privileged means of communication in rural areas. Its further growth
Is hampered by the cost of receivers and above all, of buying new batteries. The increase in
the number of televisions has gone hand in hand with urbanization. But while the number of
sets has shot up In the Third World, dependence on programmes produced In the North
remains very strong.

Unesco and its regional counterpart, the Institut du Sahel,
have launched two projects. One aims at improving methods of
animal husbandry, and the other is designed to strengthen sci¬
entific capacity in agriculture, forestry and animal husbandry.
The projects involve the nine Member States of CILSS

The United Nations launched a World Decade for Cultural Development (1988-
1997) with UNESCO as the lead agency, but covering the entire United Nations
system.
The Decade has four aims:
acknowledging the cultural dimension in development;
asserting and enhancing cultural identities;
broadening participation in cultural life;
promoting international cultural co-operation.
The Decade's action plan is based on two definitions adopted by the World
Conference on Cultural Policies which was held in Mexico City in 1982. The first of
these states that "Culture comprises the whole complex of distinctive spiritual,
material, intellectual and emotional features that characterize a society or social
group. It includes not only the arts and letters, but also modes of life, the funda¬
mental rights of the human being, value systems, traditions and beliefs." In other
words, development is a cultural process that cannot be imposed from outside or
presented as a gift from benevolent development agencies, but must be generated
from within each society itself.
According to the second definition adopted in Mexico City, development is "a
complex, comprehensive and multidimensional process which extends beyond
mere economic growth to incorporate all dimensions of life and all the energies of
a community, all of whose members are called upon to make a contribution and
expect to share in the benefits."
Research, pilot projects and the design of appropriate methods and tools have
been one part of the Decade's work. Another has been the sensitizing of decision¬
makers and world leaders to the importance of incorporating cultural considera¬
tions into development strategies. It is for this purpose that the World Commis¬
sion on Culture and Development was set up under the chairmanship of Mr. Javier
Perez de Cuéllar, former Secretary-General of the United Nations.

Its inception
Unesco, in conjunction with the United Nations, established the World
Commission on Culture and Development at the end of 1992. Com¬
posed of 12 leading figures from various backgrounds, including four
Nobel Prize winners, and chaired by Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, former
U. N. Secretary-General, this independent Commission was entrusted
with preparing the first-ever action-oriented World Report on the close
ties between culture and development. The main objective of this doc¬
ument, entitled Our Creative Diversity, is to shape the national cultural
and development strategies of the twenty-first century.

### 104461: Living in tomorrow's cities

commentar y
wiving
What will tomorrow's cities be like? Above all, will they be
decent places to live in?
The city is a focus of far-reaching changes in our time.
By the year 2025, an estimated 83 per cent of the popu¬
lation of the industrialized countries and 61 per cent of the
population of the South will be living in urban areas. But
while cities are focal points of progress and social change,
they are also crucibles of crisis and social tensions.
Urbanization is taking place on three levels: in mega-
cities, in medium-sized cities and in inter-urban areas.
Megacities, cities with more than 4 or 5 million inhabi¬
tants, are not specific to the industrialized countries. By
2025 18 of the world's 25 largest cities are likely to be sit¬
uated in the South. As great centres of international com¬
munication and exchange, these "global cities" form part
of an emerging new world map which increasingly ignores
the North-South divide between industrialized and devel¬
oping countries.
Medium-sized cities with a population ranging from
100,000 to 2 or 3 million are autonomous from and sub¬
ordinate to the megacities. They give structure to rural
areas and connect them with the urban world. Develop¬
ments of this kind in Asia and Latin America are the
world's fastest-growing urban areas, facing management
problems comparable to those of large metropolises.
Thirdly, the networks of exchange that link these cities
form a global urban framework within which the labour
force is being redistributed and large-scale population
movements are taking place.
While cities are places of dynamism, innovation and
opportunity, they also harbour poverty, violence, pollution,
unemployment, social exclusion, criminality, insecurity,
drugs and squalor. The problem of urban poverty is today
being discussed in terms (exclusion in France, underclass
in the United States, marginalidad in Latin America) which
reflect three different representations of urban space
inside/outside, high/low and centre/periphery.
Cities for citizens
The city is thus a meeting-point of three crises: a crisis
provoked by cleavages in society linked to social and eco¬
nomic injustice; a crisis affecting the types of social rela¬
tions traditionally associated with the urban habitat; and a
crisis of governance and political representation.
Although no two cities are alike, urban development
must follow one common guideline. The city and the
economy must be made to serve humankind, and not the
reverse, as is the case at present.

### 104461: Living in tomorrow's cities

The enjoyment of fundamental rights and freedoms pre¬
supposes the exercise of citizenship and participation in
the life of the community. The right to housing, the right to
a roof overhead for oneself and one's family, is a prereq¬
uisite for citizenship. UNESCO therefore has a duty to
remind the international community that the International
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
requires that "appropriate steps to ensure the realization
of this right" be taken.
Natural resources should be effectively managed in
big cities, but at present these are places where water and
energy are squandered. Cities also swallow up increasing
amounts of land as they continue to expand over arable
areas and green spaces. The expansion of coastal cities
even affects the marine environment. In the last quarter of
a century the population of New York City has risen by 5
per cent, but the area it covers has increased by 61 per
cent. Measures must be taken to ensure that activities to
protect the urban environment become a source of income
and enable the people who live in cities to take charge of
running them.
In many cases the management structures of large cities
are inconsistent with their demographic development.
U.NKSCO supports the introduction of urban governance
structures that clearly delineate the respective areas of
jurisdiction and responsibility of central and local author¬
ities. But it should not be forgotten that democratic and
effective urban governance is based on the participation of
city-dwellers and citizens' organizations in the life of their
community.
An open-ended heritage
Three main challenges face the cities of the twenty-first
century. The first is the introduction of democracy and
the creation of an urban community to which all citizens
belong; the second is the control of urban development
and hence the governance of cities; and the third is the
development and control of urban engineering, especially
during the current transition to a renewed sense of public
interest and to flexible negotiating procedures between
public bodies and private individuals.
Urban development has the potential to promote social
progress, improved access to information, education and
health, and the enrichment of ways of life and cultural
exchanges. But this calls for equality of access to the
city to its physical infrastructure, to education facilities
and employment. UNESCO intends to work towards this end
on two fronts: knowledge generation and action in the
field.
The city is an essential link between the individual and
the state. Just as local democracy and citizenship are the
cornerstones of the city as a moral edifice, social apartheid
is a sign of its degeneracy. Citizenship must be rooted in a
sense of solidarity arising from an urban culture that is
neither a standardized international culture nor a patch¬
work of antagonistic cultures but the outgrowth of a sense
of place and membership of a great urban community.
The city is an open-ended heritage and each city has its
own cultural personality. Modern building materials,
which bring improvements in terms of space-saving, health
and safety, are often at odds with aesthetic and climatic
considerations in the countries where they are used. Sci¬
ence and the arts must be harnessed to serve the city via
an interdisciplinary approach that encourages the emer¬
gence of a new generation of builders. The architecture of
the twenty-first century will have to strike a difficult bal¬
ance between modern energy-saving technology and aes¬
thetic traditions which exist in their own right and which it
would be wrong to ignore.
Training for city-dwellers
This kind of strategic urbanism must be seen in terms of
sustainable urban development. The use of durable mate¬
rials that are consistent with sound management of the
environment must be encouraged. Water, which is indis¬
pensable for hygiene, is being wasted at such a rate that it
is bound to be a major international issue in the coming
century, if it is not one already. Cities are heavy consumers
of energy, and will have to find new renewable and less
polluting energy sources. World energy demand, which is
expected to double in the next thirty years, will have an
incalculable effect on raw material reserves and on the
environment.
As a place where people live and move and have their
being, the city must provide equal access to the modern
communications and information media. In this way
everyone will have an opportunity to participate in the life
of the community and of the world. If tomorrow's city
dwellers are to be well adapted to their urban environ¬
ment, they will have to learn as early as possible to con¬
sider the city as a living environment, to feel self-respect
and respect for others.
UNESCO has developed an approach to these problems
which has three complementary components under¬
standing, action, and information and has created a
number of programmes to implement this threefold
strategy. The Management of Social Transformations
(MOST) Programme, the Man and the Biosphere (MAB)
Programme, the International Hydrological Programme
(IHP), and the International Geological Correlation Pro¬
gramme (IGCP) all aim to increase and disseminate knowl¬
edge. Secondly, a number of training schemes for those
concerned with urban issues are built into the MAB and
MOST programmes. They include schemes supported by
non-governmental organizations in many parts of the world
for restoring historic buildings, rehabilitating urban cen¬
tres, and promoting vernacular architecture and environ¬
mental and population education. Finally, since knowl¬
edge and expertise are only useful if they are shared,
UNESCO has developed a clearing house for information-
exchange and a data bank as part of the MOST pro¬
gramme. UNESCO is also pursuing a communication policy
designed to help town-planners, officials, educators, jour¬
nalists and civic organizations to strengthen solidarity, tol¬
erance, respect for cultural diversity and the culture of
peace in a word, everything that can form a common
bond between men and women everywhere. I

The last days of
han Chán
by Alfredo Pita
On the sandy reaches of Peru's
northern coast, lost in the wilder¬
ness a few kilometres from the
Pacific Ocean, lie the slumbering
vestiges of Chan Chán, a huge and
history-packed city built of adobe,
which for centuries has withstood
sea winds, earthquakes and rains,
which are uncommon but destruc¬
tive in this arid region of the sub¬
tropical zone.
But the greatest destruction of
all has been wrought by people in
search of building materials and
treasures. Intruders and plun¬
derers have gradually destroyed
the temples, disfigured the houses
and desecrated the tombs of the

former capital of the Chimú
Empire, which after its decline fell
into the hands of the Incas and the
Spanish, before finally being aban¬
doned. Nothing, then, remains of
Chan Chan's past splendours,
except a huge expanse of ruins cov¬
ering almost 20 square kilometres.
The name Chan Chán appar¬
ently comes from the Mohica term
jang-jang ("sun-sun"). Little is
known of what life was like there
in ancient times. But the modern
visitor, after tarrying a while in the
dead city, waiting for nightfall and
forgetting the distant roar of the
motorway, may feel the past spring
to life and sense the throb of the
thousands of people who lived,
worked and dreamed there.
It is not hard to imagine them
strolling through the city's well-
organized network of narrow
streets, entering little houses,
palaces and temples, tilling the
land, harvesting the produce of
their orchards and kitchen gar¬
dens, and observing the stars in the
hope of learning the truth about
the future and getting an answer
from the distant worlds they
thought they had come from. Like
the founder of their city, Tacay-
namo (a mysterious figure who
arrived there by sea in the eleventh
or twelfth century), the inhabi¬
tants of Chan Chán thought they
were descended from four stars of
the "Pata" constellation, which is
known to us as Orion.

sea shore and are scrutinizing the
starry heavens to find out what
the future holds in store and how
much further they have to go to
reach their destination, Chan
Chán, the capital.
Premonitory dreams
The two men are called Alentec
and Malakán. One is a prince and
administrator, the other a sculptor
and potter. But they have both
come from Paramonga, a war-torn
area on the furthermost reaches of
the kingdom. They bear bad tid¬
ings. The fortresses that were
holding back the advancing Incas
have been falling one after another.
Disaster looms unless major rein¬
forcements are sent immediately.
They know the city is not far
away now, but they have been
travelling along the shore for
nearly three days with hardly any
sleep. The following day they are
to appear before their lord, Min-
chancamán (the Chimo-Cápac). In
order to present him with a clear
report of the situation, they first
need some rest. They walk into
the dunes and, covering them¬
selves with their light coats, lie
down on a bed of warm sand.
They sleep fitfully. Their
dreams are haunted by the same
images their aproaching fate,
the end of time, the collapse of
everything that has made their
lives what they are. They belong
to different social classes but
have been friends since child¬
hood. Alentec is a nobleman,
while Malakán is of humble
origin, though he comes from a
family of artists which in a sense
makes him a nobleman: no one has
objected to the pledges of love he
has exchanged with Tsel, his
friend's young sister.
All this, and their whole world,
is now in mortal danger. The terri-
fyingly efficient army of the Inca
Pachacútec has been taking strong¬
holds and cities in the south one
after the other, and also threatens
to swooj) down on the kingdom
from the east. These are the tidings
they are bringing home: that the
lords of Cuzco have enough troops
and weapons to bring down for good
the proud Chimú Empire, which
has refused to hand over its riches
and is preventing them from
invading its vast and prosperous
coastal lands.
The Great Chimú Empire had
slowly grown up around the city in
the Moche valley where Tacay-
namo, founder of the city and the
kingdom, had arrived centuries ear¬
lier. He did not arrive alone: noble
warriors and other personages
accompanied him on great rafts.
They found a land devastated by
war and the ruins of the dying
Mochica kingdom, which had
known greatness centuries earlier.
Now the Quechua of Cuzco were
about to seize the country, just as
Tacaynamo had done in his time;
and the Chimú, if they survived,
would have to wait upon and pay
tribute to a sovereign other than
Minchancamán.
The great prince Minchan¬
camán, a descendant of Tacaynamo
and, like him, a son of the stars and
the sea, has brought the kingdom
to the height of its glory. A federa-

power, the Great Chimú Empire
now stretches from Paramonga and
Huarmey in the south to Tumbes
and Guayaquil in the north. The
cities and minor lordships pay
tribute to the great prince. Their
finest children and artists live in the
capital. Depending on their origins
and the art they practise, they
inhabit a district in the ten
"citadels" (or palaces) which, clus¬
tering together like an enormous
beehive, make up Chan Chán.
"It has always been so, and
maybe it will always be so as long
as time continues on its course, driv¬
ing the clouds, the river waters and
the sea," says Malakán. And his
friend replies: "if Suari, the old
woman who sells delicious chicha
(maize beer) at the market in the
gardeners' quarter is to be
believed, it has been prophesied
that within one or two generations
other founding fathers will arrive
dressed in glittering garments.
They will be the sons not of the
stars, but of the sun or the volcano,
for they will belch fin:. They will
arrive in huge ships; they will
defeat and subjugate all the peo¬
ples in this part of the world,
including the proud inhabitants of
Cuzco." "If that is true," says the
potter, "and if the Incas enter the
great city and take control of it,
then our descendants will ally
themselves with these new gods and
we shall again be free and masters
of our land." "We shall help them
so we can take revenge," Alentec
adds. "But the vanquished have no
rights before the victors. They owe
them submission."
A world on the march
With alarm, Alentec and Malakán
see in their dreams all the cities
they have known, with their tem¬
ples and their fortresses. They can
feel themselves becoming children
again, racing one sunny afternoon
through Chan Chan's narrow
streets and up and down its steps,
beneath the city's trapezoid walls,
which are as high as five or six tall
men. They know every nook and
cranny of its rectangular citadels,
of the walls marking the dividing
line between the fishermen in the
north and the farmers in the south,
between the potters and the brass-
founders. The capital has only one
entrance gate, giving straight onto
its narrow streets. This makes it
easier not only to control the popu¬
lation but to defend the city: even
the most seasoned troops will find
they have fallen inextricably into a
trap if they try to invade Chan
Chán. Alentec thinks: "This
defence system should safeguard
our future." But his friend, as
though reading his thoughts,
retorts: "Think again. We are
already being devoured from
within, just as the sweet, fleshy,
snow-white fruit of the eherimoya
tree is eaten by the worm."

same black colour as those of his
fellow potters, but they bear the
stamp of his personality and tem¬
perament. The neck of one of the
jugs represents the head and head¬
dress of a male figure solemnly
making love to a woman. Children
burst into laughter because they
think the figures portray the
potter's neighbours. His pots, on
the other hand, are a natural red¬
dish colour obtained by oxidization.
Malakán also uses these techniques,
but there is nothing light-hearted
about his version of realism, and his
sculptural compositions amaze both
connoisseurs and laymen with the
way they describe the joys and sor¬
rows of Chimú men and women, not
forgetting the animals that are their
faithful companions.
The two men then enter a
temple while a religious ceremony
is being celebrated and look in
amazement at the finery of the
dignitaries as they file before the
high priest. The highly sophisti¬
cated art of the Chimú gold¬
smiths is abundantly evident in
the gold and silver used for wor¬
ship, and in the masks, breast¬
plates and bracelets worn by the
nobility. The officiating priest
raises above his head a huge gold
tumi (ceremonial knife), with
turquoise inlays and a handle rep¬
resenting the divine figure of the
founding father. The knife is half
as high as a man and so heavy that
the priest finds it difficult to hold
aloft. The Chimo-Cápac wears a
gold mask and gauntlets, as well
as a diadem with pendant fig¬
urines that probably tell a story.

Their faces and clothes are cov¬
ered with gold and precious
stones: small discs, nose orna¬
ments, earrings, rings, pearl neck¬
laces and gold chains decorated
with human or animal figurines.
Alentec and Malakán are
excited by the brilliance of all this
gold and jewelry hut in fact it is
the fire of the rising sun that rouses
them from their slumbers. The
sun's rays will soon strike the bas-
reliefs and stuccoed paintings in
Minchancamán's Palace. The two
men look for the waters of the huge
canal which has enabled the engi¬
neers of the Great Chimú Empire
to enlarge the Moche Valley and
turn it into a vast orchard. After
washing themselves and taking a
few sips of water, they return to
the road that will lead them to the
palace. Their news is not good, but
it is a magnificent day and what dis¬
turbed their sleep was perhaps no
more than a bad dream. There
might still be a way out, a road to
salvation they do not know about,
but which the Chimo-Cápac does.
In an hour's time they will be
before him. They shout out to
announce their arrival, and sentries
answer them from the top of the
city walls. They can hear the sound
of voices and dogs barking. As soon
as they pass through the palace
door, members of the sovereign's
household will run up to welcome
them in the main courtyard.
History is certainly waiting for
them on the other side of the
door in that very courtyard
where a modern visitor lies
dreaming in the cool shade of a
tamarind tree.

CHAN CHAN IN BRIEF
The great pre-Inca metropolis of Chan Chán is
located on the right bank of the Moche 5 km from
the town ofTrujillo, on the road that leads to the
port of Huanchaco in northern Peru (La Libertad
department). It has been on Unesco's World her¬
itage List since 1986.
Chan Chán, which was the capital of the Great
Chimú Empire, is the largest pre-Hispanic city in
Latin America: it extends overan area of 20 km2 and
had about 35,000 inhabitants.
According to legend, the city was founded
in the 11th or 12th century by a mysterious figure
who arrived by seaas in the case of other peo¬
ples and nations of Latin America.
The Spanish conquistadors and their chron¬
iclers Cabello de Balboa in about 1586,
and Carlos Marcelo Come between 1604 and 1610,
collected legends that evoked its past splendour.
Archaeological evidence sugests that the Chimú
civilization succeeded the Mochica culture in
about 1200, on the very spot where that culture
had developed since the 4th century.
At the height of the Great Chimú Empire, the
Moche Valley (or the Santa Catalina Valley) became
the nerve centre of a vast empire. A highly sophis¬
ticated irrigation system diverted the river waters
along a canal about 80 km long and watered the
arid region around Chan Chán, rendering it fertile

by France Bequette
Straddling the borderline between
the United States and Mexico, the
Sonoran Desert stretches on the
American side from California to
Arizona and on the Mexican from
Baja California to the stale of
Sonora. It is home to the world's
largest ('actus, succulents and a
profusion of bushes, not to mention
numerous species of birds, insects
and mammals. It can get so hot and
it rains so little that the first mis¬
sionaries to set foot in the area
likened it to Hell. From the plant
and wildlife point of view it is one
of the richest deserts in the world
and has been lived in by humans for
more than 12,000 years.
On the northern side of the
border, the Organ Pipe Cactus
National Monument (OIU'I) was
proclaimed a national monument in
1937, then a UNESCO Biosphere
Beserve in 1976. South of the
border, several areas that had been
protected for a number of years
El Pinacate, the Gran Desierto de
Altar, the upper reaches of the
Gulf of California and the Colorado
Biver Delta were joined in a single

Biosphere Beserve named Alto
Golfo de California in 1995. Three
years before saw the beginnings of a
bold project for a Biosphere
Reserve that would cover some
28,700 km- and encompass the
entire Sonoran Desert, both its U.S.
and Mexican sections. The idea
emerged from a workshop attended
by scientists and administrators
from the two countries, who on the
same occasion created the Interna¬
tional Sonoran Desert Alliance
(ISDA) in order to maintain an on¬
going dialogue between Mexicans,
Americans and Tohono O'odham
Native Americans, and to integrate
conservation, research, education
and sustainable development.
Organ Pipe Cactus National
Monument
The most spectacular part of the
Sonoran Desert and the most typical
of its ecosystem is probably the
Organ Pipe. Cactus National Monu¬
ment, which covers 134,000
hectares on the American side of the
border. Despite the aridity of the cli¬
mate (an average of 23 cm of spo¬
radic, rain a year) and summer tem¬
peratures nudging 60° Celsius, 574
of the 730 vascular plant species (or
tracheophyta) in the desert are
found there; and more than 90 per
cent of these are endemic. The most
impressive plants are the giant
saguaro (Curnegiea giganteo), which
has become the symbol of the area,
and the Organ Pipe Cactus (Sfeno-
cereus thurbcri). The commonest
tree is the palo verde (Cercidium
microphyllum) that blooms with
small yellow flowers in the spring.
There is also an abundance of jojoba
(Simmondsia chinensis), agave
(Agave deserti) and one-seed juniper
(Juníperas monosperm a).
There is also a wide variety of
wildlife: 55 species of mammals, four
species of amphibians, 43 species of
snakes, 260 bird species and even one
species of fish, the desert pupfish
(Cyprinodon macularias eremus),
that is unique, to the United States.
It may well seem strange to talk of
fish and the desert in the same
breath, but OBPI contains 11
springs, three of which are perennial.
The largest is Quitobaipiito which
discharges nearly 130 litres per
minute and sustains a pond and a
green oasis. It was a vital staging-post
for travellers 400 years ago as they
passed along the Camino del Diablo
on their way from Mexico to Cali¬
fornia in search of gold and other
minerals. It was already a cross-roads
at the time of the llohokam culture
between 300 B.C. and 1400 A.D.
But intensive agricultural devel¬
opment and urbanization in the
neighbouring Mexican state of
Sonora, especially since the installa¬
tion of a high-voltage powerline at
Ilermosillo, are posing serious prob¬
lems for OBPI. Over 200 wells
pump 5,300 litres of water per
minute from the groundwater of the
Sonoyta Biver basin, i.e. two and a
half times its replenishment
capacity. Aerial spraying of crops
and the introduction of cultivated
exotic plants are added threats to
the park's natural resources. On the
American side unchecked irrigation
has already caused the salination of
200,000 hectares of land.
OBPI is bordered on the west
by the Cabeza Prieta National
Wildlife Refuge, which was created
in 1939 to protect the Desert
Bighorn Sheep (Ovis canadensis
mexicana) and the Sonoran Prong-
horn Antelope (Antitocapra ameri¬
cana sonoriensis). In 1942, how-

year long, and the ground is littered
with unexploded devices and debris.
Low-altitude flying by supersonic jet
fighters frightens the animals, but
experts admit that the refuge's envi¬
ronment is generally in excellent
shape because access to it is severely
restricted.
A study by Jennifer Jenkins of
the Yale School of Forestry and Envi¬
ronmental Studies points up what
she calls the "inconsistencies" of the
refuge system. On the one hand
refuges exist to protect biodiversity;
on the other, they have to receive
more and more tourists, hunters, and
oil and mineral prospectors, and at
the, same time withstand the conse¬
quences of the intensive farming of
neighbouring lands: pesticide run-off
and abstraction of groundwater sup¬
plies. A reform that would resolve
these, contradictions is underway.
The cinders of hell
The nature of Mexico's Pinacate
and Gran Desierto Beserve is quite
different. Essentially volcanic, the
terrain in its northern sector resem
bles the moon's surface so strongly
that American astronauts have
trained there. There arc more than
400 cinder cones, ten giant craters
(more like meteor impact areas
than volcano craters), lava flows and
gently sculpted sand dunes that
contrast sharply with the jagged sil¬
houette of the mountains. There
are more than 560 vascular plant
species, 56 species of mammals
(including the pronghorn), 43
species of reptiles, 222 bird
species and 4 species offish. Tem¬
peratures range between -30°Cel-
sius and +50°Celsius.
The reserve is managed by 26-
year-old Isabel Granillo, a graduate
in ecology. Unlike her American
counterparts, Isabel does not pack
a gun. And yet the reserve attracts
drug traffickers who use the flat-
lands as a runway for their small
planes whose cargo is intended for
the United States, some 50 kilo¬
metres away. "I'm not here on a
crime-prevention mission," she
explains. "All I can do is call the
police. I'm here to inform the
public." With the help of eight
young rangers, one of whom is an
O'odham, she criss-crosses the
reserve telling visitors not to leave
the beaten track, hunt, light fires,
leave litter or take anything away.
Anyone is liable to make a chance
archaeological find, since vestiges
of primitive tools, campsites near
watering holes (tinajas) and huge
figures etched into the volcanic soil
provide evidence that the area has
been inhabited by humans for more
than 12,000 years.
The eastern section of the Alto
Golfo Beserve is composed of two
core areas: the Sierra del Pinacate
(228,000 hectares) and the Sierra
del Bosario (42,000 hectares),
which are surrounded by a buffer
zone of 445,000 hectares. Isabel's
task is complicated by the fact
that the larger of the two core
areas is in the hands of small
landowners (ejideros) whose herds
compete with wild animals for the
meagre grazing lands and for
watering holes that are few and far
between. The area's 200 inhabi¬
tants live in tiny hamlets, work on

and- run roadside cafes or small
garages.
Shrinking wetlands
Further west, around the Sea of
Cortez, another core area consists of
165,000 hectares that are part
desert and part wetland formed by
the delta of the Colorado River. But
a huge dam on the United States side
of the border siphons off so much
river water for local agricultural
needs that the wetlands, located in
Mexico, are shrinking steadily. By the
time the Colorado empties into the
Sea of Cortez, it is a mere muddy,
over-salted trickle.
José Campoy and his wife
Martha Roman Rodriguez, two
biologists who have recently been
assigned to manage the reserve,
have begun by building a reception
centre, dwellings and research
facilities. Their job will not be
easy, for they will have to deal with
the conflicts created by the facts
of local economic life. Shrimp
fishing, for example, has been
banned from April to September,
and fishing for certain species such
as the totoaba (Totoaba mac-
donaldi) and marine mammals such
as the vaquita dolphin is prohib¬
ited in the Sea of Cortez. Talks are
being held with Mexican shrimp
fishermen in an attempt to per¬
suade them to convert to the fledg¬
ling ecotourism industry. But dia¬
logue is impossible with the drug
traffickers who dump into the Col¬
orado Biver crates of drugs
marked with cyanide-based fluo¬
rescent paint that can be seen at
night by their accomplices. Pollu¬
tion of the Colorado Biver is a
major problem, and some biologists
believe that damage to the estuary
is now irreversible.
A grassroots movement
One question that arises, in addition
to problems of legal definitions and
administrative boundaries, is what
conception do the locals have of a
Biosphere Reserve? Joaquin Mur-
rieta Saldivar, a Mexican studying in
Arizona, has written his doctoral
thesis on this subject. The notion of
development that benefits everyone
seems hard to grasp by those who
ask: "What's in it for me, right now?

Isn't it depriving me of my meagre
resources?"
To avoid friction, scientists, deci¬
sion-makers and locals must see eye
to eye so that no one group's inter¬
ests take precedence over the others.
With help from the International
Sonoran Desert Alliance (ISDA), dia¬
logue has already produced results
and some population groups have
reacted positively. The Tohono
O'odham, for example, have built
some small dikes to capture rain¬
water run-off and combat erosion. It
should be said that Anthony Ramon,
the President of the Alliance, is a
Tohono O'odham chief.
The Alliance encounters many
administrative roadblocks not least
the problem of crossing the border
but its monthly meetings (which are
conducted in both English and
Spanish) demonstrate its determina¬
tion to include the Biospheres of
Alto Golfo, OBPI and the Cabeza
Prieta Befuge in one huge Biosphere
Beserve. With the core areas already
determined, the only things left to
define are the buffer zones and the
transition areas.
Harold Smith, an ORPI super¬
intendent for the past fourteen
years, is optimistic, "We've shaken
up the general apathy," he says.

prospects. It is like a flower that is

THE RISING URBAN
TIDE
A report from the U. S. -based World
Resources Institute predicts that by
the year 2015 the world will contain
33 megacities with more than o mil¬
lion inhabitants and more than 500
cities with at least one million. The
population of cities in developing
countries is growing by more than'
150,000 people per day, and by the
year 2000 the area of these cities
will have doubled since 1980. In the
near future a majority of the world's
population will be dwelling in cities,
exerting phenomenal pressure on the
planet's resources and equilibrium.
The report, which contains many
more statistics, is published by the
World Bank in 7 languages and is

VOTERS TARGETED
IN HUNTING LAW POLL
Should bears, pumas and lynxes be
hunted with dogs or bait? Is it right
to hunt wolves from a helicopter?
Should traps be allowed? Seven of
the U.S.A.'s 50 states will go to the
polls next November to vote for or
against certain hunting practices.
Supporters of hunting see these ref¬
erenda as a way of prohibiting the
use of a natural resource, whereas
animal lovers see them as a way of
hailing cruelty to animals. Ecological
or ethical questions apart, however,
the stakes in the vote are also polit¬
ical. Is it a step towards replacing the
legislator by referenda on certain
issues?

When the role of chlorofluorocarbons

WHEN MOTH STINGS BEAR
In some parts of North America, the voracious appetite of the
gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar), is contributing to the decline of
the black bear (Ursus americanas). The larvae of the moth,
which was introduced into North America around 1869, devour
the leaves of trees and can kill weaker, hollow specimens. To
assess the impact of this moveable feast on the bear population
of the Shenandoah National Park (Virginia), American
researchers fitted out 54 bears with radio collars. Results of the
study show that in this neck of the woods, deprived of the acorns
they depend on and the hollow trees they use for dens, the black
bear is on the decline.

A LAKE THAT RUNNETH OVER
Lake Van (3,500 km-) in eastern Turkey, is the country's largest
lake. In 1968 its water level suddenly rose by 1.2 metres, and
again in 1988. A new rise in 1995 caused flooding at the local
airport, railway station, school and military base. In the last 27
years the water level has risen by 2.7 metres. A 50-page report
by geologists, cartographers and meteorological engineers sug¬
gests that heavy rains may have caused a drop in the average air
temperature and a decrease in evaporation. Not everyone agrees
with this explanation, however. Some have even gone so far as to
suggest that a denizen of the lake may be a cousin of Nessie, the
legendary Loch Ness monster.
THE PANTANAL:
A WETLAND UNDER THREAT
The estuary of the Paraguay River ("Pantanal" in Portuguese,

With 658 bird species, some 1,100 butterfly species, more than
400 species of fish and numerous mammals, it is also one of the
planet's richest sanctuaries of biodiversity. But this exceptional
area is being threatened with irreparable damage as a result of
a proposal to straighten the course of the Paraguay to facilitate
river transport of farm products and minerals to deep-water ports
in Uruguay and Argentina. Dredging would cause erosion, and
the river would flow faster, bringing the threat of disastrous sea¬
sonal flooding. Even so, river transport may be less harmful to
the environment than a road or rail system.

DOUDOU
N'DIAYE ROSE
Praise-singer, musician, and living repository of oral
history, the griot is an important figurein West Africa.
Doudou N'Diaye Rose, chief drum major in Dakar, is the
most famous living Senegalese griot. He has revolu¬
tionized the language of drums and spent many years
touring the world with his talented troupe.
How did your parents react
when they found out you loved
music?
Doudou N'Diaye Rose: Very
badly to start with. My great¬
grandfathers, whom I never
knew, were musicians. But
alter them no one in my family
had played music profession¬
ally. Several of my relations
were intellectuals. My father
worked as a chartered accoun¬
tant and had been a builder.
When I was about nine years
old my urge to play drums
became irresistible. I went all
round Dakar in search of a
suitable teacher. In the end I
chose El lladj Mada Seek,
who was a drum major. I spent
my whole childhood with him.
How did he teach you?
D. N'D. R.: He got us to come
round to his house. lie
explained the meaning of
rhythms and demonstrated
them on the drums. He let us
choose an instrument, then
asked us why we had chosen
it. In traditional Wolof music,
you have to be able to play
every kind of drum. First you
learn how to play the gorong,
ISABELLE LEYMARIE
is a Franco-American musicologist.
then after a few months you go
on to another, then another.
We did little jobs for our
teacher in exchange for
lessons. When he went to play
at a baptism or a wedding, we
pupils would take his drums
along, lie only turned up at
the last minute. We also
helped him make his musical
instruments. Very early on I
began to go to various kinds of
ceremonies with more experi¬
enced musicians, and as they
thought I was talented they
let me play.
The study of percussion
instruments involves a great
deal of work, and I had to
practise alone. The trouble
was, my maternal uncle for¬
bade me to practise. When¬
ever he found out I'd played
truant in order to devote my
time to music he gave me a
good spanking. My teacher
came to talk to him and put in
a good word for me. My family
also pleaded with him to be
more indulgent, but for years
he kept on beating me and
he was a big man! We finally
came to a compromise. I
attended school regularly and
in return I was allowed to play
at weekends. I ended up
taking my school certificate,
then I went to technical col¬
lege. For some years I even
worked as a plumber.
Were you paid when you took
part in ceremonies?
D. N'D. /?.: Yes, and I took
the money back to my family.
Even then, they didn't want to
know. It went on like that until
one day, when I was nineteen,
my uncle came to give me yet
another spanking and I stuck
up for myself. It has to be said
that by then everyone was
already talking about me as a
musician. My teacher some¬
times accepted two engage¬
ments and passed one of them
on to me. I was invited all over
the country. In the end, when
my uncle realized how suc¬
cessful I was, he felt ashamed
and apologized to me. By the
time he died he had com¬
pletely redeemed himself. He
protected me with his lucky
charms and became my body¬
guard. I paid for him to go on
a pilgrimage to Mecca.
How did you build up your
international career?
D. N'D. R.: When I was
twenty-five, my teacher went
to live in Côte d'Ivoire, leaving
me his musicians and his
instruments. I became a chief
drum major and played with
the group until I was thirty.
Two years later, I decided I
wanted to learn Senegal's var¬
ious traditional rhythms and
their meaning, so I travelled all
over the country, spending
about three months in each
region. I would approach the,
elders, bringing them rice,
sugar, candles and other gifts
in exchange for their teaching.
I learned how news had been
announced with drums in
Senegal's ancient kingdoms.
The kings had their own per¬
cussion groups, and the leader
of the lamp drums, who was
known as the fara lamp,
passed on the king's messages
to the people. Each instru¬
ment had a well-defined role.
A drum called khin was
widely used at court. It is now
used by a Murid sect for
Muslim ceremonies. I also dis¬
covered a very old square
drum mounted on a frame, the

A similar drum has been found
in some mountain communities
in Jamaica, where it is called

D. N'D. R.: The word gumbe
is also used in Senegal. It is
the name of a dance which is
also old accompanied by
singing, where women would
delicately raise their volumi¬
nous boubous. At a concert we
gave recently in Bahia the
audience was very enthusi¬
astic, because we were giving
them an opportunity to listen
to their musical roots. In
1960, when Senegal became
independent, I joined the
Senegal Ballet, and we went on
tours to Europe Czechoslo¬
vakia, Bomania, Turkey. Then
I decided to form my own
group and taught music to my
children. Now they work with
me. In 1980 I set up the
Rosettes, a female percussion
group, then the Roseaux, a
troupe of children aged
between four and twelve. They
performed in Japan last year.
How did you come to play with
Miles Davis?
D. N'D. /?.; Miles had heard
me on tape and asked me if I'd
like to play in the first half of
his concert at the Parc des
Expositions in Paris. When the
concert was over, he came and
improvised with us. I've also
played in the first half of con¬
certs by the Boiling Stones
and several French singers.
How did you learn to dance?
D. N'D. R.: By watching other
people. All drummers know
how to dance. It's vital to dance
well in order to play drums.
Do dancers depend on the
drums or do they invent their
own rhythms?
D. N'D. R.: They follow the
drums, but each dancer has his
or her favourite rhythms and
can ask the musicians to play
them. It's the drum major who
changes the rhythm, and he
has to know what kind of
instrument a particular musical
genre should be played on.
What's more, each dance has
its own symbolism.
Are old dances still
performed?
D. N'D. R.: Yes. The yaba,
for instance, which is a partic¬
ular favourite with older
women in the regions of Saint-
Louis, Dakar, Corée and
Rufisque. It can be danced for
hours on end. It was originally
a dance for courtesans. Only a
few years ago, women would
still put on their finest attire
and jewelry, and do their hair
in little plaits. They showed
off their dresses and gems as
they danced. Some of them
undid their hair, then plaited
it again as they continued to
dance. During this dance the
men would try to seduce the
women. Many couples first met
when dancing the yaba, and
some have since been married
for forty years! Another dance
is the uongue, which is per¬
formed by initiates after cir¬
cumcision, or danced to cele¬
brate the end of the harvest.
The farevoudiare is danced
by boys who are trying to
appeal to girls. If a girl finds a
dancer to her liking, she lets
him know by taking off her
headscarf and throwing it
down in front of him. Lebou'
women prefer the mari
gorong, where the rhythm is
provided by two drums. It is
danced at baptisms and wed¬
dings, as well as at circumci¬
sion ceremonies. Griots may
sometimes play for traditional
Senegalese wrestling bouts. On
these occasions they use a
drum with a low sound, which
has the same name as the
sport itself: lamp. Here again
the drum major leads, with
ten or so drummers behind
him. Certain passages in
pieces played on the khalam
(a Wolof lute) may be accom¬
panied by mu filed drums.
Has the drums' repertoire
changed down the years?
D. N'D. R.: Yes, enormously.
The mbalax, for instance, is a
basic rhythm which came into
being in the 1970s and is
played by one or more drums
for festive dances performed
during certain ceremonies
such as baptisms and wed¬
dings. The younger generation
has changed. They know how
to dance to new rhythms,
though some youngsters some¬
times ask ine to play them old
ones. A very expressive dance
that is all the rage with the
Senegalese today is the
digente niit at nit (under¬
standing between human
beings), in which the dancers
put their hands on their hearts
and pretend to sleep. Its mes¬
sage is that everyone should
get on with everyone else and
open up their hearts from
dawn to dusk.
B Since the griots' usual role is
to keep traditions alive, were
your compatriots surprised when
you created new rhythms?
D. N'D. R.: i\oand I've
invented more than 500 of
them. Actually, that's what
helped me to become popular.
I didn't think it was right that
my predecessors created
rhythms and 1 didn't. I've been
inspired by events like football
matches. Creating is something
that is always uppermost in my
mind. I have composed the sig¬
nature tune of Senegal's televi¬
sion news, among other things.
It came to me one night when I
was in a hotel in Romania and
couldn't get to sleep. I could
hear windows banging, birds,
wind and rain, and I recorded all
those natural sounds on a little
tape recorder. When I got back
to Dakar, I went to the beach
and continued recording the
return of the pirogue boatmen,
the roar of the sea and, (luring a
football match, the cheering of
supporters, the sound of the
ball hitting the ground, and the
shouting of players. I had a
good think, then I translated all
those impressions into the lan¬
guage of drums.
How do you compose?
D. N'D. R.: J hole up in a
house I own near Dakar, so I
can get some peace and quiet.
I invent sequences of rhythms,
which I then work together.
As our music is passed on
orally, I've created a code of
gestures that enables me to
tell the musicians when to
increase their tempo or
volume, or when to change
rhythm. There are passages
where I improvise, and where
the other drummers have to
follow me.
What plans do you have for
the future?
D. N'D. R.: I would like to
organize a concert in France in
the year 2000 which would
demonstrate the wealth of
Africa's rhythmical and
musical heritage. I'll shortly be
touring Africa, from the
Maghreb to South Africa,
looking for musicians and
dancers. The show should
include rhythms, musical
instruments and costumes from
various African countries. I

RS TO THE EDIT
THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE
PROCESS
The Appeal by the Director-General
of UlNESCO for the continuation of
the peace process in the Middle
East, published in your April 1996
issue, raises a number of questions.
No human being worthy of the name
could fail to oppose terrorism. But
terrorism does not arise sponta¬
neously. It is fed by bullying, humil¬
iations and constraints imposed on
peoples whose condition is not far
from slavery. If the many resolutions
taken by the United Nations had
been effectively implemented,
would things be as they are today, in
the Middle East and elsewhere? Is
it not the case that many heads of
state have no intention of translating
their fine words into deeds? In
which ease, President Charles de
Gaulle's description of the UN as a
"thingummyjig" is very apt.

and would like to express our sup¬

LYING BY OMISSION
The illustrated pages devoted to the
Second World War in your December
1995 issue ("Troglodytes, a hidden
world") give a good picture of how
the war developed. However, they do
not show clearly enough how the
"democratic" powers, which chose to
appease Hitler in an effort to push
him eastwards, encouraged the war¬
mongers, and how their non-interven¬
tion I'm thinking particularly of
republican Spain and Czechoslo¬
vakia ultimately cost the lives of
more than 50 million people on the
European, African and Asian fronts. I
spent four years in Mauthausen con¬
centration camp where 102,000
people died of overwork, hunger,
beatings, rain, cold, wind and snow. I
am the sole survivor of the 23 July
1941 shipment. It is not easy to tell
the story of the Nazi era, but lying
by omission condemns us to endure
anew trials and tribulations for which
we paid such a heavy price.

A PERSONAL OPINION
I read very carefully the articles on
the complexity of world problems
published in your February 1996
issue on complex thought. The con-
elusion drawn by Mr. Ivar Ekeland
at the end of his article on com¬
plexity seems to me extremely sim¬
plistic, however. It strikes me as
frivolous to compare the vicissi¬
tudes of weather and climate with
the governance of the United
States. Most industrialized coun¬
tries are run by powerful financial
groups, and unemployment in these
countries is neither fortuitous nor
The 10th Bordeaux Book Fair
The Unesco Courier will be represented at the 10th Bordeaux
(France) Book Fair ("Salon du Livre de Bordeaux"), which is to be
held from 10 to 30 October 1996.
The Fair will include two exhibitions, one devoted to the Sur¬
realists, the other to the French philosopher René Descartes, the
400th anniversary of whose birth is being celebrated this year.
The Fair will give a prominent place to literature for young
people and to comic strips. Young readers will have an opportunity
to meet their favourite authors and a jury of teenagers will award a
prize for a first novel.
This year's annual foreign literature prize, which honours a
non-Francophone writer and the quality of the translation of
his/her work into French, will be awarded to the Italian novelist
Pier Maria Pasinetti and his translator.

uncontrollable. Compared with
these bastions of economic power,
the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights looks like a catalogue of
pious hopes. Yet generous-minded
people like, the Abbé Pierre in
France have a more humane and
realistic view of things, and others
such as Nelson Mandela have risked
their lives and liberty to give sub¬
stance to these rights. But such
people are rare. Too many people
in high places are too comfortably
ensconced in the system to want to
change it. A regular Courier reader
for the past 10 years, I hand on
your magazine to local youth clubs
or reading rooms when I've finished
reading it.

CLASSICAL BALLET
IN OUR TIME
I was very interested to read your
January 1996 issue entitled "Dance,
the sacred fire". The articles on the
aesthetic and social aspects of dance
are of good quality and could be
used for reference by anyone, inter¬
ested in our art. But what a pity that
there were no articles on the extraor¬
dinary heritage of the classical ballet
tradition. Safeguarding the enduring
values of this tradition and making
them more widely understood should
be part of the agenda of our time.

After three years of work and reflection, the World Commission on Culture and Development,
comprised of 14 leading figures from a wide range of professional backgrounds, including four
Nobel laureates, has unveiled its report, Our Creative Diversity.
By reflecting upon a series of themes, the report broadens our concept of creativity, offering
new approaches that heighten awareness of the cultural underpinning of human development.
An International Agenda, intended to influence cultural strategies in the 21st century, makes
ten recommendations, including the protection of cultural rights as human rights; the
application of a new global ethics in global governance; the implementation of policies to
enhance access to, and diversity and competition, in the international media system; and an
international plan for gender equality.
