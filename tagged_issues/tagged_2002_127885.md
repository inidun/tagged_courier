### EDITORIAL

One year and one day after
September 11, 2001, President
George W. Bush announced
before the General Assembly of the United Nations that the
United States would return to UNESCO after an absence of
18 years. A founding member of the Organization in 1945,
the United States played a key role in helping to define 
its mission: the promotion of human rights, of the free flow
of ideas and of information, of scientific and cultural
cooperation, and of educational opportunities for all. None
of these pursuits is less urgent today than was the case half
a century ago. But none either is more important in 
the current international climate than UNESCO’s overriding
ambition: to mobilize States, but also academic and
scientific institutions, schools, libraries, museums,
enterprises and ordinary citizens in all walks of life who feel
they share a common responsibility in laying the ground for
a genuine and sustained dialogue between cultures.
A few weeks after 9/11, the General Conference of UNESCO
– the first international gathering at ministerial level since that
fateful day – unanimously adopted a Universal Declaration on
Cultural Diversity*. Calling cultural diversity one of the roots
of development, “as necessary for humankind as biodiversity
is for nature”, the Declaration affirms “that respect for the
diversity of cultures, tolerance, dialogue and cooperation, in 
a climate of mutual trust and understanding are among the
best guarantees of international peace and security”. Adopting
this ground-breaking text, the 188 member-States of UNESCO
rejected the theory of the inevitable clash of civilizations 
and forcefully condemned all forms of fundamentalism.
Afghanistan – subject of the Focus section in this, the first
full-fledged issue of the new Courier – is a land where war
and the cult of ignorance, of segregation and of violence 
have brought ruin, despair and, today, a breath-taking task of
reconstruction. It would be worthy of interest and active
compassion for those reasons alone, but there is more.
Afghanistan once was, and for centuries, the site of a most
extraordinary fusion of cultures, perhaps without parallel 
in history. What little has survived gives special poignancy 
to the concept of “common heritage of humanity”.

More black men in U.S jails
than in higher education
When a bolt of lightning
chipped the top off the
Aksum obelisk at the
Rome headquarters of the
UN Food and Agriculture
Organization in the night
of May 27, the Italian
government didn’t expect
to be hit as well.  This
time round the bolt did
not come from the sky,
but from the Ethiopian
government, that blames
Italy for the damage.
Addis Ababa has now
complained to the
Organization of African
Unity, calling on Italy to
return “its” monument.
In fact the clash is not
new. In 1937 Mussolini’s
armies pillaged the 24-
metre-high Yemenite-style
funerary monument from
the ancient kingdom of
Aksum, where it had
stood since the early 4th
century. In 1947, after the
Second World War, Italy
and the United Nations
signed an agreement to
give it back. But, despite
repeated requests from
Ethiopia, this costly and
technically difficult
operation has never been
carried out. The damage
caused by the violent
storm has rekindled the
debate.
Lightning strikes twice
in Rome
The number of black
men serving time in
American jails has
grown fivefold over
the past 20 years, to
the point where more
black men are behind
bars than are enrolled
in colleges or
universities.
According to a
recent study by the
Justice Policy Institute,
a Washington – based
research and advocacy
group, there were
791,600 black men in
prison in 2000, and
603,032 enrolled in
colleges or
universities. This is a
dramatic reversal of
the situation in 1980
when, reports the
Institute, there were
143,000 black men
behind bars but
463,700 enrolled in
higher education.
Speaking to the
New York Times
newspaper
(28.08.2002), Hilary
O. Sheldon, the
director of the
Washington Chapter
of the Association for
the Advancement of
Coloured People, said
“It is indeed a sad
statement about our
nation that it appears
to be easier for
governments to invest
precious public
dollars into the
incarceration of
African-American
men that is is for
them to invest in
higher education.”
Africa: the deadly spiral
of  famine and AIDS
Southern Africa is living
through its worse famine
in a decade. The World
Food Programme (WFP)
estimates that seven
million people in the
region require food
immediately, a figure that
could rise to 14.4 million
from December to March
2003. To cut short a
humanitarian crisis, WFP
has launched an appeal
for emergency food aid to
six hard-hit countries in
the region: Lesotho,
Malawi, Mozambique,
Swaziland, Zambia and
Zimbabwe. The operation
targets the most
vulnerable families,
notably those hit by
HIV/AIDS.
Intricately connected,
famine and HIV/AIDS
“make the situation in
several countries
practically
unmanageable,” says
Victor Angelo, UN
representative in
Zimbabwe. He foresees
an increase in HIV/AIDS
mortality due to lack of
food.
The links between
agriculture, food security
and AIDS are clear.
According to a UNAIDS
study, households
affected by AIDS spend
half as much  time on
farm work as healthy
ones. In Burkina Faso and
Ethiopia, the epidemic
has pulled about 20
percent of families away
from the fields. In
Tanzania, food
consumption fell 15
percent following the
death of adults who were
food providers to next-of-
kin. In Zambia,
households’ monthly
income plummeted 80
percent, while in Malawi,
thousands of households
are headed by orphans
who have lost their
parents to the pandemic.

Birth of the ICC
Floods, fires, drought,
smog and … El Nino
The scientists have
confirmed what many
suspected:  El Nino - the
cyclical warming of the
tropical Pacific - is
building up again. It
seems that it is not as
strong this time as in
1997-98, when the global
weather disruptions it
triggered caused damage
estimated between US$32
billion and US$96 billion.
Nonetheless, last July and
August bought a bumper
crop of natural disasters.
Southern China, Nepal
and South East Asia
experienced torrential rain
and mudslides. In
Bangladesh half a million
people were stranded in
floods, while a heavy
monsoon in India’s Assam
State inundated over 1,000
villages, pushing 700,000
people out of their homes.
Ironically, across the
continent in Rajasthan
and Punjab states, the
monsoon largely failed for
the fourth year running –
possibly because of a
three-km-thick smog cloud
hovering over much of
South Asia.
Too wet in some places,
too dry in others. A
drought has been ravaging
Mozambique, while
exceptionally dry
conditions in eastern and
central Australia have cost
the economy as much as
US$1.6 billion.  Massive
forest fires scorched parts
of North America.
While torrential monsoon
rains are seasonal - and
essential - in South Asia,
they are exceptional in
Europe. But in August the
worst rain for 200 years
caused several rivers to
burst their banks, putting
the historic cities of
Dresden and Prague under
water.
After 50 years in the
making, the International
Criminal Court (ICC)
came into force on July 1
2002.
The ICC is the first
permanent international
tribunal with the authority
to prosecute individuals
responsible for the most
egregious violations of
international
humanitarian law and
human rights: genocide,
war crimes, crimes against
humanity, and once
defined, crimes of
aggression.
The tribunal, which will
have a permanent seat in
The Hague, has
jurisdiction that is
complementary to
national laws. States have
the primary responsibility
and duty to prosecute the
most serious
international crimes,
while allowing the ICC to
step in only if they fail or
are unwilling to carry out
their duty. This “principle
of complementarity”
should provide incentives
to states to modernize
their judicial systems,
reinforce the
independence of the
judiciary and encourage
cooperation between
police and the judiciary.
With the creation of
the ICC, sexual violence
and crimes (rape, forced
pregnancies, sexual
slavery) as well as
persecution based on
sex are for the first time
recognized as war crimes.
The first meeting of the
Court’s governing body,
the Assembly of State
Parties, was scheduled for
September 2002.

Fast-tracking 
education for all
Death penalty abolished
in Turkey 
Africa on air
Twenty three countries in
sub-Saharan Africa, East
and South Asia, Eastern
Europe Latin America and
the Middle East are the first
beneficiaries of the World
Bank’s Education For All
Fast Track programme,
announced earlier this year.
Eighteen of them will
receive extra financing to
strengthen their education
systems to  provide access
to quality education for all
children by 2015. The other
five - India, Pakistan,
Bangladesh, Democratic
Republic of Congo and
Nigeria, which account for
50 million of the world’s 113
million out-of-school
children – will receive help
to address the data, policy
and capacity gaps that need
to be resolved for them to
qualify for extra funding. 
The 23 are among  88 low
and middle-income nations
which will fail to meet the
2015 deadline (set at the
World Education Forum in
Dakar, Senegal, in April
2000) without a special
effort from national
authorities and the donor
community.
At its June meeting in
Canada, the G-8 countries
promised to significantly
increase bilateral funding for
education in developing
countries that demonstrated
their commitment to
universal primary education
and those countries
emerging from conflict.
http://www1.worldbank.org
/education/
The Turkish
parliament voted on
August 3, 2002, to
abolish the death
penalty (except in
time of war) in a
bid to meet one of
the main criteria for
the country’s
admission to the
European Union. In
the same spirit,
another law was
voted granting
cultural rights to the
Kurds, who account
for 12 million of the
country’s 60 million
citizens. “This
courageous decision
shows that the EU
is right in being
firm as regards
human rights and
the protection of
minorities,” said
Günter Verheugen,
the commissioner
responsible for EU
enlargement. “Our
position is starting
to pay off.” 
In March 2002, 124
persons in Turkey
were on death row,
while 1,467 other
cases were pending
according to a study
by the NGO
Together against the
Death Penalty.
Within the Council
of Europe, Russia
and Armenia are the
only two countries
that have yet to
abolish the death
penalty.
“Community Voice”
is the name of the
latest project from
Echo des Ondes
Libres (which
means Free
Airwaves Echo), an
association of 60
local radio stations
from 30 African
countries. The
project was
launched in
September 2002 to
produce a guide to
setting up
community radio
stations in French-
speaking Africa and
to create a
programme
distribution
network. In
exchange for a
satellite dish, the 23
radio stations
involved undertake
to provide part of
their monthly
programme output
on health,
education and
agriculture. These
are then re-
broadcast across the
continent via the
French-language
educational channel
of the Inter-
governmental
French language
Agency.

### 127875: Talking to Joseph Stiglitz: the subtle truth about globalization

Joseph Stiglizt
The subtle truth about 
globalization
He is the hero of the anti-globalization movement and the nemesis of 
market fundamentalists. “Joe” Stiglitz, the controversial winner of the Nobel Prize 
for Economics finds the world “unfair” and wants to change it
In your latest book Globalization and
its Discontents you affirm that
globalization doesn’t work. Why?
 Because globalization doesn’t
work for the benefit of everybody,
even if some people and, in certain
parts of the world, many people, have
benefited from it. China and many
other Asian countries have increased
their exports. But in Latin America
the reforms of the 1990s have
resulted in instability. In many cases
growth has been very limited and the
benefits have gone disproportionately
to the rich. 
Do you think the crisis affecting
financial markets in rich countries is
linked to a dysfunctioning of
globalization?
 Yes and no. The problem is not
globalization itself but the
international economic institutions,
particularly the IMF that pushed a set
of ideas, like market fundamentalism,
a particular view of capitalism seen
as the best possible economic system,
the only economic system. The
troubles and recent scandals in the
United States and elsewhere have
shown that there are some very
serious problems with American-style
capitalism. Secondly, it illustrates the
link between politics and economics.

### 127875: Talking to Joseph Stiglitz: the subtle truth about globalization

And this political link can be a
problem even in the US and
industrialized countries. When I was
on the Council of Economic Advisers
in the White House, we supported
initiatives to change the accounting
standards for executives’ stock
options. But Treasury, the financial
community, the corporations resisted
and succeeded in postponing the
reforms for another eight years at
great cost to the American economy. 
Which specific interests does
liberalization serve in the West?
 It does not serve only the
interests of some people in the West
but special interests within the
Northern and Southern countries. For
example, globalization of the capital
market serves the interests of
speculators and people who are
interested in pushing short-term
securities. Some of the unbalanced
trade rules, such as the intellectual
property regime, are pushed by drug
companies and the entertainment
industry over the interests of the
broader scientific community, over
those who are concerned by the
health and care of the very poor. 
But you don’t believe in the
“conspiracy theory” that is popular in
Asia and in Russia. Why? 
 Conspiracy suggests that people
get together, conspire and actively co-
ordinate working together. I think
that’s wrong. What I do think is that
there are certain ways of thinking and
certain political processes. The
market fundamentalists’ ideology is a

s “I hope my book will
spark debate.” Loaded
with degrees, honors
and awards, including
the 2001 Nobel Prize for
economics, Joseph
Stiglitz has once again
achieved his goal. His
book Globalization and
Its Discontents
(published by W.W.
Norton, 2002) has
sparked often
passionate reactions the
world over. It has also
provoked some
ferocious attacks from
supporters of his bete
noire: the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
This neo-Keynsian has
not stopped denouncing
the “market fundamen-
talists” of the IMF. The
man who penetrated the
circle of global decision-
makers dared to speak
out against their “grand
hypocrisy.” In short, he
betrayed them.
Born in 1943 in Gary
(Indiana), Stiglitz is
considered to be one of
the most brilliant
economists of his
generation. During his
university studies at
Yale, Princeton, Oxford
and Stanford, where he
now teaches, he helped
to create a new
discipline: the economy
of information. In 1993
he joined the ultra-
exclusive Council of
Economic Advisers of
the White House, where
he became Bill Clinton’s
principal economic
councillor. In 1997, he
moved on to the World
Bank as chief economist
and vice president. 
But “Joe” Stiglitz hit
the first bump in his
career in 2000. In
January, he caused an
uproar by resigning,
because he considered
that the IMF did not give
him enough elbow room
to make the World Bank
slogan - “Our dream is a
world without poverty”
-a reality.

investments in a country’s future, so
they need to be given special priority.
But one has to look at how they
spend the money.
What do you think of the increasing
trend towards the privatisation of
educational services? 
 In general, it can represent a very
dangerous trend. In the US it often
serves to enhance segregation, not so
much racial segregation today but
social segregation. The private
schools often have better results
because in many cases their students
come from better backgrounds, with
better home education and so forth.
There’s a general belief in the power
of ICTs to reduce the economic gap
between rich and poor? What do you
think?
 The new technologies have the
power to reduce the gap between the
rich and the poor when the poor are
rich enough to avail themselves of
these new technologies. In countries
like China it is almost sure that they
will shorten the gap. But in Africa,
where there is almost no access to
NT, it would have the effect of
increasing the gap. 
Is it in the economic interest of the
poor countries to develop their own
intellectual property laws to protect
their assets (their biodiversity for
example) or is it better for them to let
the piracy of western products grow
as it is doing now?
 It is very important for them to
develop their own legal framework to
protect themselves against bio-piracy.
The problem right now is that it is an
unfair game because the developing
countries do not have the legal
resources to combat the expensive
American lawyers who work for the
firms engaged in this kind of activity.
It is critical for developing countries
to get together to have a concerted
Excerpts from 
Globalization and Its Discontents
“As I moved to the
international arena, I
discovered that […]
the decisions were made on
the basis of what seemed
a curious blend of ideology
and bad economics, dogma
that sometimes seemed to be
thinly veiling special
interests.”
“Today, few defend the
hypocrisy of pretending to
help developing countries by
forcing them to open up their
markets to the goods of the
advanced industrial countries
while keeping their own
markets protected, policies
that make the rich richer and
the poor more impoverished
– and increasingly angry.”
Speaking of the IMF: “The
change in mandate and
objectives, while it may have
been quiet, was hardly subtle:
from serving global economic
interests to serving the
interests of the global
finance.”
“The colonial mentality – the
certainty of knowing better
than developing countries
what is best for them -
persisted.”
“Globalization today is not
working for many of the
world’s poor. It is not working
for much of the environment.
It is not working for the
stability of the global
economy.”
In your book, you insist on the
tremendous impact that a good
education policy can have on
development.
 I would distinguish very strongly
between the position of the World
Bank and the position of the IMF.
The World Bank actually supports
educational projects in many
countries around the world. I saw
some very successful education
programmes first hand for instance in
Colombia, where they developed a
curriculum that facilitated migrant
workers’ children. In Ethiopia they
were thinking very hard how to
redesign a curriculum to reflect the
needs of people in that country. On
the other hand, quite often, the
austerity measures imposed as part of
the IMF programmes, undermine
education. The question is: are the
austerity programmes excessively
austere? From what I saw in Ethiopia
I can say very clearly that they were.
Educational expenditures are
very strong force, the political interest
in campaign contributions of the
financial community is a very strong
force. The problem is with the
political process, which is in many
ways undemocratic. It’s not
transparent and the voices of
particular countries and of particular
groups are more valuable than others. 
What is the impact of globalization in
the fields of education, culture and
knowledge sharing? 
 New technologies can support
cultural diversity by making it easier
for communities to express
themselves. But globalization has
sometimes been pushed too fast and
in an inappropriate way, threatening
the stability of existing cultures.
Many societies have traditional ways
of handling social support, but
sometimes international institutions
have come in with assistance
programmes that undermine those
local systems.

round of trade negotiations, to say
“we have to revise the intellectual
property regime”. 
You are convinced that globalization
could be a force for the good of the
poor. What kind of changes are
needed to meet this goal?
 There has to be recognition,
particularly in the North, of the
nature of the inequities and of the
nature of the problems. I think the
majority of people in the North
believe in principles of equity and
fairness. If they become aware of
some of these issues they will begin
to put political pressures on their
governments to do something. That’s
the explanation for the Jubilee 2000
movement for debt forgiveness. But
there have to be longer-term
institutional reforms in international
economic institutions. 
What reforms would you introduce?
 I would change the voting
distribution because when one

business come in

local competitors,

ambitions of the

country, that is the US, has a veto
power it is inevitable that the IMF is
going to reflect the interests of the
US. And when the US is represented
by the US treasury it is inevitable that
interests within the financial market
are going to be heard more loudly. I
would also change the representation.
If the IMF was only engaged in
technical matters like insurance,
nobody would care that it is done by
the financial community. But IMF
policy is about education, health,
every aspect of society. And those
people who are affected have no
voice, absolutely no voice.
What would you do now in Argentina
for example?
 First, I would change from
focusing on trying to get foreign
money, which just goes into paying
foreign debts, and ask: “what can I
do inside the country? What is the
problem?” The problem is that
human resources, for example, are
not being used. How to get them to
be used? What you need is a market,
demand and working capital for the
firms, to get the system going again
instead of paying foreign creditors. I
would try to cultivate a special
arrangement on a temporary basis
with all of my trading partners so
that they would take more of my
goods and that they would provide
firms with working capital. It is all
about restarting the engine.

### 127889: Feast and famine for world heritage

When UNESCO’s General
Conference adopted the
Convention Concerning the Protection of the
World Cultural and Natural Heritage on
November 16, 1972, the event went largely
unnoticed. Rather, interest in UNESCO that
year was focused on the spectacular salvaging
of the Philae temples in Egypt. Yet, 30 years
on, the Convention stands as one of the
Organization’s greatest achievements: it has
been ratified by 175 states, of which
125 boast properties on the World Heritage
List. Tourists flock to these star destinations,
comprising 730 sites “of outstanding universal
value.” 
“It’s an unquestionable success,” says Léon
Pressouyre, a cultural advisor to UNESCO who
has followed world heritage protection for 25
years. He points to the “important evolution in
the philosophy of the Convention, which at
first, merely took up the old idea of ‘the



heritage
wonders of the world’.” For a long time, this
meant that a “monumental” vision of sites
prevailed, in line with the aesthetics of western
art.
It is hardly surprising then, that historic city
centres and religious buildings, especially
Christian ones, are over-represented. A revision
of criteria in 1994 led to the recognition of new
types of properties, more attuned to the cultures
of developing countries. Cultural landscapes
and non-built sacred sites are prime examples,
such as the rice terraces of the Philippines or
the Maoris’ sacred volcanoes in New Zealand.
Despite these adjustments, Africa, Oceania
and to a lesser extent Asia and Latin America
are given short shrift by the List (see table). Of
the 175 State Parties to the Convention, 50 still
have no properties on the List. Furthermore, in
some States, heritage that is not considered
“culturally correct” is ignored: sites of
marginalized minorities or monuments
testifying to periods deemed inglorious like the
12th century Castle of the Knights in Syria are
not given adequate recognition. “The current
list is not yet representative of the heritage of
humanity,” says Pressouyre, who considers that
the 1972 Convention has widened the gap
between North and South. “The problem is very
difficult to resolve,” admits Francesco Bandarin,
the director of the World Heritage Centre,
“because there is no self-regulation.” Tempted
by the tourism windfall, states compete to

nominate as many sites as possible, which has
led to inflation in the number of properties
inscribed over the past decade. But poor
countries are severely handicapped by the lack
the funds and expertise needed to put together
their applications for nominations and to
safeguard their heritage. To limit the lead taken
by heritage “champions” such as Spain (36
sites), Italy (35 sites) and China (28), the World
Heritage Committee, an inter-governmental
body that meets annually to approve new
additions to the List, decided that only one site
per country and year would be accepted from
2003.
A LACK OF RESOURCES 
AND SANCTIONS
Lack of resources also looms when it comes to
protecting sites endangered by war, natural
catastrophes, pollution, urbanization, pillaging,
tourism and other threats. With a budget of four
million dollars per year and five million in extra-
budgetary resources, the Centre cannot be
present on all fronts. Recent initiatives to
mobilize funds from non-governmental partners
and to encourage twinning projects between sites
in the North and South attempt to bridge the gap.
Lack of money, however, cannot be invoked
every time states fail to fulfil their obligations.

But what is UNESCO doing?
This is a time of worry for lovers
of  Islamic Cairo, a site inscribed
on the World Heritage List in
1979. The most virulent critics
claim that authorities are waging
a “disastrous” restoration
campaign in a quarter packed
with some 600 historic
monuments. The first phase of
work began about three years
ago. Endowed with a $19 million
budget, the plan focused on
47 monuments out of the total
157 targeted by the campaign.
“It’s time to stop the massacre,”
rails the Egyptian Saïd Zulficar,
secretary general of the French
NGO Patrimoine sans frontières
(Heritage without borders) and a
former UNESCO official.
“Under the guise of restoration,
the culture ministry pays
public construction companies
with no experience to restore
monuments over 1,000 years old,
as if they were simply run-down
apartment buildings.” 
The controversy has attracted
extensive press coverage ever
since some 30 Islamic art experts
sent a petition to the first lady
Suzanne Mubarak on June 8,
2001. They protested against the
violation of international norms
regarding world heritage
conservation and the use of
inappropriate materials like
cement. Critics also denounced
plans to push out the
neighbourhood’s small trades in
order to create a type of open-air
museum aimed at tourists.
Furious Egyptian officials insist
that they are struggling to save
an extremely degraded site from
falling into ruin, especially after
the 1992 earthquake. In August
2001, an expert mission
dispatched by UNESCO
recognized these considerable
efforts while underscoring in its
report the mediocre quality of
work undertaken on certain sites.

Cambodia: manna that doesn't come cheap
Krack Chi, who wears a red
and white krama around
his waist, has a remarkable
tattoo across his entire
chest. “They're the temples
at Angkor,” he says.
“They're magical
drawings.” The 51-year-old
chief of Sra Srong North, a
village near the site's most
visited monuments,
explains that the tattoo
protected him from both
the Khmer Rouge and stray
bullets. Today, it still brings
him good luck. The lives of
the 144 families in his
village “changed a bit
because of tourism,” which
has boomed since the
site's inscription on
UNESCO's World Heritage
List in 1992. From 1993 to
2001, the number of
foreigners visiting Angkor
jumped from 7,638 to
239,091.
The residents of Sra Srong
don't always have
electricity, but nine of every
10 children go to the
village’s new school, built
in 1999, according to Krack
Chi. Some of the older
villagers who “know
things” about the temples
have become guides, and
youths sell souvenirs or
drinks. “With the money,
people buy rice and
necessities for their
homes.”
But what the village chief
fails to mention is that this
manna comes at a price –
the explosion in the sexual
exploitation of women and
children. In Cambodia,
some 30 percent of
prostitutes – male and
female – are between the
ages of 12 and 17. In
recent years, the Khmer
empire, especially the
region around Angkor, has
become a choice travel
destination for pedophiles
from around the world.
According to a study
conducted in 2001 by the
non-governmental
organization World Vision,
more than 70 percent of
children polled in and
around Angkor admitted
foreign tourists had
solicited them for sex.
One of every five tourists
in Cambodia is there
looking for sex, the NGO
says. But foreigners are
not the only ones to blame
for the prostitution boom –
it's primarily fed by local
demand.

“The Convention does not really foresee
sanctioning mechanisms when the integrity of
properties is not respected,” explains Henry
Cleere, of the International Council on
Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS). The only
available option is to remove them from the
List, a measure the World Heritage Committee
has never taken. Attempts at reform are met
with iron resistance. “States parties have
actually taken a step backwards since 1992,”
regrets Minja Yang, the deputy director of the
World Heritage Centre. Back then, they accepted
that in cases of emergency, a threatened site
could be declared “in danger” without the
consent of the state concerned. Today, more
than ever bound to their “sovereignty,” states
oppose this measure, which would authorize
the international community to attempt to save
what can be. As a result, the List of World
Heritage in Danger counts only 33 sites, even
though dozens of other highly threatened ones
continue to be damaged without any action  to
safeguard them. “I have in mind a black list of
some 20 sites that are in very poor condition
and should be removed from the list,” affirms
Cleere.
“In 1979, when Kathmandu (Nepal) was
inscribed on the World Heritage List, it was a
small paradise,” recalls Bandarin. “Twenty years
later, two million people have crowded into the
valley and an anarchic conurbation has
destroyed this paradise. What can we do in
such cases?”

Protecting
a paradise
Located in the Pacific Ocean
about 1,000 kilometres off the
coast of Ecuador, the Galapagos
Archipelago was one of the first
sites inscribed on the World
Heritage List in 1978. Six years
later, it became a Biosphere
Reserve, and in December 2001,
the World Heritage Committee
extended the site to include the
Marine Reserve, a 64-kilometre
area off the coast.
All these measures make the
19 volcanic islands that inspired
Charles Darwin’s theory of
evolution by natural selection
one of the most protected sites
on earth. Investment continues
to shepherd the protection
process: the Inter-American
Development Bank and the
Global Environment Facility
have respectively allocated
$13 million and $18.3 million
to Strategy 2010 for the
Sustainable Development of the
Islands, a plan encompassing
measures to conserve marine
and terrestrial biodiversity,
control invasive species, and
promote human development
and capacity building.  
In the Galapagos, these
moves are not to everyone’s
liking. Shortly before the site
was expanded to include the
marine zone, Ecuadorian
president Gustavo Noboa
travelled to the Islands in an
attempt to quell the fears of
fishermen who feared that
excessive protection would cut
into their income.
Tour operators, meanwhile,
have welcomed the strategy
and seized upon the occasion to
demand more flights to the
Islands, currently served by no
more than one or two per week.
According to figures from the
Galapagos National Park
Service, 77,570 tourists visited
the archipelago in 2001 – 10,000
more than the previous year.
Currently standing at 18,000,
the number of permanent
residents is also on the rise.
Attracted by potential revenue,
a growing number of people
are emigrating from the
mainland to one of the four
inhabited islands.
While over-fishing of species
like lobster, shark and sea
cucumber threatens the site,
“one of the main conservation
problems is the introduction of
invasive species that are alien
to the ecosystem, like wild cats,
goats and pigs,” says Maria
Fernanda García, from the
environmental NGO Fundación
Natura. “These eat the local
flora and attack turtle nests.”
Protection measures were
bolstered in 1998 with the
passing of the Galapagos
Special Law, which establishes
a participatory management
committee formed by
representatives from
government, the Charles
Darwin Foundation (created in
1959 and invested with “full
ecological powers”), local
inhabitants, fishermen and tour
operators. “Obviously there are
conflicts of interest, especially
when the fishing season opens
and quotas are set for different
species,” admits Paola Díaz of
the Darwin Foundation. “But
the body sets up a process for
collective negotiation. It’s
recognized as such by all
partners and considered a
model, including at the regional
level.”

The monuments of Kazan
are the result of multiple
influences, especially
Tatar and Russian,
Christian and Muslim.
Located in the capital of
Tatarstan (Russian
Federation), the  Kazan
Kremlin was inscribed on
the World Heritage List in
2000. The city’s mayor,
Kamil Isxakov, explains the
impact.
“Since our site was
inscribed on the List, we’ve
moved into the global
cultural arena. We now
benefit from international
recognition and various
forms of solidarity. For
example, we are now
eligible for subsidies which
hold a significant economic
interest for our city.
“Through international
seminars and UNESCO
networks, inhabitants and
site managers have
learned about experiences
carried out in other historic
cities, enabling them to
resolve problems more
easily. Slowly, confidence
has set in and tourism is
developing.
“But the fact that we are
now submitted to a form of
control by UNESCO has
not pleased everyone.
Some city representatives
complain about constraints
regarding the conservation
of monuments. Reconciling
heritage conservation and
urban expansion is no easy
job. Also, the restoration of
Kazan’s historic centre has
incurred considerable
expense. As part of our
conservation plan, 131
historic and cultural
monuments are slated for
restoration.
“We are also setting up
the biggest programme in
Russia to improve
dilapidated housing. When
we have to move families,
we provide them with free
accommodation in the new
areas of the city. Overall,
Kazan’s inhabitants
support the projects
underway, even if some
are inconvenienced by new
problems such as housing,
transportation or
communications.”

The World Heritage List counts only 144 natural sites, 
against 563 cultural ones. Why this imbalance?
■ “We shouldn’t let figures mislead us. Natural sites on the
World Heritage List actually cover a much greater surface
area than cultural ones. That being said, it’s true that the
latter far outnumber natural sites, for several reasons.
Cultural specificities are easier to identify and to locate than
outstanding natural spaces. Also, members of the World
Heritage Committee who decide on new inscriptions tend to
be from countries with a predominantly cultural heritage.
Then, more applications are filed for the nomination of
cultural properties: most natural sites are located in
developing countries which present fewer nominations than
developed ones”(see main article).
The World Conservation Union has a significant say on the
inscription of natural sites. It appears to take a stricter
approach than ICOMOS1, responsible for evaluating cultural
properties. Why?
■ “Generally, it is more difficult to prepare a credible
management plan for a tropical forest, for example, than for a
monument, chiefly because the surface area involved is so
vast. This is reinforced by the fact that many natural sites are
located in resource-strapped developing countries. As a
result, we sometimes recommend that a nomination be
postponed.”

increasingly common for international rivers the
world over. Yet the negotiations never get below
the surface to reach another resource that
thirsty nations increasingly compete for:
groundwater. 
More than half the world’s population
depends on water that is pumped from the pore
spaces of rock formations, known as aquifers,
which lie hidden beneath the Earth’s crust.
These formations can span thousands of
kilometers and contain enough water to satisfy
all of humanity’s demands for many decades.
Imagine filling a pool the size of Germany,
several hundred metres deep with some of the
purest water in the world, to grasp the
dimensions of the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer
(see box), for example, which lies under the
desert sand of Libya, Egypt, Chad and Sudan.
Despite its phenomenal supplies of water, you
won’t find a trace of this aquifer’s existence on
a standard map. Aquifers of all shapes and sizes
are zigzagging across borders around the world,
often unbeknown to the national leaders on the
ground.  
To better understand this mysterious global
capital, geohydrologists from every country in
the world are starting to draw up the first global
inventory and map of transboundary aquifers,
through a UNESCO project entitled
Internationally Shared Aquifer Resources
(ISARM), which involves several organizations,
notably the International Association of
Hydrologists, the Food and Agricultural
Organization and the United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe. Within six years, the
project will map and assess the water quantity
and quality of every aquifer shared by two or
more countries in the world. The database will
also provide detailed case studies and a
“toolbox” of innovative techniques for
managing these precious resources from a
technical, socio-economic and legal perspective. 
Like rivers, aquifers pay no heed to national
borders. Unlike rivers, little is known about the
water they contain. Substantial investment and
Sadat, in 1979, in response to plans to build
dams by drought-stricken Ethiopia. Despite the
fact that no military force in the world has ever
managed to “capture” a river basin and that the
only full-fledged “war over water” dates back
4,500 years ago in Mesopotamia, the threat still
echoes today. Indeed Ethiopia is preparing to
tap the Nile, thanks largely to the World Bank,
which is dangling packages of financial
assistance to lure the riparian states, especially
Egypt, to the negotiating table. This kind of

scientific expertise is required just to map the
boundaries of an aquifer before beginning to
accurately assess the quantity and quality of
water it contains. Sometimes the aquifer is fed
or “recharged” by recent rains seeping down
through the soil. Others, like the Nubian,
contain the rain of bygone geological eras,
known as “fossil water”, which can be
thousands and even millions of years old. 
THE RACE
TO THE PUMP HOUSE
Aquifers can be political dynamite. States are
already reluctant to admit that they must share
the waters of international rivers. But even the
most recalcitrant government finds it difficult to
deny the existence of a river flowing across its
border. But when that water is invisible,
percolating slowly deep underground, there is
an undeniable temptation to put one’s ’head in
the sand’ and pump the shared resource
without consulting a neighbour. The growing
body of international rules and conventions
concerning rivers don’t apply to aquifers,
prompting experts like UNESCO’s Alice Aureli to
fear a “race to the pump house” in which
countries scramble to use as much water as
possible out of fear that a more powerful
neighbour will dominate an aquifer by virtue of
its financial and technical strength.
For example, in the dusty borderland between
Mexico and the US, both governments were
simmering this summer, threatening and
accusing one another over the dwindling
supplies of the Columbia River. Yet neither side
could simply do as it liked because of a formal
treaty to share the river. Aquifers straddle that
very same stretch of border, yet not a single
agreement is in place to share them. So
communities like Columbus (New Mexico, US)
and Puerto Palomas (Chihuahua, Mexico) rely
exclusively on the same aquifer system, known
as the Mimbres. By pumping more and more
water - 95 percent of which is used for
agriculture - both communities risk their future.  
To defuse this potential for conflict, ISARM
brings together geohydrologists from the major
regions to jointly study their shared resources.
The survey of Africa, now being finalized, has
revealed several major discoveries. Prior to this
project, there was practically no documentation
of transboundary aquifers in the continent.
Groundwater studies  are sorely lacking, despite
the fact that some countries, like Mauritania,
rely upon the resource for 80 percent of their
needs. Even in  humid countries, like Nigeria,
many communities have no choice but to pump
underground because of terrible pollution of
rivers or surface waters. And when drought
hits, a properly managed aquifer can serve as a
kind of water bank, tiding over communities
until rains return. Yet there is one major
problem: pollution. It is extremely difficult, if
not impossible, to clean an aquifer once it has
been contaminated by sewage or chemicals
seeping down from communities, factories and
farms. 
The African survey has mapped about 20
transboundary aquifers, five of which had never
been identified before. For example,

geohydrologists from Benin learned that the
aquifer providing water for the capital city,
Cotonou, extends across the border into Togo.
Both countries now plan to jointly manage the
aquifer, which will come under increasing strain
because of predicted climate change. Rainfall in
the region is already declining at a rate of two
millimeters per year, according to Félix V.
Azonsi, director of the Water Resources
Department of Benin. In another surprise
development, geohydrologists from Ghana
discovered that their country shares a major
aquifer with Côte D’Ivoire. 
Similar surveys have already been completed
for South America, Western Europe and the
Euro-Mediterranean region, where water
conflicts can be explosive. The Mountain
Aquifer, for example, which straddles the West
Bank and Israel, lies at the heart of the water
dispute between the Palestinian Authority and
the Israeli government. In a nutshell, Israel

Libya’s Great Man-Made River
Data-exchange is just the
first step in the ISARM
initiative, which aims to set
up projects and
commissions to jointly
manage shared aquifers.
The ultimate goal is to
broker legal agreements to
further protect the aquifers.
This is the case for the
Nubian Sandstone Aquifer,
which spans Libya, Egypt,
Chad and Sudan. The
Nubian consists of four
aquifers, which roughly
contain about 120,000 cubic
kilometres of fossil water,
thousands and perhaps
millions of years old. This is
the liquid legacy of a
bygone era, when the
barren Sahara was a lush
savannah. The rains that fed
the region disappeared
some 3,000 years ago,
leaving phenomenal but
finite water supplies, which
the Libyan government
began mining in 1991
through the world’s largest
civil engineering project.
The Great Man-Made River
project delivers about half a
million cubic metres of
water a day to Libya’s
coastal cities (where the
population lives) through a
network of concrete pipes,
four metres in diameter or
the size of subway tunnels.
This “river” lies hidden
under the desert and covers
a total length of 3,500 km. 
Considerable controversy
surrounds the mining of
fossil water and several
environmental groups have
condemned the Man-Made
River. The project’s
supporters maintain that
countries like Libya have
run out of renewable water
and cannot solely rely upon
the costly option of
desalination. ISARM is now
establishing international
guidelines to manage this
extremely rare resource.
The challenge is to balance
ethical, environmental and
scientific concerns with the
socio-economic needs of
the current generation and
those to follow.
For example, many
experts justify the use of
fossil water for drinking
needs but consider it
unethical and economically
wasteful to use such a
precious resource for
irrigation, especially
in arid zones where half
the water can be lost to
evaporation.

### 127879: Our hidden hydro-capital

consumes about 85 percent of the yield even
though most of the rain and surface water
replenishing it originates in Palestinian territory.
However, geological conditions make it
extremely difficult and expensive to tap into this
water on the Palestinian side. In fact, most of
the good quality water naturally flows into
Israel, where it is relatively easy to access. The
Mountain Aquifer had been the subject of
intense negotiations, which collapsed after the
outbreak of the current intifadah.  Despite the
violence, geohydrologists from both sides met
earlier this year and exchanged water-related
data through ISARM. The meeting was in many
ways symbolic—both sides are fully aware of
the pressures straining the Mountain Aquifer.
But by taking part in ISARM, they sent a critical
message: the goal is not just to study a
transboundary aquifer, but to share and protect
a resource no-one can live without.

A profession
in crisis
Relentless population growth and
declining working conditions are creating
a severe shortage of teachers in the
world’s classrooms, which may lead
to a slide in educational standards
according to a new global survey of
teaching conditions 
“Teaching? Out of the question.” For
Jerome Damien, a 27-year-old Parisian “teaching is too hard.
Teachers are expected to fill roles fhey are not trained for.
It’s also a profession with limited career possibilities, and
early burn-out. And the pay is lousy given the job’s
demands.” Jerome’s attitude is shared by 16 year-old
Franco-Australian student Raphaëlle Prikosh who would
“never, never” consider becoming a teacher. “Have you seen
how kids and parents treat teachers these days?” she adds.
The attitudes of Jerome and Raphaëlle are shared by
growing numbers of young people in the rich North, who’re
seeking more lucrative, exciting jobs, and consider teaching
as a profession of last resort.
In the developing countries of the South, the reasons are
different, but the teaching profession is equally in trouble.

where there are
some 70 primary-age
children for every
teacher in the
country and
classrooms of up to
100 pupils
classrooms with as many as 100 students per teacher in
some developing countries. 
At the same time, the survey showed that in industrialized
countries, an aging teaching force and a dearth of new
recruits discouraged by declining status and low pay
threatens to diminish the quality of education, just at a time
when the need for new knowledge and skills is growing
dramatically. 
The number of women teachers increased throughout the
1990s, but still remains well under 50 percent of the total in
many countries in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia,
where the presence of more women teachers could help
increase the access of girls to schooling. The report notes
that the “glass ceiling” remains a reality for women in the
profession who’re still seriously under-represented in
management jobs.
The Statistical Profile of the Teaching Profession, looks at
how many teachers there are, who they are and what
training they have received, their working conditions and
how much their governments invest in them. It clearly links
the status of teachers with the quality of education: in those
countries where teachers enjoy relatively good employment
conditions, education tends to be given high priority and is
of higher quality. 
The data, drawn from a range of sources, show that a
concerted effort has been made in many developing regions
where two thirds of the world’s 59 million teachers live and
work. The number of primary teachers in these countries
increased by almost nine percent between 1990 and 1995.
But the population of primary school age children there rose
by the same amount.
At secondary level, the number of teachers grew
substantially faster than the secondary school age
population in developing countries (14.3 percent and
6.0 percent respectively). In the Least Developed Countries
(LDCs) the difference was much less marked (16.4 percent
and 13.9 percent). However, the study notes that almost half
(228 million) of the total youth population of secondary
school age in these countries is out of school. As more of
these young people get into school, demand for teachers
will increase dramatically. 
Young people are still becoming teachers, but the number of
new recruits to the job cannot keep up with population
growth, and, especially in Africa, the profession is being
decimated by AIDS and conflict. 
Unless something is done quickly to turn the situation
around, say the experts, the world will have to deal with an
acute teacher shortage at a time when demand for
education is growing exponentially.
Such are the conclusions of a survey published by
UNESCO and the International Labour Office, released on
October 5 (World Teachers’ Day). Based on the most
extensive set of data ever gathered on the teaching
profession, the survey found that the growth in the number
of school-aged children had outpaced the growth in the
number of teachers worldwide in the 1990s, packing

Such growth means that the ratio of pupils to teachers
remains three times higher in the LDCs than in developed
countries.  In Benin, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo,
Gabon, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique and Senegal, for
example, the study reports more than 50 primary-age
children and often as many as 70 for every teacher in the
overall population. This compares with an average of
16 pupils for every teacher in developed countries. 
Developing country teachers also tend to be very young
and inexperienced. In many of these nations more than
30 percent of teachers are under 30 years of age: in
Indonesia, the under 30s account for more than 52 percent of
primary school teachers. Although most teachers have the
national academic qualifications to do their job, these
qualifications vary widely, and in many of the LDCs the
majority of primary teachers have, at most, a lower secondary
qualification, and frequently no professional training at all.
This is the case for almost 50 percent of teachers in Uganda,
40 percent in Togo and some 35 percent in Cape Verde.
The rich countries are also facing a difficult future.
Although there seem to be plenty of teachers, the majority of
them are older. In Germany and Sweden for example, more
than 70 percent of primary teachers are over 40. This means
that the majority of teachers in developed countries received
their initial training 15 to 20 years ago, but the knowledge
and skills needed by students has changed dramatically since

Teachers’ Rights and Responsibilities 
In 1966 UNESCO and the
International Labour
Organization adopted the
Recommendation
concerning the status of
teachers. The
recommendation covers all
school teachers from pre-
primary to  secondary level
whether in private or public
institutions, providing
definitions of their
responsibilities and rights. It
can also be used as the
basis for the development
of a code of ethics for the
teaching profession, or for
the development of national
laws and practices
concerning teachers.
Some of its key provisions
include:
Professionalism:
“Teaching should be regard
as a professon : it is a form
of public service which
requires teachers or expert
knowledge and specialized
skills, acquired and
maintained through
rigorous and continuing
study; it also calls for a
sense of personal and
corporate sense of
responsibility for the
education and welfare of
the pupils in their charge.”
Rights: “Both salaries and
working conditions for
teachers should be
determined through a
process of negotiation
between teachers’
organizations and the
employers of teachers.”
Hours of work: “In fixing
hours of teaching account
should be taken of all
factors which are relevant to
the teachers work load”.
Salaries: “Teacher salaries
should (a) reflect the
importance to society of the
teaching function and hence
the importance of teachers
as well as the
responsibilities of all kinds
which fall upon them from
the time of their entry into
service […] (d) take account
of the fact that certain posts
require higher qualifications
and experience and carry
greater responsibilities.”

then. The report notes that
in-service training is offered
in many countries, but
questions its quality and
relevance.
Research indicates that low salaries may be partly
responsible for lack of new recruits: teachers with 15 years
experience in the OECD countries for example, earn an
average of US$27,525 annually, or significantly less than
equally qualified professionals in other fields.  This is still
several times the earnings of teachers in developing
countries, where salaries fell steadily throughout the 1990s.
In Peru, all teachers, regardless of the level they teach or
their experience, earn little more than US$4,700 a year.
The report analyses the trade-offs made by governments to
maximize the efficiency of their education systems. In some
countries, such as Peru, teachers’ low salaries are partly
compensated by a relatively light teaching load of about 648
hours annually. In the Philippines, teachers are paid more
(about $US10,640 annually), but work an average of 1,176
hours per year and teach classes of over 50 students.
Juggling these various elements is obviously a complex
task, especially for poor countries. But getting the balance
right is vital for building and maintaining a professional
teaching corps.

Drugs: societies under  
Guajara Mirim! Until the 1970s, it
was the end of the line for
a train (powered by a wood-burning engine)
known as the “Devil’s Railway”, an Amazon
line that could have rivalled the tragically
famous Congo-Ocean line for the number of
workers killed per number of sleepers or ties
put down. The train, which was never linked to
the rest of Brazil’s rail network nor to that of
Bolivia  (on the other side of the Mamore river),
was ordered out of service by the military,
which preferred roads and independent truck
drivers to the rails and unionized railway
workers.
Guajara Mirim and its only hotel, The
Jamaica, are not on the edge of the world but

Rondônia. From there, you can take a boat –
called a voadeira – to go to its equally rundown
sister city of Guayaramerim in Bolivia. You can

including the 300 litres of petrol you’ll need –

reservation and see hundreds of jacarés, local
alligators, but practically no inhabitants. The
ribereños, traditional inhabitants of the Amazon
river banks, have moved to the cities,
abandoning the area to drug traffickers and
police officers who, with binoculars glued to
their eyes, try to keep watch over the river, a
river that forms a border but which is also the
sole means of communication in the region.
It was in Guajara Mirim that the Machado
family arrived from Lima in the 1970s. One of
the Machado brothers, Nereu, started off as a
simple worker on the struggling barge that
carried goods from one side of the river to the
other. Five or six years later, the same man
owned not only the barge but a shipping
company, a naval shipyard, the dredging
company that had a stranglehold on the local
market for sand and gravel used in
construction, as well as the supermarket and
the petrol pump in Guajara Mirim, four planes
and dozens of farms – with runways – in the
region and elsewhere. Building his networks on
both sides of the river by currying favors,
feeding corruption and sparking terror, Nereu
became a major drug trafficker as well as a
local force.
A “MIRACLE” STATE
Another trafficker in Rondônia, Jabes Rabelo,
climbed even higher up the social ladder, getting
himself elected to the federal parliament. From
humble beginnings as a mere official for INCRA,
the body tasked with managing settlement
projects, Rabelo became a coffee buyer in Cacoal
and in the 1980s launched the “coffee miracle”.
Rabelo bought coffee bean harvests at a better
price than his competitors and then resold them
at a loss in other Brazilian states. His local
competitors ended up either going out of
business or becoming part of Rabelo’s operation.
In reality, the “miracle” should have been called
money laundering: Rabelo’s bad business deals
allowed him to “clean” the money he earned
from cocaine trafficking and another illegal
activity, a vast car and truck theft network
(vehicles were traded in Bolivia for drugs).
Rondônia state was also witness to other
“miracles”, like the “toilet paper boom”: this
precious household necessity flew off store
shelves in Guajana Mirim by the cubic metre
and ended up in secret laboratories, which use s
lots of filters. In Costa Marques, rice was the
hot commodity, filling entire warehouses – and
the pockets of  local shopkeepers – before sales
fell off, ruining those who had been made rich.
Money laundering was hidden in the sales of
coffee, precious wood and gold extracted from
local rivers.

same causes do not produce the same effects in
Mumbai (Bombay), India, where local
trafficking is “better organized”, meaning it is
better controlled by organized crime groups
who reach agreements on sharing markets and
turf. Another observation: “Everywhere, young
people, and, more and more, very young people
are the first victims, in a general context of
poverty, unemployment and social
marginalisation where …  young people are
tempted to get to money to buy consumer
goods by engaging in illegal activities.” 
Part of the report is devoted to the cultural
and social aspects of drug trafficking. The
reader can learn, among other things, how in
India, traditional use of some drugs (opium
and cannabis), as well as religious, social and
medical use, was once controlled by the local
community, but those controls have now
disappeared since all drug use has been made
illegal. Or how in Mexico, the drug trafficker
has been incorporated into local folklore,
becoming a character in the corridos, popular
traditional oral history, as well as being used in
idiomatic expressions and local symbols.
The example of Rondônia state says a lot
about the interconnectedness of the drug
economy with other sectors, about the links
between several forms of criminal activity (in
this case, drugs and car theft) as well as about
the power of drug traffickers and their ability to
infiltrate the ranks of those tasked with making
laws. This is only one of numerous cases
analyzed in the report published by UNESCO in
August, entitled The Economic and Social
Transformations Connected to the International
Drug Problem (see box).
Until now, research conducted on the drug
phenomenon has been mainly devoted to the
problems caused by consumption, as well as
prevention and treatment policies. Moreover,
drug trafficking, as impenetrable as it is
dangerous, was a subject that seemed destined
to remain outside research circles. However, it is
now much more important to have a better
understanding of the profound effects trafficking
had on economies and societies when it shot
through the roof in the 1980s and 1990s, and of
the involvement of huge criminal organizations
now active in all corners of the globe.
CORRUPTION IS EVERYWHERE
One of the most serious problems posed by drug
trafficking, and illustrated by states’ lack of
ability and/or willingness to apply laws to
crackdown on the situation, is the problem of
governance, as the report clearly shows.
Impunity through corruption exists everywhere,
in various guises, according to the authors, who
write: “The form of corruption prevailing in a
given country is strictly dependent upon the
nature of the State and the balance of power
that holds between State institutions and drug
trafficking networks. In this regard, the case of
Mexico, where the civil service remained for a
long time under the de facto tutelage of a single
party, may show a greater similarity to the case
of China, than, for example, to that of Brazil or
Colombia.”
The existence of drug markets creates other
serious problems, like the violent crime that is
plaguing some large cities. In Rio de Janeiro,
“One cannot understand the tremendous
increase in violent crimes, especially homicide,
without linking it to drug trafficking.” But the

### 127883: Drugs: societies under the influence

Everything goes when it
comes to laundering drug
profits - the coffee trade,
gold or exotic timbers.

The research goes beyond this local level to
unveil the less obvious consequences of drug
trafficking -- and the money laundering that
comes along with it. It clearly establishes a link
with other criminal activities, from São Paulo
through Mumbai (Bombay) to China.
In a final observation and confirmation of the
importance of the problem, the report notes
that: “If the illegal traffic of drugs represents
only a small percentage of economic activity in
comparison to the formal legal economy,
nevertheless the money laundering of the profits
from the totality of the illegal activities
controlled by the criminal networks can have an
effect on financial crises. This theory was
proved by the Mexican financial crisis (1994-
1995), and also in Thailand (1997) and Japan
(since 1990)”
Future studies will perhaps show that this
theory applied to countries like Turkey,
Argentina or Nigeria in 2000-01.

SOS Media
On
24 January this year, just weeks after
the Taleban lost their 7-year hold on
power, the Kabul Weekly, Afghanistan’s first
independent publication in as many years, hit
the streets. This momentous and highly
symbolic event was made possible by direct
assistance provided by UNESCO as part of a
global programme to support the development
of editorially independent and non-partisan
media in areas ravaged by conflict (see box).
The 10-year-old programme, known as SOS
Media, has achieved impressive results in
Southeastern Europe, Africa and Asia.
As the media became instruments of war in
the former Yugoslavia in the early 1990s,
UNESCO sought to support non-partisan
reporting. To this end, it provided print and
broadcast journalists with equipment and
supplies, helped them communicate across lines
of fire and organize distribution. With the
World Association of Newspapers, the
International Federation of Journalists and the
Council of Europe, UNESCO helped set up the
Independent Balkan Media Coordination Centre
in Slovenia to keep track of press freedom
violations in the former Yugoslavia. Diplomatic
pressure to prevent regimes from suppressing
the nascent independent media in the region
helped the development of lively print and
broadcast media which played a crucial role in
the defeat of President Slobodan Milosevic in
the elections of 2000.
Throughout the preceding years of conflict,
UNESCO in cooperation with various NGOs
UNESCO supports independent media in conflict and post conflict areas,

helped to keep independent media alive in the
former Yugoslavia (see box ) often moving key
equipment and supplies across battle-lines. In
1995, together with World Wide Television
News (WTN), UNESCO helped to create a
Satellite News Exchange which continued to
make reliable information available to
independent television broadcasters throughout
the subsequent war years. UNESCO also
supported the creation of an Association of
Private Media (APM) which helped independent
publishers to coordinate their responses in the
face of restrictions and government-induced
shortages of material such as paper. The private
Trans Press network laboured, with UNESCO
assistance, to distribute independent
newspapers as widely as possible in a difficult
environment.
In the summer of 2002, UNESCO sent Nastasa
Vuckovic Lesendric, General Manager of APM
and of the Trans Press network in Belgrade, to
Afghanistan. Her role was to share her
considerable experience with media
professionals of that other war-ravaged country. 
PRESSURE FROM ALL SIDES
Back from her mission, Vuckovic Lesendric
outlined the challenges facing the Afghan print
media: “In just a few months, 90 different titles
were established but none are economically
viable. They must first establish the habit of
reading newspapers, which is difficult because
of very low literacy. I was shocked when one
Afghan man told me ‘I was born to be a warrior
and all I need to read is the Koran which I
already know by heart.’ Printing presses were
destroyed in the wars and there is the problem
of distribution. It is really difficult to travel
beyond Kabul, some areas are not secure and
distribution there will depend on the
cooperation of warlords who can put pressure
on publishers in terms of contents.”
Since 1994, SOS Media has been active in the
Great Lakes region of Africa. With the non-
governmental organization Reporters sans
frontières, it set up Agatashya, a radio station in
Rwanda run by independent Rwandan
journalists. It broadcast survival information on
drinking water, food and sanitation to more
than 1.5 million refugees and helped them
search for lost family members. UNESCO and
the French NGO Equilibre furthermore sent
some 3,500 radio sets to camps in the Kivu
Lake area (former Zaïre). This illustrates the
reliance of large-scale humanitarian assistance
on the media and “it is essential that the
populations concerned be able to trust the
media which disseminate vital public
service messages,” says Antonella Notari,
spokesperson for the International Committee of
the Red Cross.

September 3-5) urged the Afghan authorities to enshrine
the principles of free speech and free media in their
country’s new constitution.
The meeting was organized by the Ministry of Information
and Culture and UNESCO, with the help of the British
Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and the NGOs Internews
and Baltic Media Centre.
The final declaration issued by participants
recommended such far-reaching measures as an immediate
review of the legal system concerning the media, so as “to
promote freedom of expression, protect the rights of
journalists, and guarantee their freedom to do their work in
safety, including publishing critical reports and opinions.” 
It also asked that “licensing provisions in the Press Law
should be suspended immediately” so that “anyone can
publish newspapers and periodicals”, and called for “open
government laws” giving the public and journalists access
to information. Amongst the recommendations specifically
concerning the audiovisual media, was a call for the
transformation of Radio-Television Afghanistan into a public
service broadcasting system, with an independent board of
governors.
Finally, the declaration recommended that “these plans be
integrated as part of national policy, and that sufficient
resources be allocated within the government’s annual
budgets, supported by international donors.”
The Kabul meeting is in keeping with UNESCO’s work to
promote and develop independent media in post conflict
areas, and to advise governments on media legislation, as it
has done, for example in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzgovina,
Kosovo, and Indonesia.

The Alpine region of
Entlebuch in the canton
of Lucerne has become
Switzerland’s second
UNESCO biosphere
reserve. The site joins 139
other UNESCO Man and
Biosphere reserves in
mountain areas, out of a
total of 409 in 94
countries. With the year
2002 designated UN
International Year of the
Mountain, the Entlebuch
initiative helps focus
attention on the critical
role that mountains play
for life on this planet.
Despite initial scepticism
in Entlebuch, a high level
of involvement of local
farmers and residents in
the project has produced
a unique mix of economic
development, ecological
and cultural conservation
initiatives. Local farmers
and craftspeople can
apply for a “biosphere
reserve” quality label for
their products, a
guarantee that they have
been made in a
sustainable manner with
respect for the
environment. This kind of
“eco-labelling” is
becoming an increasingly
popular way to promote
sustainable local
development while
raising awareness about
conservation and good
practice.

on all continents. Most have
designed specific curricula
on human rights rewarded
by diplomas as well as
modules for students from
other disciplines. Other
chairs offer training for
professionals including
doctors, journalists, lawyers,
police and armed forces.
Some chairs have also
developed curricula for
primary and secondary
schooling in their respective
countries.
Pierre Sané, the assistant
director general for social
and human sciences, told
participants that UNESCO
relied on them to relay the
organization’s human rights
strategy, which has been
developed around three
priority areas : economic,
social and cultural rights;
women’s rights and the fight
against racism and
discrimination.
Three new chairs are

Restoring Afghanistan’s
cultural heritage
Participants at a
UNESCO-organized
meeting in Kabul last
May decided not to
give priority to
reconstruction of  the
Bamiyan Buddhas,
which were
dynamited in March
2001.
Instead, the experts
and representatives
of several countries
and international
NGOs preferred to
concentrate on places
that had not yet been
damaged beyond
repair, and promised
seven million dollars
to help finance the
work. Sites chosen
include the Kabul
Museum, Babur’s
Moghul Gardens also
in Kabul, the Minaret
of Jam, and sites in
the cities of Herat
and Balkh. At
Bamiyan, some
600 caves and the
remains of murals
painted on the cliffs
will be protected and
restored and new
archaeological digs
started.
The main partners
involved in these
projects are the
governments of
France, Germany,
Greece, Italy and
Japan, along with
the Aga Khan
Foundation, the
Hirayama Foundation
and the Society for
the Protection of

SESAME opens door to
Middle East co-operation
UNESCO is backing a
science initiative that
could help promote
peaceful co-operation in
the Middle East, by
constructing an
international synchrotron
radiation centre in Jordan.
When completed, the
facility, baptised SESAME
(International Centre for
Synchrotron Light for
Experimental Science and
Applications in the Middle
East) will become the first
regional centre for co-
operation in basic research
in the Middle East.
The project was born in
1997, when Germany
decided to decommission
its $60 million BESSY 1
synchrotron and offered it
to the Middle Eastern
scientific community free
of charge. A 13-member
Interim Council is
overseeing the transfer,
installation and upgrading
of the facility in Jordan,
with another eleven
Member States as
observers.
When UNESCO’s
Executive Board approved
the initiative last May, the
Chairman of the
Programme and External
Relations Commission,
Professor Kenneth
Wiltshire, described it as a
“quintessential UNESCO
project,” combining
science and education in
the fields of international
cooperation for
development and peace.

(CMS), founded in 1959 in
Lucknow in the state of
Uttar Pradesh, is a school
unlike any other. With
25,000 pupils from
kindergarten up to high
school level, it figures in the
Guinness Book of Records
as the biggest private school
in the world, and its
students systematically score
higher on exams than the
national average. But it also
stands out because of it its
philosophy: for more than
40 years it has educated
students to respect the
values of tolerance and
peace and sought to make
them citizens of the world.
In recognition of this
remarkable achievement,

Timor’s cultural heritage
When East Timor became
independent last May 20 – the
world’s newest country –
UNESCO Director-General
Koïchiro Matsuura appealed to
governments to contribute to a
special fund to preserve its
cultural heritage.
Since the end of 1999, in
cooperation with the World
Bank, the UN Transitional
Administration in East Timor
(UNTAET) and the Portuguese
government, UNESCO has
provided technical aid to
restore Uma Fukum, the
oldest colonial building in
Dili, the capital.
After it has been restored,
Uma Fukum will become the
country’s national museum,
mainly housing items rescued
from the old one, which was
looted and badly damaged in
the war of independence.
Helped by Australia’s Darwin
Museum and Melbourne
University, UNESCO has
salvaged and repaired a
collection of 476 unique items,
including ancestral wooden
statues, china and fragments
of Neolithic pottery.  It is
hoped these will soon be
joined by Timorese artwork
currently held abroad.
Nine new sites, all cultural,
were added to UNESCO’s World
Heritage List last June,
including: the Minaret and
Archaeological Remains of Jam
(Afghanistan, see page 43), the
Upper Middle Rhine Valley
(Germany), the Historic centres
of Stralsund and
Wismar (Germany), the
Saint Catherine Area
(Egypt), the Tokaji Wine
Region Cultural
Landscape (Hungary),
the Mahabodhi Temple
Complex at Bodhgaya
(India), the Late Baroque
Towns of the Val di Noto
(Italy), the Ancient Maya
City of Calakmul
(Mexico), and the Historic
Inner City of Paramaribo
(Surinam,). The additions
bring the total number of
sites on the List to 730.
Meantime, the List of
World Heritage in Danger
has swelled to 33 sites,
with the inclusion of Jam,
(Afghanistan) which needs
consolidating and has been
regularly pillaged, and Tipasa
(Algeria), where unbridled
urban development is
encroaching on archaeological
remains which have also
suffered from vandalism.

Interactive atlas
of the oceans
Amid mounting concern
over continuing
deterioration of marine and
coastal ecosystems, several
of the world's foremost
ocean agencies have created
the first on-line, interactive
atlas of the world’s oceans.
The goal is to reverse the
decline and promote
sustainable development of
oceans. Over-fishing,
destruction of coastal
habitat and pollution from
industry, farms and
households are endangering
marine life and even the
global climate. The Atlas
spotlights these and other
acute marine issues. The UN
Food and Agricultural
Organization (FAO) has
been the lead agency
responsible for coordinating
this project. The atlas was
launched at the annual
meeting of UNESCO’s
Intergovernmental
Oceanographic Committee
in Paris, in May.
Consult the atlas at:
http://oceansatlas.org
Teaching science with zest
Science and
technology are all
around us, all the
time. Yet, young
people everywhere
are losing interest
in these fields,
which are too
often badly taught
or hardly taught at
all.
Most secondary
school teachers in
developing
countries never
receive proper
training in
scientific,
technological and
environmental
subjects. 
So it is hardly
surprising that
their students tend
to express little
interest in these
critical issues. 
To reverse this
trend, UNESCO has
developed a series
of six pedagogic
posters in
collaboration with
the Punjab State
Council for Science
and Technology
(Chandigarh,
India). The posters
use bold graphics
and succinct
English texts to
explain basic
scientific
principles, new
technologies and
methods of
investigation. They
are designed to
help teachers
teacher the
sciences better.
They also focus on
issues that young
people are
sensitive to, like
biodiversity,
pollution and the
importance of
recycling.
Literacy: slow progress
Almost 80 percent of the world’s
population aged 15 years and
over is now literate according to
new figures from UNESCO
released on International
Literacy Day (September 8).
The new estimates show
a steady fall in the number
of illiterate adults from
22.4 percent of the world’s
population (872m) in 1995 to
20.3 percent (862m) in 2000. 
The figures also show that
although women still make
up two thirds of the world’s
adult illiterates, they are
gaining access to education
and literacy at a faster rate
than men. This was most
evident in Africa, where, for
the first time, the majority of
women are now literate. 
However, progress remains
excruciatingly slow and meeting
the goal set by the World
Education Forum (Dakar, April
2000) to halve adult illiteracy by
2015 will clearly be an uphill
battle. Unless an extraordinary
effort is made, the percentage of
illiterate adults will fall by only
another five percentage points
by that date.
Mobilizing to safeguard
intangible heritage
On September 17,
representatives of
100 countries,
among them 72
culture ministers,
decided to develop
“policies which aim
at the identification,
safeguarding,
promotion and
transmission of the
intangible cultural
heritage,
particularly through
information and
education.” This
heritage consists of
languages, social
and religious
rituals, songs,
dances, plays and
unique crafts, all of
which are key
elements in cultural
diversity. 
In the Istanbul
Declaration,
adopted at the close
of a round-table
chaired by UNESCO
Director-General
Koïchiro Matsuura,
governmental
representatives
pledged to pay
special attention to
countries, such as
Afghanistan, and
territories suffering
from poverty,
conflicts or crises.
They called upon
UNESCO “to
examine the
possibility of
establishing a
special fund” to
safeguard intangible
heritage in danger
of disappearing. 
According to the
Istanbul
Declaration, “an
appropriate
international
convention […]
could be a positive
step” in pursuing
this goal. An
intergovernmental
expert meeting has
been scheduled to
prepare a
preliminary draft
convention.

Afghanistan
How it is
The United Nations estimates 
1.5 million Afghans have died, two
million have been wounded and five
million more made refugees in
fighting that started in 1979 with the
Soviet invasion. From 1992, when the
Soviets withdrew, until 1996, rival
war- lords fought a civil war. The
chaos this caused allowed the Taliban
to take over until they were driven out
last December by U.S.-led forces.

How it was
Afghanistan has a long history of
invasion and instability. Its location
astride the land routes between Iran,
China, Central Asia and the south
Asian subcontinent has always 
enticed conquerors. One of the first
was Alexander the Great in the third
century BC. His successors created
wealthy kingdoms in Afghanistan that
bridged the civilizations of East and
West. In the early centuries of our era
Afghanistan was the centre of the 
vast Kushan empire which acted as
intermediary in trade between India,
China and Rome. The Kabul Valley
was birthplace of Gandharan art,
beautifully blending Greek stone-
carving skills with Buddhist themes,
while in the 15th century Herat, in
northwestern Afghanistan, was 
capital of the Timurid Empire and a
verdant centre of art and learning.
How did it get so bad? 
In the early 1970s Afghanistan was beset by serious economic
problems, including  long-term drought. Maintaining that King
Muhammad Zahir Khan had mishandled the economic crisis and
was stifling political reform, a group of young military officers
overthrew the monarchy in July 1973 and proclaimed a republic.
Lt. Gen. Muhammad Daoud Khan became president and prime
minister, but in 1978 was himself deposed by a group led by
Noor Mohammed Taraki, who aligned Afghanistan with the
Soviet Union. In the late 1970s the government faced increasing
popular opposition to its social policies, and by 1979 guerrilla
opposition forces, popularly called mujahedeen, were active in
much of the country. In September, 1979, Taraki was killed and
Hafizullah Amin took power. Shortly thereafter, the Soviet Union
sent troops into Afghanistan, Amin was executed, and the Soviet-
supported Babrak Karmal became president.
The People
Although the continuous state of war in Afghanistan from
1979 onwards has caused substantial population
displacement, regional ethnicity is still generally the same.
Tajiks live around Herat in the northwest, Uzbeks live in the
north, the nomadic Turkmen live in the Vakhan in the
northeast. In the central mountains are the Hazaras, of
Mongolian origin. In the east and south are the Pashtuns,
the country’s largest ethnic group  in a total populaion of
about 22 million. Pashto and  Dari (Afghan Persian), plus
various Turkic tongues, mainly Uzbek and Turkmen, are the
country’s principle languages. Almost all the inhabitants are
Muslim; the large majority are Sunni, the minority,
numbering over two million, Shiite.

### 380093: Afghanistan: A nation at the crossroads

Over
two decades of
conflict and
three years of
drought have devastated Afghanistan’s
agriculture, says the UN Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO). As
farming and related activities are the only
means of livelihood for some 85 percent
of the population, the country is being
kept alive by international food aid.
Delivering relief supplies to remote
regions on a reliable basis, however, is
difficult, and millions of Afghans – most
of them children, says the UN Children’s
Emergency Fund (UNICEF) – remain at
risk.
HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES
The Afghan government too is living
hand-to-mouth. To meet its running costs,
the government has received grants of 
as much as $10 million each from India,
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates, which officials carried
back in suitcases because there is no
banking system in Kabul.
Hundreds of thousands of refugees 
have been returning to Afghanistan each
week, putting the country’s shattered
infrastructure under even greater 
strain and stretching still further the
government’s meagre resources.
Thousands of unemployed crowd
ministries and United Nations offices
looking for jobs. Beggars have staked out
houses where foreigners live, and Afghans
holding university degrees work as 
drivers for foreign aid agencies. 
Many of Afghanistan’s towns and cities
are badly damaged, with only intermittent
running water and electricity. Parts of
Kabul lie buried beneath thousands of
tons of rubble. While in the countryside
The Future
The Loya Jirga, or grand council of tribal elders, meeting in
Kabul in June, elected Hamid Karzai, the aristocratic Pashtun
tribal leader as president of the Transitional Administration that
will lead Afghanistan until elections in 2004. Outside of Kabul,
however, the government’s writ does not run strong. Warlords,
whose private armies control huge swathes of the country, pose
perhaps the gravest danger to the fragile transitional
government.
The Great Game
For almost a century Afghanistan was a pawn in the ‘Great Game’ played by
European imperial powers as they vied for influence in Central Asia. Napoleon’s
intrigues in Persia prompted the British in India to first open official relations
with Kabul in 1809. Russia’s steady expansion southwards across Central Asia
deepened their concern. Acutely aware of Afghanistan’s age-old position as a
highway from Persia and Central Asia to India, the British took an active interest
in the seating and unseating of princes on the throne of Kabul during the
remainder of the 19th century. Twice this interest led to war: first in 1838-42, and
again in 1878-80. Attempting to free Afghanistan from British influence, King
Amanullah invaded India in 1919. This third Afghan War was ended by the Treaty
of Rawalpindi, which gave Afghanistan full independence.

Throughout history Afghanistan served as a springboard for the
conquest of the south Asian subcontinent, and the Khyber
Pass, which links the two, was the gateway through which
these invaders - Persians, Kushans, Turks, Timurids and
Moghuls - poured. In recent times it was the main escape route
for millions of refugees fleeing the fighting in Afghanistan.
Now it is the main artery for aid to Kabul.

roam 700,000 armed men who must be
persuaded to give up their guns with aid,
jobs and education. 
Like much else in Afghanistan,
however, the education system too is in
shambles. Although more than 1.5 million
children turned up at the start of the new
school year, many more are still caught in
displacement camps and refugee centers.
Meanwhile, more teachers have to be
selected and trained; textbooks printed,
school supplies bought and distributed to
meet the expected influx of children if
peace prevails.
HUGE LOGISTICAL
CHALLENGES
These are huge logistical challenges in a
country with a poor road network,
shattered infrastructure and a heavy
infestation of land mines. Close
cooperation between national and local
authorities, UN agencies and the myriad
of non-governmental agencies (NGOs) 
is needed. “At present there is too much
competition,” says Cindar Isasac,
programme officer for Focus, the
humanitarian arm of the Aga Khan
Development Network.  
At last count, there were 18 UN
Agencies, 83 international NGO’s, and 111
Afghan NGO’s active in Kabul.
Competition among NGOs for funding and
projects is fierce,while NGOs, which have
been operating in Afghanistan for many
years, accuse recently returned UN
agencies, who pulled out during the
fighting, of poaching their trained staff.
“Mending Afghanistan,” says UN
Development Programme (UNDP)
Administrator Mark Malloch Brown, “is a
task for all of us, a historic wrong to be
put right and an opportunity for
North/South solidarity,” Brown, who was
named by UN Secretary General Kofi
Annan to head the recovery effort in
Afghanistan, says developing countries, as
well as the rich, can play an important
role in the country’s reconstruction.

Mending
Afghanistan is a
task for all of us
...an opportunity
for North/South
solidarity
UNDP Administrator,
Mark Malloch Brown 
UNESCO | the new Courier | October 2002
One of the few ancient monuments in
Afghanistan to survive the wrath of war, the
fury of the elements and acts of destruction
by the Taliban, is the Minaret of Jam. None
too soon, it has been placed on UNESCO’s
World Heritage List
The slender, tapering
minaret soars to a height
of 65 meters over the floor
of a remote valley in
western Afghanistan.
Modern scholars only
reached the site in 1957,
when discovery intact of
the enormous 12-century
brick tower caused a
sensation. It was a mystery
to architects how such a
structure stood for so long
in one of the world’s most
active earthquake zones.
And historians wondered
why it was the only
monument left standing by
Genghis Khan’s Mongol
hordes, who devastated
the region in 1221.
The Minaret of Jam is
the second tallest brick
tower in the world after the
Qutub Minar in New Delhi.
It is three-tiered and
decorated with a variety of
geometric and floral
patterned bands and
inscriptions in brick and
stucco. Located east of
Herat, the minaret stands
on the site of what may be
the capital of the Ghorid
Dynasty, which ruled
Afghanistan from 1148 to
1214. The site also includes
the ruins of a palace,
fortifications, and a
Jewish cemetery.
The Minaret of
Jam is one of over
60 towers, dating
from between the
early 11th and mid-
13th centuries, still
standing in Afghanistan,
Iran, and the Central Asian
Republics. The special
taste for towers in this
period, is ascribed to the
widespread recognition of
the form as an appropriate
symbol of the triumph of
Islam in the region. 
Some towers that
appear independent today
were once attached as
minarets to mosques built
of sun-dried brick that
have since disappeared.
Other towers, however,
were conceived as
independent, and also
served as landmarks to
guide caravans across the
landscape, or watchtowers
in times of war.
The most impressive 
of this latter type is
undoubtedly the Minaret
of Jam. Scholars speculate
that it was because of 
its usefulness as a
watchtower
that the Mongols spared it.
They also believe that
wooden beams inside the
brickwork may have
provided some of the
necessary tensile strength
for the tower to survive
earthquakes.
The minaret is now
threatened by water
seeping from the two
rivers at whose confluence
it stands, by vibrations
from a planned road-
building project nearby,
and continuing illegal
archaeological digs.
“It is vital that this
monument and the whole
archaeological site be
placed under constant
surveillance,” says
UNESCO consultant Prof.
Andrea Bruno of Italy,
who is also urging that
the proposed road route
be altered.

etracing this “trail” – which
centuries before was part of
the ancient Silk Road – we
sped out of Kabul one recent dawn on a
tour of Afghanistan’s five central
provinces within whose borders Asia’s
main overland trade routes once crossed.
Leaving the capital via the Koh Daman
Valley we passed hundreds of abandoned
villages, thousands of destroyed homes
and millions of withered vines. Crippled
tanks, burnt out trucks and twisted
artillery pieces littered the roadside, which
was lined by signs warning of landmines.
Koh Daman Valley was once one of the
richest and most beautiful valleys in the
country. It was noted mainly for its
vineyards, but almond, pear, apricot, fig
and cherry trees also flourished here. Not
any more. For this was the line of attack
on Kabul or – depending on which way
Afghanistan
Retracing the Silk
Driving through the
pulverized suburbs of
Kabul, across the
withered Afghan
plains and over the
war-debris-littered
passes of the Hindu
Kush, it is difficult to
imagine this
devastated land as it
once was: a centre of
great empires, an
international
crossroads of culture
and commerce, and,
in more recent years,
a safe and peaceful
stopover on the Asian
“hippy trail.”
AFGHAN JOURNEY
UNESCO projects in Afghanistan range
from new initiatives to rebuild the
country’s education systems and academic
life to restoring historical monuments and
museums damaged by war. Some
question whether historic sites should be
a priority for rebuilding when so much of
modern Afghanistan is in ruins, However,
UNESCO’s Pakistan representative
Ingeborg Breines points out that: “In post-
conflict countries it is extremely important
that people are rallied by something that
can give them a national identity.”
Much of the magnificent remains of
Afghanistan’s past have, however, already
vanished, victims of either shelling,
systematic theft or illegal excavations.
Kabul Museum was looted, and many
archaeological sites, such as Hadda, Aï-
Khanoum and Tillia Tepe, were dug up
and their treasures sold abroad. Finally,
the decree of Taliban spiritual leader
Mullah Omar on February 26 last year
ordering “all non-Islamic statues and
tombs” to be destroyed, led to the much-
publicised demolition of the Bamiyan
Buddhas.
One of Afghanistan’s few ancient
legacies still intact is the Minaret of Jam
(see previous page). In June, the minaret
was placed on UNESCO’s list of historical
monuments that should be preserved as
part of the world’s cultural heritage. It is
the first Afghan site to be inscribed on the
World Heritage List, earlier efforts by the
Afghan government to get sites listed
having been cut short by war.

the war was going – retreat to the fastness
of the Hindu Kush. Today most the Koh
Daman Valley vines are dead and its
orchards destroyed; their fruit trees
stripped for firewood.
Because of its strategic location at the
southern base of the Hindu Kush the
once-fertile Begram plain, which we now
crossed, was in recent years another
virtual war zone. It guards passes through
mountain ranges fanning out from the
towering Hindu Kush across the centre of
the country. In ancient times these passes
were gateways to India, Bactria,  and
Central Asia, and Alexander the Great
built a city here, which the Kushans later
made capital of their vast empire. They
called it Kapisa.
The Begram plain is desolate today, but
in 1939 archeologists excavating the ruins
of Kapisa discovered a treasure trove
UNESCO | the new Courier | October 2002
testifying to the existence here, nearly
2,000 years ago, of a highly refined and
cultured citizenry. In two small rooms in
the royal city were exquisite Indian ivories
and Chinese lacquers side by side with an
infinite variety of objects from the far-
flung reaches of the Roman Empire.
SIGNS OF CHANGE
Overlooking Kapisa is a low hill
celebrated in Muslim legend. It is said
that the Imam Hannifa Ghazni has lived
inside this hill, known as Reg Rawan or
Moving Sands, for the past one thousand
years and that one day he will emerge to
bring peace to the region. His failure to
appear during the recent years of of
conflict, said our guide, has somewhat
shaken his reputation.
Three important caravan routes from
China, India and Central Asia met at
Kapisa.  We took the one along the
Ghorband Valley, which once led to
Central Asia. In recent years, the valley
was a front line between the forces of the
Taliban and their oponents of the
Northern Alliance, and signs of fierce
fighting were frequent: burnt out
armoured cars, broken bridges, and more
abandoned homes.
There were signs too, however, that life
in the valley was slowly returning to
normal. It was early morning as we
climbed the stepped-sided valley, and
hundreds of children were hurrying to
school. Among them were groups of
laughing girls, many of them attending
classes for the first time in six years. “Its
the first time I’ve seen smiles on their
faces in years,” said Sean McQade, an
engineer with more than ten years work
experience in the region.
Crossing the Shibar Pass, we stopped at
Eljanak village where 60-year-old Hussain
Ali was rebuilding his house with the help
of his neighbours. The wooden beams
supporting the house had been removed
after Hussain and his family fled, causing
the roof to collapse and most of the mud
walls to cave in. A neighbouring house

### 380093: Afghanistan: A nation at the crossroads

The Silk Roads:
Roads of Dialogue
Long before the beginning
of East-West trade the
geographical traces that
later formed the Silk Road
were ancient pathways of
profit. An early urban
bronze-age civilization that
arose in northern
Afghanistan developed an
active caravan trade
linking the civilizations of
the Indus Valley and
Mesopotamia. The finest
lapis lazuli in the world
was brought west from the
Afghan highlands of
Badakhshan to Sumer and
Egypt 5,000 years ago by
this route. Later, ancient
Bactria, in northern
Afghanistan, was joined to
India by a 4,200-kilometer
road built by Indian’s
Maurya dynasty, and was
linked to Central Asia and
the Middle East by the
imperial highways of the
Persians.
The formal opening of
the Silk Road to China is
usually placed in the late
second century BC, when
Emperor Wu of the Han
Dynasty, expanded his
empire into Central Asia,
where his imperial routes
and agents connected with
the existing routes to
India, the Middle East and
Rome. The Kushans, a
dynasty of nomadic kings,
who, from their center in
Afghanistan, controlled a
vast empire reaching from
China to the Caspian Sea,
acted as intermediaries
between the Roman West
and the Chinese East,
issuing gold coins on the
model of Roman denarii
to facilitate trade. 
The extent of
international trade at this
period is best exemplified
by the discovery of the so-
called Begram Treasure,
found at Begram, the site
of one of the ancient
capitals of the Kushan
Empire, north of Kabul. It
contained Indian ivories,
Chinese lacquer-ware, and
a bronze statuette of a
deity from an eastern
province of the Roman
empire.
In the following
centuries, the names of
the leading actors changed
but the basic roles
remained the same. A final
dramatic chapter in the
history of the Silk Road
was written in the 14th
century by the Turco-
Mongol Timurids. Timur,
the dynasty’s founder,
known in the West as
Tamerlane, was one of the
most successful warriors
the world has ever known.
In a series of military
campaigns, he conquered
all of Eurasia from the
Great Wall of China to the
Urals. Trade revived, and
Herat, the capital of the
empire in the 15th and
16th centuries, became a
centre for painters and
craftsmen from all over
the Middle and Near East. 
Timur’s successors,
however, lacked the
authority of their ancestor,
and were unable to hold
together the vast steppe
empire he had created.
Tribes revolted and
political instability set in –
followed by economic
depression and cultural
decline. Weak and
disorganized, Central Asia
was no longer capable of
playing the role of
intermediary vital to
continued East-West trade. 
Meanwhile, in
1426, in an effort
to expunge long
years of foreign
influence and
resuscitate
traditional
Chinese values,
the Ming
Dynasty closed
China’s borders.
After 1,500 years
as a main artery
between East and West,
the Silk Road was finally
cut, preserving during the
following centuries only
the romance of its name
and the vague memory
that somehow, long ago, it
had been important.

Many refugees
have lost all,
others are 
too frightened 
to return
From Eljanak village we drove down
the steep Shibar valley to Bamiyan. The
town is dominated from the north by high
sandstone cliffs in which are cut two
enormous niches. Now eerily empty they
once contained two of the world’s tallest
standing Buddhas (see page 48) –
demolished in 2001 by the Taliban. Today,
all that remains are forlorn piles of rubble
at the bottom of each niche covered by
UNESCO with protective fibreglass. 
Caves in the cliff face that once served
as cells for Buddhist monks are now
home for families from nearby villages
destroyed by Taliban forces. And at the
base of the cliff what was once a thriving
bazaar lies devastated by civil war. 
was blackened by fire but was relatively
intact. In fact, although most damage we
saw in urban areas was caused by
fighting, in rural areas it seemed to result
from the removal of wooden beams: the
only thing of value left in the house after
families fled.
Millions of refugees, who fled to
neighbouring Pakistan and Iran, and to a
lesser extent Tajikistan and Turkmenistan,
are now being urged to return home.
Many, however, have no homes to return
too, while others are deterred by
uncertainties.
“They want to be sure that when they
return they have food, water, and security.
Even though the refugee camps are
primitive they do have these here,” said
Shahnaz Akhtar of OCKENDEN
International, an NGO involved in
repatriation. Others, she said, are
reluctant to return because they are afraid
they won’t be able to get out again if
things turn sour.
UNESCO | the new Courier | October 2002
Bamiyan was once mainly populated by
Tajik, but they fled when Taliban forces,
who were mainly Pashtuns, occupied the
town. Later, Hazaras from surrounding
villages moved in. “There was a lot of
movement of refugees internally as well
as externally,” explained agriculturalist
Karim Dostyar, at whose aid outpost we
spent the night sleeping round a warming
stove. “And this is now causing tensions.”
FOOD FOR ALL!
Later we saw first hand what these
tensions were. Stopping off at Samangan,
so our translator could visit the home his
family fled to escape the fighting, we
found it occupied by complete strangers.
It was a tense meeting, and Afghan
officials acknowledge that reclaiming lost
assets could take years.
Driving through rivers where bridges
had been blown up to halt the enemy’s
advance, we reached Wadou. Here we
faced an impromptu assembly of angry
village elders, who crowded into the
house of a former commander who
invited us for tea. As we sat cross-legged
on cushions and sipped the sweet green
liquid they complained that although
neigbouring villages had received food aid
their village had not. 
At the next village – where sacks of
World Food Programme wheat were being
distributed from the back of a truck – we
discovered why. Wadou it seems had
accidentally fallen between two
distribution zones. Such administrative
mixups create tensions between villages,
which, although neighbouring frequently
belong to different ethnic, tribal of
religious groups.
At least most of the food aid now
seems to be getting through to the people
who deserve it. In the past, some 50
percent of it went to the warlords. Now, a
senior Afghan aid worker in Pol-i-Kumbri
told me, they get only ten percent.

### 380093: Afghanistan: A nation at the crossroads

Afghanistan
The Valley of Bamiyan lies
at the heart of the Hindu
Kush Mountains about 150
miles northwest of Kabul.
During the early centuries
of our era endless
caravans of luxury-laden
camels plodded along the
Silk Road, passing through
the valley. Later, Buddhist
monks joined these
caravans and a great
religious center burgeoned
in Bamiyan. 
About 400 AD the
pilgrim Fa Hsien came to
Bamiyan from China, and
described a sumptuous
assembly attended by
such large numbers of
monks that they came, it
seemed, «as if in clouds.» 
The great wonders at
Bamiyan were two
monumental Buddhas
carved into the face of the
sandstone cliff dominating
the town from the north.
The eldest of these two
statues, was 38 meters tall.
The other measured 55
meters.
Around and between
them a maze of cells and
sanctuaries were
painstakingly cut out, their
ceilings and walls
smoothed over with mud-
and-straw plaster and then
painted with inspirational
scenes. The Buddhas were
probably executed during
the 3rd to 4th centuries;
the murals mainly during
the 7th.
The encounter between
Buddhism and Islam did
not result in the immediate
decline of the monastries
of Bamiyan. Although the
local ruler embraced Islam
during the late 8th century,
Buddhism and Islam
existed side by side for at
least another hundred
years. By the 9th century,
however, Buddhism had
faded from the valley, to
be replaced by Islam.
The Buddhas continued
to survive invasions, for
another thousand years.
They could not, however,
survive the Taliban, which
last March, reduced them
to a pile of rubble.
UNESCO Director-
General Koïchiro Matsuura
said it was abominable to
witness the cold and
calculated destruction of
cultural properties that
were the heritage, not only
of the Afghan people, but
the whole world. “The
Buddhas of Bamiyan were
not inscribed on the World
Heritage List but deserved
to be and their destruction
represents a true cultural
crime. The loss is
irrevesible.”
The question of whether
to reconstruct the
destroyed giant Buddhas
of Bamiyan is very
controversial.
However, all involved are
agreed that the cliffs of
Bamiyan and the 600
caves and remains of the
mural paintings with
which they are decorated,
should be protected and
restored.
UNESCO proposes to
shore up the cliffs at
Bamiyan, conserve in situ
the remains of the statues,
and make archeological
test probes to find new
caves. A small museum
will also be created and
new excavations
undertaken to try and
locate a giant reclining
Buddha several hundred
meters long said to be
buried somewhere in the
Bamiyan Valley. The
$700,000 project will be
financed by Japan through
their Funds-in-Trust at
UNESCO.

northern Afghan plains with the valleys of
Koh Daman and Kabul. 
Opened in November 1964, the 2.7 km
tunnel took six years to build. An
additional 5.4 km of galleries have been
constructed to keep the approaches free of
snow. Today the tunnel is in a dangerous
state of disrepair. Snow has gathered and
frozen in the damaged galleries reducing
traffic to one-way on alternate days – at
least in theory. On the day we drove
through it was coming from both
directions, causing total chaos.
Stalled at the mouth of the tunnel, aid
workers posed for photos on top of an
abandoned bulldozer, once used to clear
away the snow. We gave one of them a
ride, through the tunnel, down by the
Salang River and back to Kabul along
more roads littered with the endless
debris of war. As we approached the
capital, I asked our passenger, Deborah
Storie, a six-year veteran of the
International Assistance Mission (IAM) to
Afghanistan, for her impression of recent
developments.
“There is a veneer of change, but it
does not go very deep,” she said; which
seemed to sum up much of what I had
been told on our journey through this
devastated land.
Pul-i-Khumri, its cement and
textiles factories now largely
silent because of lack of spare
parts to mend broken plant,
and not enough raw cotton
to feed them. The factories
now employ only a fraction
of their former thousand-
strong workforce, and recent
returnees told us it was
pointless even going to ask for their old
jobs back; yet another source of tension
between those Afghans who stayed
and those who fled and are now
returning.
That night I had dinner with a group 
of young aid workers in their compound.
The foreigners talked mainly of the fun
they would have when their stint in Pul-i-
Khumri was over. The Afghans talked
only of staying and of the prospects of
permanent peace. “This time there will be
peace,” said one young Afghan. “People
are tired of the fighting”. 
Older Afghans I talked to, however,
were not so sure. “Things haven’t
changed,” a middle-aged engineer told me
next day. “The mullahs (Muslim clerics)
and the commanders (warlords) are still
in control. Every family still has a
weapon, and 40 percent of Afghans earn
their living from their guns.”
Some things, however, are changing.
Evidenced, for example, at a school we
visited at Pul-i-Khumri. Here hundreds of
eager boys and girls were squatting in the
playground, while their classrooms were
being refurbished. As we were leaving
lorries laden with new desks and chairs
rolled in through the gates. 
Returning to Kabul via the Salang Pass,
the road climbed by the side of the
Khinjan River through numerous
mullberry groves, then rose steeply across
rugged slopes sprinkled with Asian
conifers. At an altitude of 3,363 metres is

of wonder for tourists until the destruction of

races of intense cultural activity
once marked the routes that
centuries ago joined east and
west, north and south across Afghanistan.
Ruins of ancient cities, such as Kapisa, in
the heart of Afghanistan, and Aï
Khanoum and Yemshi on the northern
Afghan plains told a story of complex
exchanges with other lands. 
At Aï Khanoum, archeologists
discovered an orientalized Greek city; at
Kapisa they unearthed a treasure trove of
Indian ivories, Chinese lacquers and
Roman art, and at Yemshi they found
motives reflecting the disparate artistic
styles of India, Greece, Iran, China and
the nomads of Central Asia.
War, theft and acts of destruction by
the Taliban have, however, devastated
much of Afghanistan’s rich and varied
heritage, which vividly illustrated several
high points in the history of civilization
over the past 2,500 years. And although
efforts are now underway to protect what
remains, much of what was destroyed is
irreplacable.
THE LEGACY OF
ALEXANDER THE GREAT 
The Achaemenid Persians were the first to
include Afghanistan in their empire in the
6th century BC, but a few coins found at
the foot of Tepe Maranjan in the centre of
Kabul were the only surviving evidence of
their presence. These have now been
stolen.
Afghanistan’s strategic position at the junction of China, India, Central
Asia and the Middle East, made it a meeting point of culture, commerce,
conversion and conquest. Its art, architecture and archaeology bear
witness to this extraordinary past.

### 380093: Afghanistan: A nation at the crossroads

Once one of the cultural
icons of Kabul, the
museum was repeatedly hit
by rockets during the 1991-
96 civil war, and two-thirds
of its unique collection
systematically looted. Many
irreplacable items, such as
the Begram ivories (right),
the entire numismatic
collection, and fragments of
Buddhist wall paintings
from the Bamiyan Valley
disappeared. Later, the
Taliban smashed many of
its Greco-Buddhist statues.
Of two nearly 2,000-year-
old statues – one believed
to represent the Kushan
King Kanishka I, the other a
Kushan nobleman - that
once graced the entrance
hall, nothing is left but the
feet. The fragments of
these and other smashed
statues are piled in crates
in the museum, in the hope
that experts, using digital
and virtual assembly
techniques, can
reconstitute some of them.
It is also hoped to bring
back items taken abroad
illegally as soon as the
museum is secure.
With the help of Greece,
the museum building,
which is situated in the
war-ravaged suburb of
Darulaman, some eight
kilometres from the centre
of Kabul, is to regain its
roof and windows. Efforts
to restore the museum’s
collection have already
begun, with CEREDAF, a
French NGO, furnishing the
required materials, and the
Musee Guimet of France,
the British Museum and the
SPACH (Society for the
Protection of Afghanistan’s
Cultural Heritage, an NGO)
contributing to the
inventory and training of
personnel.
“We must hurry, for 15
years the artifacts have not
been treated and many
have defects” said the
museum director as he
showed a recent visitor
around the dark, dusty
museum, which six months
after the fall of the Taliban
was still without water or
electricity. 
The first museum in
Afghanistan was
established in 1919 in the
Bagh-i-Bala palace
overlooking Kabul, and
consisted of manuscripts,
miniatures, weapons and
art objects belonging to
former royal families. A few
years later the collection
was moved to the king’s
palace in the city centre 
and in 1931 was officially
installed in the present
building, which King
Amanullah had originally
intended to be the
Municipality of a new
capital area on the outskirts
of Kabul.
The original collection
was dramatically enriched,
beginning in 1922, by the
first excavations of the
Delegation Archeologique
Francais et Afghanistan
(DAFA). Through
the years other
archeological
expeditions
added their finds
to the museum
until the
collection
spanned  6,000
years, including
the Prehistoric,
Classical, Buddhist, Hindu
and Islamic periods. 
Kabul Museum: Keeping
Afghanistan’s culture alive
A banner hung over the entrance of Kabul museum earlier this year proudly 
proclaimed: “A nation stays alive when its culture stays alive.” Inside, however, 
tells a different story.

### 380093: Afghanistan: A nation at the crossroads

Afghanistan
Uzbekistan and Tadjikistan, eventually
taking in the whole of northern India and
parts of northwest China. 
Having no traditions on which to build
a settled way of life, the nomadic Kushans
adapted what they found in ways best
suited to their own personality. What
emerged was a vibrant indigenous culture
born of the fusion of western oriented
Greco-Bactrian styles with those from
eastern-oriented India and interpreted by
the forceful character of Central Asia. 
The result was vital and dynamic and is
best illustrated by the Golden Hord of
Bactria: a treasure trove of Kushan art
discovered at Tillya Tepe in the vicinity of
the city of Shibarghan on the northern
Afghan plain. Archeological excavations,
began there in 1978, revealed six tombs
dating from the lst century AD, the zenith
of Kushan power in these regions. The
excavators speculate that the burials, five
of them women, were of the nobility of
the nearby ancient city of Yemshi,
perhaps even the rulers.
The corpses were draped in cloth
shrouds decorated with hundreds of gold
and silver disks reflecting the many
traditional art styles of Central Asia.
Indian, Greek, Iranian, and Chinese motifs
are readily perceptible, but perhaps most
interesting is the influence of the animal
art of the pastoral nomads. The infusion
Alexander the Great, having crushed
Achaemenid power, was the next to
invade Afghanistan in 328 BC. A
Macedonian who became steeped in
Greek culture after his conquest of Greece,
and then an oriental monarch captivated
by the idealism of the East, Alexander
was himself the embodiment of cultural
intermingling.
Unable to quite conquer Central Asia,
because of fierce resistance, Alexander
colonized it. He founded several new
cities there and his men intermarried,
introducing Hellenism but at the same
time becoming thoroughly Asianized and
integrated into the local population. This
cross-fertilization of cultures resulted in a
multinational kingdom that bridged the
disparate cultures of India, Iran, Greece
and China. It’s name was Bactria and one
of its cities was at Aï Khanoum, at the
confluence of the Kokcha and Amu Darya
(ancient Oxus) rivers in northern
Afghanistan.
Aï Khanoum was the easternmost
Greek city ever discovered in Asia, and
before their work there was interrupted by
the Soviet invasion in 1979, French
archeologists uncovered a triangular
metropolis with sides 1.6 km long. Inside
it were many typical Greek monuments,
including a gymnasium, a 6,000-seat
theatre, a stadium, public baths and
temples. Its Hellenistic architecture
incorporated the three classical styles:

Ionic, Doric and Corinthian. Some of its
shrines, however, were more Persian than
Greek.
The past five years have been fatal for
Aï Khanoum. “The site has been ravaged
by clandestine diggings,” says Afghan
archeologist Zemaryalai Tarzi.  “And what
was left of the ancient ruins, including
stately columns, their shafts, capitals and
bases, have been transported for use as
ordinary building materials in
neighbouring villages.” 
Alexander`s conquests took place at a
time when Greek art and thought were in
fullest flower and the peoples of Asia
were quick to adopt – and adapt – the
aesthetics of Greece. A single example
speaks volumes: statues at Tepe Shotor
near Jalalabad, in southern Afghanistan,
represent Alexander, Heracles and
Dionysos as acolytes of Buddha. Tepe
Shotor, which, transformed into an open-
air museum, was one of the brightest
jewels of Afghan archeology, has also
been destroyed.
THE NOMAD INVASIONS 
No fully satisfactory explanation has ever
been offered for the periodic explosion of
nomadic peoples from – or through –
Central Asia, but the pattern is clear: the
region’s sedentary peoples were
repeatedly overrun by mounted nomads,
and its cities repeatedly razed and rebuilt
with each successive invasion.  The
invaders pitched their tents and settled
down, adopting the civilized ways of
those they had conquered. And, having
become soft themselves, they submitted
in turn to a new wave of hardy warriors.
Thus, in the first century BC, the Greek
kingdom of Bactria was conquered by the
Scythians, who, one hundred years later,
were overrun by the Parthians. Hard on
their heels rode the Kushans, nomads of
Central Asian origins, who at the
beginning of our era settled astride the
Hindu Kush. From their centre in
Afghanistan the Kushans, pushed their
frontiers across what is now Pakistan,

### 380093: Afghanistan: A nation at the crossroads

Fine Arts and Crafts
Afghanistan’s figurative artists and sculptors are getting back to
work. At the Academy of Fine Arts in Kabul a wooden figure of a
woman, unthinkable under the Taliban, was being carved this
summer. While exhibits at the newly-opened Gallery of Fine Arts 
and Traditional Afghan Crafts included figurative works of over 
20 known Afghan artists, plus many new ones. 
Under the Taliban’s strict
interpretation ofF Islam all
figurative art and sculpture was
banned. Even today some
conservatives still oppose it.
“The long war, and especially
the last five years, was
especially difficult for Afghan
artists,” says the Coordination of
Humanitarian Assistance (CHA),
which after three years in exile
in Pakistan recently opened a
gallery in Kabul.
Although fine ceramic art no
longer flourishes in Herat,
UNESCO-supported craftsmen
still produce glazed brick and
slab for restoration of the city’s
ancient Muslim monuments.
The preparation of glazed
brick is simple: the baked brick is
dipped into, or painted with,
coloured glazes mixed from
seven ingredients, including
pigments. It is then fired for one
day or more – depending on the
colour – at 1000 degrees
centigrade, in a process which
has remained virtually
unchanged for centuries
The Mesopotamians were the
first people to use glazed brick
as a contruction material. They
used it to make mud walls water
resistant rather than as
decoration. But glaze allowed
the introduction of colour, and
these colourful surfaces,
decorated with beautiful
geometric and floral forms,
arabesque panels and elegant
bands of calligraphy, eventually
became an indispensable
element of Islamic architecture,
absorbing the creative genius
that, in the Christian West, went
into frescoes and sculpture.
of this pastoral style gave life to an art
that was fast becoming static, as the
hybrid traditions from which it derived
lost their vigor.
Another eloquent example of the
encounter of civilizations on Afghan soil
is the Treasure of Begram discovered in
the ruins of the Kushan summer capital of
Kapisa, 60 kilometers northeast of Kabul,
on the fertile Begram plain. French
archeologists excavating the site shortly
before the outbreak of World War II found
a treasure trove of precious objects from
the eastern Mediterranean, India and
China. Hidden in a chamber of the royal
city, they found hundreds of plaster
moulds of Greco-Roman medallions,
painted glassware from Alexandria in
Egypt and Chinese lacquered furniture
encrusted with Indian ivory. The ivories
were divided between the French Musee
Guimet and the Kabul museum. Those in
Kabul have long since disappeared.
BUDDHISM AND
GANDHARAN ART
It’s difficult to say how early Buddhism
entered Afghanistan. According to legend
it arrived from its homeland in India via
Trapusa and Bhallika, two merchants who
were the first lay followers of Buddha.

east decisively altering the strength and
distribution of its religions. 
Afghanistan was affected by both of
these developments. Visiting Kabul in
644, Chinese pilgrim Hsuen-tsang noted:
“The king is Turk, the men naturally
fierce and impetuous.”
THE GROWTH OF 
THE ISLAMIC EMPIRE
Not only did the Turks of Central Asia
embrace Islam, they became its new cut-
ting edge. By the end of the first millen-
nium, the military manpower and fighting
skills of Turkic steppe nomads had taken
over the role played by the desert
Bedouins during Islam’s first extraordinary
period of expansion through the Near
East. And a second era of Muslim expan-
sion began. 
From the final decades of the 10th
century through the 11th and 12th
centuries Afghanistan was the seat of
powerful Muslim kingdoms: first the
Ghaznavid Dynasty, then the Ghorid
dynasty. During this period Islam became
firmly established in Afghanistan, which
became a springboard for the islamization
of northern India.
identifying the name Bhallika with the
town of Bahlika (Balkh) in northern
Afghanistan. It is more probable, however,
that it was at the time of the 2nd century
AD Kushan king Kanishka I that
Buddhism spread from northwest India
through Afghanistan to areas further
north and east. 
At the same time, Buddhist art also
crossed the borders of its land of origin
penetrating the cultures it encountered. A
curious hybrid art form emerged
combining Western Classical elements
with those of Central and southern Asia.
It carried the name of the region where its
famous workshops flourished: Gandhara,
an area comprising the Kabul Valley and
adjacent areas.
Gandhara subjects reflect not an
intermingling or proper synthesis but the
often awkward coexistence of disparate
stylistic influences that have – for that
reason – made Gandharan sculpture so
distinctive. These influences are Greco-
Roman, Indian and Parthian. 
It was also at Gandhara that the
Hellenistic concept of personality
combined with religious influences from
India, to bring about one of the turning
points of Buddhist art. Up to this point the
Buddha himself had not been represented
in person. Instead, symbols such as an
empty throne, a horse without a rider, a
parasol, a bodhi tree or footprints had
been used to indicate his presence. But at
Gandhara the image of the Buddha
appears in human form for the first time.
This notably gave rise to giant statues
of Buddha at Bamiyan (See page 48), in
the heart of the Hindu Kush, which were
demolished in 2001 following a decree by
the Taliban’s spiritual leader Mullah Omar
ordering “all non-Islamic statues and
tombs” to be destroyed.
In the 6th century, Turkic tribes began a
westward wave of migrations from their
original homeland in Mongolia that
ethnically swamped Central Asia. While
in the 8th century, Muslim Arabs swept
The Ghaznavids, in 1008, defeated a
confederacy of Hindu rulers at Peshawar,
annexed the Punjab, and extended
Muslim influence as far south as Lahore.
Then came the Ghorid conquests which,
by the end of the 11th century, had
expanded Muslim rule over most of
northern India, adding Delhi and Ajmer to
the Islamic realm in 1192, and two years
later Bihar and Bengal. 
The spread of Islam brought profound
changes in the art and culture of Central
Asia. In the 9th to 13th centuries,
figurative fresco and sculpture – forbidden
by Islam – disappeared, and was replaced
by non-representational art. Four main
styles of decoration: floral, calligraphic,
geometric and arabesque dominated all
other art forms.
Despite the dominance of common
Islamic values each region preserved
essential individual features of its art and
culture. Among these were the miniature
paintings of the School of Behzad in
Herat, which continued to represent
human images.
In the field of architecture, Muslims
allied the traditions of the past with
scientific and mathematical precision and

Babur’s tomb is a modest
structure in comparison to
the elaborate edifices built
by his descendents in
India. It was once
surrounded by the
beautifully landscaped
gardens know as Bagh-e-
Babur. But decades of
neglect, 23 years of war
and four years of drought
have seen the gardens
perish and left their
historical buildings
decayed. At walking
distance from the city
centre, they are now
surrounded by urban
sprawl climbing up the
hillside into which they
are set.
Babur, who claimed
direct descent from both
Genghis Khan and Timur,
seized the throne of Kabul
after being ousted from
his own in the Ferghana
Valley. From Kabul, in
1525, he launched his
invasion of India and
became the first of the
Moghul emperors with his
court at Agra.
Babur, however, never
forgot Kabul, and when he
died, in 1539, he was
buried there, according to
his wishes, in Bagh-e-
Babur. A century later
Shah Jahan, who built the
Taj Mahal, constructed a
small marble mosque in
Babur’s Garden, close to
the simple tomb of his
forefather. In the late 19th
century Amir Abdur
Rahman built a elegant
pillared pavilion whose
veranda looked out over
terraced gardens dotted
with fountains,
magnificent stands of
chinar (plane) trees, and a
profusion of sweet
smelling wild rose and
jasmine to the city beyond. 
According to
researchers, the Bagh-e-
Babur gardens were laid
out  between 1504 and
1528. They were damaged
by an earthquake in 1842
which ruined many parts
of Kabul. The gardens
were restored by the
Afghan ruler Amir Abdur
Rahman in the late 18th
century and again by King
Nadir Shah in the 1930s.
But both men were
influenced by European
gardens and the Islamic
tradition of the garden was
ignored. Later the gardens
became a public
playground with the
construction, during
Communist rule, of a
swimming pool.
A multi-year renovation
project will restore the
shrine and mosque
according to their original
design, and if feasible the
pavilion, which was
severely damaged, then
partially restored.
Neighbourhood residential
dwellings will be
rehabilitated, and the
gardens replanted with
trees, flowers and other
ornamentation appropriate
to Moghul tradition.
Walkways and benches
will be constructed for
public use so that
residents of Kabul may
enjoy the gardens again.

Afghanistan
it reflected the influence of all three. Nor
was it modeled on the old Central Asia.
Instead, these captured architects
embellished Timurid cities with buildings
possessing a new and dazzling Tatar
concept.
The 40-year rule of Timur’s son, Shah
Rukh, a devout Muslim and a man of
peace, saw the transformation of the
restless nomad empire into an orthodox
Sunni Muslim state with Herat, in
western Afghanistan, as its capital.
Although Herat is also known for its
monuments dating from the powerful
Muslim Ghorid dynasty – including the
12th century Great Mosque, which was
reconstructed in the 14th century in all
its blue and turquoise-tiled splendor –
the city’s real treasures are its
monuments from the 15th and 16th
centuries, when the art of Timurid
ceramic revetment reached its height.
Even after the collapse of the Timurid
Empire, the faience mosaic and blue tiles
that were its hallmark continued to exert
strong influence on later flowerings of
ceramic art in Iran and Turkey.
The court of Shah Rukh and his
successor Husayn were verdant centers of
art and learning. The enlightened
sovereigns protected such creative
personalities as the poet Djami and the
miniature painter Behzad. During their
rule Herat became one of Asia’s most
important literary, artistic and cultural
centres.
One of Herat’s favorite sons was Mir Ali
Shir Nava’i, a venerated 15th century
poet, known as “the Chaucer of the
Turks.” As Chaucer had done in English,
Nava’i revolutionized a national literature
by becoming the first  outstanding writer
to use the Turkish vernacular in his
works. In Nava’i’s hands, Turkish, a
language traditionally regarded by
medieval men of letters as uncouth and
plebeian, achieved recognition as a
graceful medium for poetry and prose of
the highest order.
developed new forms in building and new
tastes in decoration. This produced a large
number of masterpieces of architecture
and art, including the early 12th century
Tower of Masud III, at Ghazni in central
Afghanistan, whose plan is an eight-
pointed star with seven bands of
ornamental brickwork, terra-cotta panels
and stucco decorating its shaft; and the
late 12th century Minaret of Jam which
soars to a height of 65 meters over the
western Afghan plains (See page 43). 
THE TIMURID
RENAISSANCE
This fruitful cultural development was
interrupted by the devastating invasion of
Central Asia by the armies of Genghiz
Khan. Only in the 14th and 15th centuries
with the emergence of the Timurid
Dynasty did Central Asia have the
opportunity for a renaissance of culture. 
In a succession of 15 military
campaigns in 23 countries lasting
50 years, Timur, known in the West as
Tamerlane, carved out an empire
stretching from the Indus River to the
Black Sea. By 1370 the Turco-Mongol
warrior was undisputed leader of the
steppe, and in 1380 defeated the Il Khans
to become master of Persia. In 1398,
Timur stormed through the Khyber Pass,
devastated Sind and Punjab and sacked
Delhi. In 1399 he invaded Georgia, and
in 1401 stormed Baghdad and Damascus.
In 1402 he defeated the Turkish Ottomans
in Ankara. Had he not died of pneumonia
in 1405, as he was leading his armies
against China, Timur may even have
conquered that too.
Timurid art forged a new aesthetic by
linking the cultural traditions of the many
lands they conquered with their own
Turkic origins. From conquered territories
in Persia, India and the Middle East,
Timur plundered both talented craftsmen
and treasures to enhance the cities of
Central Asia. What they created was
neither Persian, Indian or Arab, although

Born in Herat in 1441, Nava’i added the
Turkish language to the roster of the
world’s major literatures. One of his best-
known verses is:
Since the best of men must pass 
through Death’s portal,
Happy is he who makes his name
immortal.
One man who did, was Timur’s great-
great-great-grandson Babur, who seized
Kabul and carved out a kingdom in
Afghanistan, from where he launched his
invasion of India to become the first of
the Moghul emperors.
At Kabul, Babur built a beautiful
landscape garden (See page 55 ) that was
the predecessor of many famous imperial
gardens in the South Asian sub-
continent. Babur’s garden was damaged
by internal fighting between 1992 and
1995, as were many other cultural icons
of Kabul, including the museum (See
page 51). 
With the help of UNESCO and other
organizations active in the restoration
process, including the Aga Khan Trust for
Culture and the Development and
Humanitarian Services of Afghanistan,
this and historical sites elsewhere in
Afghanistan are to be restored. 
Meeting in Kabul in May, Afghan
authorities and international organizations
seeking to rehabilitate Afghanistan’s
cultural heritage, mandated UNESCO to
establish an international committee to
undertake operations concerning the
safeguarding of the Afghan cultural
heritage. A similar type of structure has
already been successful in Cambodia,
where it has been working since the end
of that country’s war.

EDUCATION
In
Afghanistan’s native languages,
they call the start of the new 
school year “Sabak,” meaning
the “return to learning.” This year
“Sabak” took on special significance. For
many of the l.5 million boys and girls
who reported for school were entering a
classroom for the very first time, following
years of school closures and exclusion of
girls from formal education. 
In what it described as its largest-ever
logistical exercise in support of education,
the UN Children’s Emergency Fund
(UNICEF) delivered more than 7,000
tonnes of learning materials to virtually
every elementary school in the country.
The supplies included textbooks,
blackboards, pencils and notebooks.
Teaching aids, tents for use as makeshift
classrooms, and other teaching and
learning materials. 
It was just one component of an
Afghan back-to-school campaign led by
the new administration that mobilized
teachers, registered children, readied
elementary school facilities, and
reorganized a curriculum from scratch.
UNESCO for its part focused its efforts
on assisting in the creation of an efficient
education ministry, the improvement of
teacher training, and the development of
curricula and textbooks not only for
primary schools, but also for secondary,
technical and higher education.
Earlier this year, UNESCO funded
nationwide university entrance
examinations, covering the expenses of
professors to travel to provincial cities to
supervise the exams as well as the cost of
printing examination papers and answer
sheets. The examinations were a huge
success with 20,000 candidates
participating, of whom 16,400 – many of
them women – were admitted. 
JUMP-STARTING
HIGHER EDUCATION
Another UNESCO-funded initiative
enabled the Ministry of Education to
bring together more than 91 Afghan
educators from some 26 different
provinces to talk about educational
issues. This workshop was the first
occasion in more than 20 years that the
directors of education offices  throughout
Afghanistan met to share views on how
they foresaw the education system in
the future.
Return to learning
The thirst for education and knowledge in post-Taliban
Afghanistan is enormous. After years of denial, Afghans are
reaching out to embrace new ideas, technology and 
expertise. School buildings are bursting with children eager 
to learn from a handful of teachers determined to teach.

authorities have drawn up a series of
projects aimed at developing a national
education strategy, UNESCO is seeking
$27 million from donors to meet the
country’s most urgent education needs, In
particular the rehabilitation of Kabul
University to jump-start higher education,
training for education managers and
teachers, and the development of non-
formal and distance education to tackle
one of the world’s highest rates of
illiteracy.

### 380093: Afghanistan: A nation at the crossroads

Afghanistan
Women face a complex web of challenges
as they seek to rebuild their role in Afghan
society. Despite the fall of the Taliban,
deeply conservative values towards
gender still dominate Afghanistan’s social
structure. Few women yet feel confident
enough to walk the streets without the
Burka.
Afghan women, who make up an
estimated 60 percent of the population,
are “the highest stakeholders of peace,
stability and development,” says Dr.
Noeleen Hayzer, executive director of
United Nations Development Fund for
Women (UNIFEM). “They have the most
to gain from new opportunities and also
the most to lose if fragile communities
breakdown.”
Fundamental issues faced by women
include: severe food insecurity - their
removal from the economic sphere by the
Taliban meant that many women without
male breadwinners were reduced to
beggars; one of the poorest healthcare
systems in the world; the need to make up
for years of limited or no access to
education; and widespread fear of violence.
The Chair of the human Rights
Commission, Dr. Sima Samar, says that
“security is not only about ending the war
and silencing the weapons, but it is about
ensuring women and girls can live in
safety and dignity.” She emphasized the
need for national identification cards,
which would ensure women’s right to
engage in the political process as voters
and representatives. At present, only one
to two percent of women in Afghanistan
have identity cards, meaning that almost
98 percent of women are people without
citizenship or identities, and therefore
could be excluded from participating in
elections due in 2004. 
The unprecedented step of setting up a
Ministry of Women’s Affairs for the first
time in Afghan history was a start to
addressing the grave situation of women
and the inequities that developed between
the genders under the Taliban. But
advancing the cause of women within the
context of current conditions will take time
and require fundamental changes in the
social, economic and political areas.
The MoWA must walk a fine line,
balancing traditional values towards
gender issues with modern perspectives
that advocate pushing forward quickly to
address gender inequities. Thus, in order
to make advances, MoWA will move
incrementally rather than taking an overt
and accelerated approach.
Women reclaiming their livesRestructuring the country requires
educated and qualified Afghans. Over the
past two decades, however, Afghanistan
lost an estimated 200,000 teachers and
academics and its 17 universities and
institutes were left devastated by war.
“The immediate priority is to upgrade
and pay present teachers – some of whom
have been cut off from developments in
the outside world for many years and
haven’t been paid for months,” says
UNESCO Kabul education coordinator
Professor Lutfulla Safi. “Next we must
hire and train new teachers, and replace
outdated curricula and text books.” 
Major questions to be addressed in the
long term, says Safi, include the choice of
teaching languages, defining the contents
of school textbooks and curricula, co-
education and the place of religion in
education. On these, he warns, “we must
move carefully.” 
A vital part of the learning process for
many Afghans is the gaining of foreign
language expertise and the development
of new technology applications, such as
computers,” says UNESCO’s Kabul
Education consultant Professor Ed Burke.
To meet this need, it is proposed that
UNESCO and UNDP, in collaboration with
international partners, establish a
Knowledge and Language Center in
Kabul.
UNESCO is also planning the launch of
a major community radio programme to
provide basic education for those who for
nearly 25 years have been excluded from
all types of educational systems, women
in particular.

UNESCO
and Afghanistan
“The (1949) Mission, wishes at
the beginning of this report to
present its views on a question
which it regards as being one of
transcendent importance. It
believes that the education of
women is a matter for first
consideration in attempting to
set up a truly modern school
system in Afghanistan. 
The Mission cannot mince
words on this issue and still
discharge its duty faithfully to
the Royal Government of
Afghanistan. Either the country
must educate its girls in
elementary and secondary
schools, must train women
teachers, must provide adult
and technical education for
women, and must give some of
its outstanding women
university education at home or
abroad; or it must resign itself
to a backward status
economically, socially, and
culturally, in relation to its near
neighbours, to other countries
of the Islamic world, and to
modern States everywhere.
There is no other other
solution.”
A
fghanistan became a
member of UNESCO on
May 4 1948. Already in
December that year an agreement
was signed between the Government
of Afghanistan and UNESCO, setting
out the terms under which the
Organization engaged to send expert
consultants to Afghanistan,
competent to study the educational
problems of that country and to
report on them. The experts stayed in
Afghanistan from August 20 to
October 28, 1949. During their
mission they visited schools in most
districts of the country. The final
report was published in English and
French in 1952. Special emphasis was
given to the education of girls and
women.
In the years following this first
educational mission an extensive
collaboration between UNESCO and
Afghanistan took place, in particular
in the educational field but also in
culture and science. In 1962 a team
of five UNESCO experts wrote “A
Survey of Education” in Afghanistan
in which they summarised the
development and progress in the field
of education since 1949.

In the report from the 1962 mission
(left) the authors note that
“progress made since 1949 is
illuminating” (see table below).
The report continues: “perhaps the most
pleasing and encouraging feature is not
revealed by the statistics at all; and this is the
quality of the work in girls’ schools, even in
remote provincial areas. There was a fresh
keenness in the approach to learning, a
proper pride in the excellent results achieved
for example in reading, writing, arithmetic
and needlework, an awareness of the
significance of environment, including
cleanliness and order, all reflected in the girls’
obvious love of school and eagerness to
attend regularly. The young women teachers,
untrained as they were, had achieved quite
remarkable results and clearly have natural
ability, which, if properly developed and
mobilised, could change not only the
education for girls, but primary education as a
whole, and within this generation.”

### 127886: Action, rolling!

“I remember:
we left Saint
Petersburg (Russian
Federation) during the
winter. I was afraid of
what awaited me in
my new home
country.  At first, it
was the heat in Israel
that surprised me, and
the children who
spoke a language I
couldn’t understand.
Then I learned the
language and made
friends.”
Iliya is nine years
old.  Like thousands
of children aged from
nine to 15, he
participated in a
writing contest for
aspiring short film (10-
15 minutes) and
cartoon makers
sponsored by
television channels
from around the world
— from Chile to
China, passing through
Belgium, Hungary,
Ireland, Israel and
Italy.
The winners
gathered in Treviso,
Italy, from May 27 to
June 2 to present their
works at the
international CIAK*
Junior Festival.
Created by the Alcuni
group, a cultural
association that
produces youth
programming, the
event is sponsored by
UNESCO and the
International Council
for Cinema, Television
and Audiovisual
Communication
(CICT).
The children’s
works were judged by
groups made up of
directors, psychologists
and teachers. Some
6,000 scripts were
received in Italy, while
20,000 entries came
from China. In Israel,
“Moving”, Iliya’s film,
was selected. At the
festival, his work
received the prize for
best group of actors
and UNESCO’s Fellini
medal.
But the work of two
classes of students
from the Belgian city
of Bruges took home
the festival’s prize for
best film. “Shadows”
tells the story of
Hanne, a teenager who
goes blind.  The issues
confronted by the
students are serious
but their message
remains positive: make
peace, protect the
environment...
This festival —
where children get to
be creators, actors and
spectators at the same
time — highlights the
educative role that
television can play in
children’s lives.  For
Damir Dijakovic, from
UNESCO’s Venice
office, the CIAK Junior
festival has become “a
place where those who
want television to be
instructive can
brainstorm.”

### 380094: Cubes and spheres

Cubes and spheres
The
Earth Institute at
Columbia University
(USA) and UNESCO
have teamed up in a new project to assist
local communities around the globe to
adapt to rapid environmental and social
change. Called CUBES (Columbia Earth
Institute/UNESCO Joint Programme on
Biosphere and Society), it will focus on
five key issues: water, energy, health,
agriculture, and biodiversity.
In one of the CUBES projects, the
practices of pastoral Masaï herdsmen from
the grassland plains of Kenya will be
compared with those of ranchers from the
borderlands of Arizona and New Mexico
in the USA. Like many of their American
counterparts, the Masaï are slowly
abandoning their pastoral way of life and
turning to sedentary ranching. But there is
some evidence that when herders switch
to sedentary cattle farming, the local
grasslands cannot sustain the increase in
grazing intensity, while farmers abandon
their cultural traditions and drift to the
towns. Meanwhile, others blame pastoral
grazing for desertification, following the
destruction of forest and thicket.
CUBES is initially running five other
projects. In the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) the programme will work
with the UNESCO-sponsored Regional
Graduate School of Tropical Forestry at
the University of Kinshasa in a
“knowledge-networking” initiative on
malaria prevention, conservation and
reducing poverty. In another project, the
Tonle Sap Great Lake area (Cambodia), a
UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, is the focus
of a strategy to reduce conflicts over
natural resources. The other sites for the
moment are the Amazon floodplain of
Peru, Cape Floral Kingdom Urban
ecosystem in Cape Town (South Africa)
and New York, where discussions are
continuing on developing the city as a
prototype urban biosphere reserve (see
New Courier, 4 May 2002).
Columbia set up its Earth Institute in
1996 with a palette of programmes geared
towards global sustainability. The aim
was to find a new way to practice science
for the benefit of both rich and poor, by
bringing scientific knowledge and
technology to bear on problems as diverse
as the impact of El Nino on Peruvian
anchovy fishermen and arsenic
contaminated water in Bangladesh. 
In May 2001 Columbia and UNESCO
jointly held an international conference in
New York on Biodiversity and Society that
paved the way for CUBES one year later.
The nine case studies presented at the
meeting looked at new forms of
partnership to resolve the conflicting
interests of stakeholders in fragile
environments, such as grasslands in
Chihuahua (Mexico) and tropical
mountains in Yunan (China). The meeting
also launched the controversial idea of
New York as an urban biosphere reserve.

### 380094: Young people rally to fight AIDS

On
September 13,
UNESCO signed
an agreement
to conduct a joint campaign 
for peace, understanding and
cultural diversity with the
International Youth Hostels
Federation, which has some
3.2 million members. The
Federation is one of a network
of about 60 major youth
organizations working in
partnership with UNESCO’s
Youth Coordination Unit*: they
include national, regional and
international federations;
student, professional, religious,
and rural associations; as well
as “heavyweights,” such as the
Red Cross and Red Crescent
societies; Christian youth groups
such as the YMCA and the
YWCA. Together they have
hundreds of millions of
members, all potential bearers 
of UNESCO’s message and news
of its work.
The Thai Youth Hostels
Association (TYHA) for
example, has joined in the 2002-
03 World AIDS Campaign,
whose youth activities are
coordinated by UNESCO. As
every year, people thronged the
streets of Thailand’s towns and
cities to celebrate the Queen’s
birthday on August 12, which,
for the last three years, has also
been World Youth Day. On this
occasion, TYHA members
marched through the streets on
Bangkok and handed out
information leaflets to passers
by. “We organized two marches
and I think at least 40,000
people got our message,” said
Promvit Klampaiboon, assistant
director of the Association and a
regional official of the Asia-
Pacific youth hostel movement.
“INFOPILLS”
ONLINE
In Bangladesh on the same day,
dozens of youth association
leaders attended a conference on
the role of young people in
HIV/AIDS prevention planning,
held with the participation of
the country’s education and
youth ministers. In Nigeria, the
Aba-based NGO Eziukwu 2
Community Partners for Health
provided prevention training to
150 young people who will in
turn train others. In the
Democratic Republic of Congo,
TOMISA, an information and
help centre for young people,
has launched a counselling
service to encourage people to
get tested for the disease.
Young people aged between
15 and 24 account for about half
of all new HIV infections – or
about 6,500 new infections
every day. Ignorance and
prejudice concerning the disease
are serious obstacles to
treatment and prevention, which
is why information is so vital.
The website of UNESCO’s
Youth Coordination Unit*
provides access to practical
proposals for action based on a
cultural approach and respectful
of human rights in fighting the
disease. The site also serves as a
permanent clearing-house for
organizations belonging to the
Youth Network and frequent and
brief messages, “infopills”, keep
them abreast of the latest
developments.
UNESCO’s ties with youth
organizations are not new. In
1993, it signed a cooperation
agreement with the International
Student Travel Confederation
(ISTC), which issues an
International Student Identity
Card recognized by more than
100 countries. Since then,
UNESCO’s logo has featured on
the card, held by some
4.5 million students worldwide.

The
United Nations Foundation 
(UNF), in partnership 
with UNESCO’s World
Heritage Center, has undertaken to free up
more than six million dollars to help
maintain biodiversity in the world.  These
funds will be added to the 5.41 million
dollars pledged by non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) to help conserve
natural world heritage sites in Brazil and
central Africa.
The 10-year world heritage development
programme in Brazil - aimed at preserving
exceptionally rich ecosystems at 38
protected sites across the country - will be
launched in early 2003.  The Brazilian
government has invested one million
dollars in the project.  This initiative will
notably affect five sites on the World
Heritage List: Iguaçu National Park
(pictured above), Discovery Coast Atlantic
Forest Reserves, Atlantic Forest Southeast
Reserves, the Pantanal Conservation Area
and Jau National Park.  The programme’s
NGO partners include the Nature
Conservancy, Conservation International
(CI), and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).
The initiative for the forests of central
Africa aims to improve the management of
three national parks in the Congo River
Basin.  These protected woodlands, home
to rich ecosystems with numerous types of
primates, are located in Gabon, the Central
African Republic, Cameroon and the
Democratic Republic of Congo.  The goal is
to improve park management and to crack
down on bushmeat poaching, while getting
local residents involved in forest
conservation efforts.
90 PERCENT LOST 
BY 2030
According to a recent study published by
the UN Environment Programme (UNEP),
more than 90 percent of natural habitats for
large primates will disappear by the year
2030 if road systems, mining infrastructure
networks and poaching continue to grow at
the current pace.  Five NGOs and the UN
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) are
participating in the initiative, along with
several African governments and UNESCO’s
World Heritage Center.

children in distress since
1995, when he donated
to  250,000 DM (127,822
Euros) to UNESCO. Why?
To help put children “on
the right track”.  Because
“if they take the wrong
road, if they don’t have
any opportunities, they’ll
have a difficult life and
cause trouble for
everyone around them.”
The solution?
Sport is certainly one.
“Kids love to play –
football, anything.  Sport
lets them have a good
time and also gives them
an aim, a chance to
respond to challenges, to
win, to achieve
something.”
The champion has
contributed a total of
1.5 million euros to
several UNESCO projects,
including: the construc-
tion of a school in Dakar
(Senegal) and
improvements to the
“Baraka” slum in the
city,  carried out with the
NGO Enda Third World;
support for a clinic for
child victims of war in
Sarajevo, and a “Palace
for the Poor” in Lima
(Peru). “Nowadays,
certain projects attract
lots of donors,” he says.
“Then there are others
you never hear about.
Those are the ones I’m
interested in.”

### 127894: In the wake of the floods

“I
n Dessau (home of the Bauhaus School),
where the Mulde and Elbe Rivers come
together, we’re used to floods. But this year
was catastrophic,” says Christine Lambrecht, the
vice-president of the Association of German World
Heritage Sites. 
Response to the disaster was immediate: “the
solidarity was incredible”. Thousands of firemen and
citizens, of all ages and from all walks of life,
worked side by side to evacuate the basements of the
city’s monuments and pile sandbags to hold back
the raging waters.
This spontaneous and generalized mobilization
saved Dessau from the worst.
However, other European cities hit by last August’s
floods, did not fare so well. Despite the valiant
efforts of the inhabitants, many places –
particularly in the Czech Republic – were severely
damaged. 
From the outset, UNESCO called on the
international community to help reconstitute and
restore the archives, libraries and other cultural
properties that had been devastated.
To facilitate the task, an information site has been
opened on the internet to guide those who wish to
offer their support to the worst hit cultural
institutions. It can be visited at:
http://www.unesco.org/webworld/index.shtml
A few days after the flooding had reached its height,
UNESCO’s photo bank sent photographer
Niamh Burke to record the damage at sites included
on the World Heritage List, and some that would like
to be.
All photos are free of copyright restrictions for non-commercial use,
provided that UNESCO and the name of the photographer are mentioned.

Harmony in the shape
of a garden
Make a virtual visit
www.unesco.org/visit/jardin/
Just
at the foot of the
building dedicated to
it, peace has its
garden. It was built by sculptor Isamu
Noguchi (1904-88), who has given what
he called “a personal twist” to the
principles of Japanese gardening,
because “the Japanese tradition allows
for the greatest latitude.”
“This is an ambulatory garden,” said
Noguchi. “To truly enjoy (it), you must
walk around it.” Strolling around its
1,700 square metres, the visitor will
discover a rich counterpoint of recurrent
motifs: a pond in the middle shaped as
an ideogram signifying a “pure heart”, a
footbridge bordered by flowers straight
out of kabuki theatre, a place for open-
air tea ceremonies, granite cobblestones,
a stream and a lantern providing
e
symbolic light that protects and purifies.
The artist went to the Japanese island
of Shikoku to select the rocks for his
work. He tested his design there – the
stone sides of the lake, the bridge and
the lanterns, before shipping 88 tonnes
of rock to Paris. Three Japanese
gardeners were sent to UNESCO to set
them in place. “Any gardener will tell
you it’s the rocks that make a garden,”
said Noguchi. “They call them its
bones.” Cherry trees, bamboo, camellias
and ornamental maple trees were
planted.
Inscribed on the fountain – which is
the highest stone, chosen for its
beautiful shape – is the word “peace”
(hei wa) in Japanese characters, written
back-to-front so it can be read as a
reflection in the water. The Angel of
Nagasaki, a sculpture from the city’s
Urakami church that survived the atom
bomb attack, watches over this magical
spot.

Sustainable Development
from A to Z
“Only after the last tree has been cut down,
Only after the last fish has been caught,
Only after the last river has been poisoned,
Only then will you realize that money cannot be eaten.”
This Cree Indian prophecy opens the three-volume
Knowledge for Sustainable Development, which
accompanies the gigantic web-based Encyclopedia of Life
Support Systems (EOLSS) - the largest and most
comprehensive publication to date on sustainable
development. 
Ten years in the planning, the online encyclopedia is the
only series to comprehensively examine the origins and
threats facing all of the systems that support life on Earth
- from the climate to the world’s oceans, forests, water
cycle and atmosphere. Contributions from 5,000
scientists in over 100 countries offer step-by-step
explanations on techniques for applying abstract or pure
sciences, such as mathematical models to assess
environmental pollution or to predict food consumption
patterns. However, technical solutions alone won’t
resolve the current ecological crisis. EOLSS therefore
covers a diverse range of social issues - from
international human rights law and poverty eradication
to the psychology of religion. 
The aim is to offer a guide and reference for a wide
range of users: from natural and social scientists to
engineers, economists, educators, university students and

UNESCO | the new Courier | October 2002
professors, conservationists, entrepreneurs, law and policy-
makers. EOLSS goes beyond the raw information and data to
serve as a kind of expert advisor. The various chapters are
divided into different levels of specialization to cater to a diverse
readership. General readers might turn to EOLSS for summaries
on nuclear energy, for example, while university students focus
on explanations of related principles as policy-makers turn to the
future perspectives and related recommendations.
UNESCO organized the project with EOLSS Publishers, based in
Oxford (Great Britain). It already contains about 25 million
words, equivalent to about 50,000 standard pages, and several
thousand tables, graphics, boxes and photographs. Within the
next two years, it will mature to its full size of about 70 million
words (equivalent to about 150 volumes) through regular updates
as often as once every three months.
The three printed volumes Knowledge for Sustainable
Development was released simultaneously with the online version
of EOLSS. They present a selection of articles written for a broad
readership along with an overview of the main issues dealt with
in the encyclopedia. Beyond this introductory insight, essential to
grasp the global relevance of each main theme, each article
provides a listing of its specialized in-depth treatment online. 
Access to the EOLSS online is by subscription, via the
website http://www.eolss.net. Subscription rates will
vary, depending on the applicant. Universities from the
UN list of Least Developed Countries will have free
access for one year, renewable subject to submission of
annual reports of educational and research activity.
Likewise, disadvantaged individuals registered through
charitable organizations will also be entitled to free
access for one year.
Universities and public libraries can subscribe for two
years for US$3000 and individuals will be charged
US$300 for the same period. Governments and
corporations will pay slightly higher rates that are still
significantly lower than those of commercial
publications.

History
of Civilizations
of Central Asia
A six-volume work on the cultures that
flourished and vanished from the down of
civilization to the present time in the
heartland of Eurasia, stretching from the
Caspian Sea to the borders of China. 
Available volumes:
Volume I: The Dawn of Civilization: Earliest Times
to 700 B.C.
Volume II: The Development of Sedentary and
Nomadic Civilizations: 700 B.C. to A.D. 250
Volume III: The Crossroads of Civilization: A.D.
250 to 750
Volume IV: The Age of Achievement A.D. 750 to
the End of the Fifteenth Century (in two parts)
Coming early 2003:
Volume V: Development in contrast: from the
Sixteenth to the mid-Nineteenth Century
The period treated in this volume is highlighted by
the slow retreat of nomadism and the progressive
increase of sedentary polities owing to a
fundamental change in military technology.
Furthermore, this period certainly saw a growing
contrast in the pace of economic and cultural
progress between Central Asia and Europe. The
internal growth of the European economies and
the influx of silver from the New World gave
Atlantic Europe an increasingly important position
in world trade and caused a major shift in inland
Asian trade. Thus, 1850 marks the end of the total
sway of pre-modern culture as the extension of
colonial dominance was accompanied by the influx
of modern ideas.

Lacquerware
in Asia,
Today and
Yesterday
Dating back several thousand
years in Chinese history, the art
of lacquer can claim to be one
of the most ancient and
venerable expressions of Asian
culture. But this traditional
knowledge, so firmly rooted in
people’s daily life, is under
threat. Over the past decades,
the number of people employed
in the lacquerware workshops,
and particularly the younger
generation, has fallen
dramatically all over Asia. 
This book offers a
comprehensive picture of both
lacquer creative arts and
craftsmanship, allowing the
reader to compare the different
methods and materials used in
Cambodia, China, India, Korea,
Japan Myanmar, Thailand and
Viet Nam. It underlines the
importance of documenting past
and modern procedures,
including knowledge of raw
materials and techniques.

Children of
Thula Mntwana
Growing up in cities
Like people in 13 percent of all
homes in South Africa, thirteen-
year-old Sukiswa lives in a
shanty settlement. She explains
how her family became
squatters in Thula Mntwana
near Johannesburg. Despite the
daily struggle for survival and
an exposure to violence,
Zukiswa and other children try
to live like any other children in
the world. She tells of how she
and other children learned,
through the UNESCO-MOST
"Growing Up In Cities" project,
to identify problems in their
environment and of their
invitation by the mayor to
present their insights to public
officials.
