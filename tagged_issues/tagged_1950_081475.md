FALLACIES OF RACISM EXPOSED
UNESCO PUBLISHES
DECLARATION BY-'
WORLD'S SCIENTISTS
MORE than fifteen years ago, men and womenof goodwill proposed to publish an inter-
national declaration which would expose
"racial"discrimination and"racial"hatred as
unscientific and false, as well as ugly and inhuman.
The world at that time was running downhill
toward World War II, and so-called"practical"
considerations prevented publication of the state-
ment-even if they could not prevent the war.
False myths and superstitions about race
contributed directly to the war, and to the murder
of peoples which became known as genocide-but
victims of the war were of all colours and of all
"races". Despite the universality of this agony and
destruction, the myths and superstitions still
survive-and still threaten the whole of mankind.
The need for a sound unchallengeable statement of
the facts, to counter this continuing threat, is a
matter of urgency.
Accordingly, Unesco has called together a group
of the world's most noted scientists, in the fields o !
biology, genetics, psychology, sociology and anthro-
pology. These scientists have prepared a historic
declaration of the known facts about human race,
which is reprinted in this issue of the Courier.
Unesco offers this declaration as a weapon-and
a practical weapon-to all men and women of
goodwill who are engaged in the good fight for
human brotherhood. Here is an official summary
of the conclusions reached in the declaration :
. In matters of race, the only characteristics which
anthropologists can effectively use as a basis for
classifications are physical and physiological.
. According to present knowledge, there is no
proof that the groups of mankind differ in their innate
mental characteristics, whether in respect of intelli-
gence or temperament. The scientific evidence
indicates that the range of mental capacities in all
ethnic groups is much the same.
. Historical and sociological studies support
the view that the genetic differences are not of impor-
tance in determining the social and cultural diffe-
rences between different groups of Homo sapiens
and that the social and cultural changes in different
groups have, in the main, been independent of
changes in inborn constitution. Vast social changes
have occurred which were not in any way connected
with changes in racial type.
. There is no evidence that race mixture as such
produces bad results from the biological point of
view. The social results of race mixture, whether
for good or ill, are to be traced to social factors.
. All normal human beings are capable of learning
to share in a common life, to understand the nature
of mutual service and reciprocity, and to respect
social obligations and contracts. Such biological
differences as exist between members of different
ethnic groups have no relevance to problems of
social and political organization, moral life and
communication between human beings.
Lastly, biological studies lend support to the ethic
of universal brotherhood ; for man is born with drives
toward co-operation, and unless these drives are
satisfied, men and nations alike fall ill. Man is born
a social being, who can reach his fullest development
only through interaction with his fellows. The denial
at any point of this social bond between man and
man brings with it disintegration. In this sense,
every man is his brother's keeper. For every man is
a piece of the continent, a part of the main, because
he is involved in mankind.

### 81477: A Hundred groups with a common aim

A HUNDRED GROUPS
WITH A
COMMON AIM
This is the third in a series of special
articles describing the work of some of
the 100 international non-governmental
organizations whose co-operation with
Unesco helps the accomplishment of
its programme.
On the masthead of the Courier, and on an e'Ver-ir. ! creasing number of
. publications in the world of m. ts and letters, you sele Unesco's
insignia-the familiar Gree ! k temple, with the initials of the
oi'Ylwization fonning the columns ae1'OSS the fi'ont, This classic façadc
is not merely symbolic of Unesco's purposes in pi'omoting the free
Cfchange of knowledge and educated thought, but actually represents some
of the work which Unesco encourages.
In the publication Fasti Archaeolo-
gici, for example, one comes across a
picture of the restored temple of
Augustus, at Pola, Italy, an original
building in this architectural form
which we have inherited from ancient
Greece. This book, published with
Unesco aid, by the International Asso-
ciation for Classical Archaeology, sur-
veys the classical acquisitions of differ-
ent countries, with photographs of
restored monuments, statues, and bas-
relief, coins and pottery. Its purpose
is to familiarize specialists in the civi-
lizations of archaic and classic Greece,
pre-historic Italy and early Rome, and
ancient Syrian and Christian cultures
with the work that is going On in their
fields of study.
As anthropologists trace the origins
of myth and tradition, and linguists
the origins of language, archaelogists
uncover the physical aspects of the
past. The world they restore is one
in which distinctions of form and co-
lour, custom and language are not
barriers, but elements in the growth
and development of the modern world.
CORPUS VASORUM ANTIQUORUM
Most of the work done by the inter-national organizations which are
working under consultative ar-
rangements with Unesco is concentrat-
ed in specific fields of activity.
Sometimes their achievements mean
little or nothing to the average man,
but the results of their study and
research are reflected in many aspects
of life which he takes for granted. A
school of English decorators, for ins-
tance, is now studying artistic forms
dating back to the drawings of the
cave-men, to adapt them to modem
mural painting.
In the field of research in ancient
artistic form and design, an impor-
tant contribution is being made by the
International Academic Union, with
the help of a grant from Unesco.
This work is the preparation of a
series of books, the Corpus Vasorum
Antiquorum, on ceramic collections in
France, Italy, Spain, Greece and the
United States.
An instalment is being prepared in
England on early Australian and New
Zealand pottery. Another volume is
devoted to the Swedish collection of
ceramics of Mediterranean countries,
the Near East, Cyprus and Greece, and
a further one deals with the collection
of the National Museum of Copen-
hagen. These comparative studies in-
clude the origins of shapes and subject
matter of design, and the names of the
pottery-makers and designers.
FROM ALCHEMY TO AN ATLAS
An even better example of some ofth  highly speci lized work of the
International Academic Union is
the catalogue of Latin manuscripts on
Alchemy which it is compiling.
Unesco's interest in such a project is
its vital contribution to the history of
science, since alchemy has been called
the"prelude to chemistry".
This group is also at work on a dic-
tionary of mediaeval Latin, which was
the lingua franca, the international
language of scholars and artists for
over eight-hundred years of western
civilization's development. Ten coun-
tries are co-operating in this work,
which will be assembled at the French
Institute. France has already two-
hundred-and-sixty-thousand card-
index notes as its part of the work.
In this field of languages, the Per-
manent International Committee of
Linguists is working, with Unesco's aid
on the production of a highly-technic-
al linguistics atlas, which will indicate
the spread of cultural bounderies
beyond national frontiers, and the
inter-mixture of peoples beyond politic-
al barriers. This Committee is also
at work on a dictionary and grammar
of the almost extinct Tasmanian lan-
guage.
Other studies of extinct languages
have gone far to prove the vast extent
of migrations of pre-historic peoples,

movements of such tremendous scope
that they were not equalled again
until the fifteenth century. What is
believed to be the proto-Indian script,
for instance, has been found as far
east as the Oceanic islands-a remark-
able achievement of colonization for
people with the most primitive sea-
faring equipment.
MUSIC-A UNIVERSAL MEDIUM
But if artistic and linguistic studiestell of a universal inheritanc
from the past, how much more
universal a medium is music. In
January of this year, the International
Music Council was formed under
Unesco's auspices to co-ordinate the
work of independent musical groups.
At present, with the aid of such mem-
ber organizations as the International
Society for Contemporary Music and
the International Society for Musical
Research, the Council is working on
two Unesco projects, a world catalogue
of recorded music, and the establish-
ment of a universal musical pitch.
Even though we may never have
studied music and can hardly tell one
pitch from another, we would realize
that something was wrong if we heard
instruments at a concert playing at
different pitches.
Before a concert, we hear one ins-
trument, usually the oboe, sound a
note, and the other instruments tune
to the same pitch. But the"A"of
Paris is not quite the same as that of
London, and it is still slightly differ-
ent in Vienna. An internationally-
established pitch would not only ease
the work of musicians playing with
foreign orchestras, but would also
help instrument builders.
A CHANCE FOR YOUNG COMPOSERS
Each of the international musicalorganizations working with
Unesco was originally founded to
bring together men in specialized
fields of musical work. The Interna-
tional Society of Musical Research is
a group of musicologists, who special-
ize in such studies as the history and
theory of composition, counterpoint
and harmony. Their bulletin, regu-
larly published in the various langua-
ges of the members, contains articles
and reviews of new books on music,
and lists new musical publications.
Another group, the International
Society for Contemporary Music was
formed in 1922,
Successful concerts have been given
in Salzburg, the birthplace of Mozart,
and Vienna, Venice, Geneva and Ox-
ford, where young composers conduct
their own music. This Society is
making a choice of the works of
worth-while contemporary composers
for Unesco's projected record-library,
which will give young composers,
whose music is not yet played extensi-
vely by large orchestras, the chance to
be heard.
The history of music and art is a
record of talent enriched and deve-
loped through exchange of work and
ideas. These are the foundations on
which the independent international
organizations contributing work from
their specialized fields to Unesco are
built.

### 81480: UNESCO faces the problem of peace

* FTER four weeks of frequently heated discussions, the Fifth General
/\ Conference has come to an end. If the debates of this Assembly
have presented a new aspect,'it is this : Unesco finds that it must
face up to one of those contradictions of which our age gives so many
examples. The tasks undertaken are in the interests of a more stable
peace, but they will on) v reach fruition during peace. It is a question
of long-therm projects : will there be sufficient time ? Will those threats
which weigh so heavily on the world today allow, the forces of peace
enough time to become established and to triumph ?
However difficult the solution, the problem confronting the General
Conference of Unesco, was neverthe-
less very clear : \Vas its duty to conti-
nue as if nothing was wrong, to confine
itself to technical projects, unquestion-
ably useful but producing results only
in the distant future ? Or, on the con-
trary, was its duty to accept the world
as it is, admit its division, its problems,
and to take immediate steps to fight
those dangers imposed by the constant
threat of war ? The final decisions of
the General Conference were inspired
by the need to reply to such questions ;
questions indeed which constantly ab-
sorbed the representatives of all the
59 member states of the Organisation.
For this reason, though still continu-
:  its long term projects, Unesco has
at the same''me launched itself on a
new path. The ConieÌ't0e has charged
the Executive Council and the lJ ! rectors
General to submit a certain number 0 :
special projects which will attempt
"more directly and in the framework
of the United Nations and its partieutar
department, to support and consolidate
peace".
Positive Action
For World Stability
IT was foreseen that the importanceand sc p  of these projects would
be so great that the ordinary budget.
of Unesco would not be sufficient to
finance them. The Conference there-
fore decided that they could be Jlnanced
"by voluntary contributions 01'Titoney
from private and public sources or'Í/ !
,'el'l'ices trom as many countries as pos-
sidle". By such projects Unesco will
take positive steps toward immediate
relief for the world's present intellec-
tual and moral instability, in propor-
tion to the means put at its disposal
and in the framework of its competence.
Two proposals (presented by the U. S.
delegation) relating to matters such as
these, have been approved by the Con-
ferenè". The first charges Unesco to or-
ganise and put) mC eet a major pro-
gramme"/Lith a view to aÙ' : : : cHlg 1/1-
ternational understanding in German ? i".
The other requests Unesco to set up re-
gional centres of scientific research the
first of which will be in Western Eu-
rope. These centres, established by
means of funds collected by Unesco
outside its normal budget, will help to
remove that monopoly of scientific re-
search which the present high cost of
modern apparatus gives to countries
rich enough to afford its construction.
The moral and intellectual instability
which Unesco is trying to remedy, par-
tially originates in the differences that
become more and more apparent bet-
ween industrial countries and less fa-
vouredregionsof tile globe. Thelatter
are becommg more impoverished every
d2y and their resources continually di-
minisll ; the power of the former grows
all the time and modern techniques en-
sure a way of life that, becomes in-
creasingly easier.
The United Nations'plan of tech-
nical assistance to countries that
are insufficiently developed has been
conceived to answer this problem.
In 1951, L'nesco will play an important
role in putting this plan into effect. In
addition, it will undertake specific
works of its own. in this field. Thus, an
international conference on"The COII-
quest of the desert"is going to meet in
Israel, in collaboration with the Inter-
national Institute of the Arid Zone,
which Unesco is at present setting up.
However, despite the great importance
of these matters, they do not represent
a full solution. many conflicts arise
from the inequality of'man. Others re-
sult ; ; ; : ! ! l different causes. There are,

### 74378: What is not good for humanity as a whole cannot be good for any nation, race or individual

"Wha't is not good for Humanity as a whole cannot be
good for any nation, race or individual"
Jaime Torres ßodt, t
Addressing the final session
of UNESCO's Fifth General
Conference, M. Jaime Torres
Bodet, Unesco's Director-
General, summed up his im-
pressions of results achiev-
ed. Below, we reproduce
the full text of his speech.
M. Jaime Torres Bodet, Unesco's Director-General, speaking at a plenary session of the
Fifth General Conference. in the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence.
MAY I say how pleased I am at the adoption of the
resolution you have just passed unanimously. In
all sincerity, I believe that is is the perfect
complement to that approved by the Programme
and Budget Commission yesterday evening on the
motion of a number of Delegations and confirmed by
yourselves this morning. Taken together, the two
resolutions. reveal a will to peace which does honour to
this Conference and testifies to the fidelity of all of us
to Unesco's supreme ideal.
At this stage, when you are bringing your work to a
close, I feel it to be necessary to give you my absolutely
frank opinion on the results achieved. I had hoped that
this session of the Conference might mark a decisive
stage in the development of our Organization. It would
be going too far to suggest that that hope has been fully
satisfied. The characteristic note of this Conference has
been less one of decision than of heart-searching and,
in certain matters, of clarification. That, of course, is
not all that we could have wished, but it is a great deal.
As trees are judged
YOU have defined a basic programme which hadnever previously been explicitly stated. You have
defined a list of methods, which had not previously
been made. You have defined a policy of recc-mmend-
ations and conventions which will, I am convinced, be
fruitful in the years to come. An excellent instance of
what we can secure by these means is the agreement
on the free importation of educational, scientific and
cultural material, whose ratification you are recom-
mending to your governments. You have recorded your
intention of inceasing Unesco's resources and have
p : omised to do it by trying to overcome the financial
difficulties arising from arrangements necessarily tem-
porary, but which could not be better in view of the
criteria adopted regarding the establishment of a budget
ceiling.
It would be premature to express any views as to the
wo'th of these results. As trees are judged by their
fruit, so the resolutions of an international conference
are judged by the action in which they issue. What
happens in the year which lies before us will, in my
view, be of vital importance to this Organization. We
must be vigilant to ensure that the work of the Secre-
tariat and the activities of Member States in matters
within Unesco's sphere are more effectively integrated
than they have so far been. We must plan bo ! d amd
simple tasks, for the better service of peace through
education, science and culture. We must secure action
within each Member State to spur rulers and private
bodies to augment the slender financial resources at our
disposal.
All defiøitioD is difficult
FOR all this two things are essential : mutual trustand mutual understanding. But can we really do bt
that we shall find that spirit of trust and under-
standing ? We are met in a country which, in its
greatest epoch, was governed by a sage, the philosopher-
emperor Marcus Aurelius, the author of the profound
epigram :"What is not good for the hive, cannot be
good for the bee". Its application to our own age is
obvious. What is not good for humanity as a whole
cannot be good for any nation, race or individual. That,
surely, is an exact definition of the intellectual and
moral solidarity of the peoples to which Unesco is dedi-
cated.
This has been a difficult Conference, because all
definition is difficult. Let us, then, pray that the diffi-
culties may lead to a more conscious effort to see clearly
in the future so that we may all more effectively serve
the noble aims of Unesco.
It is with that prayer in my heart that I thank you
for your work and offer to Italy, in the person of Sena-
tor Jacini, our warmest gratitude for the generous hospi-
tality she has afforded us.
. The texts of the two resctutions refen-ed to by the
Dtrector-GeTter'aZ will be sound on page 7 of this issue.

### 81480: UNESCO faces the problem of peace

Îuï ëmple, conflicts, whose origin
remain ulJscuì'"vhich occur even
within a nation, between dlC :'"'sth-
nic groups. Unesco, in pursuing en-
quirks into various states of social ten-
sion, is making a study of these obscure
causal factors. It is important to know
not only the obstacles which oppose
harmonious relations betvveen different
groups, but also the factors which have
brought about good relations in certain
regions.
Unesco has decided to u ! Hlc'. lake, ; Üs
year an enquiry into economic, politi-
cal, cultural and psychological factors
which"aid or hinder harmonious rela-
tions betu ; een races and ethnic groups",< ! / : f< t<t< ; <'e) t rac a ; t f/t) ti  roM ".
This enquiry win be launched in Bra-
zil, which country, to quote the Bra-
zilian delegate at the General Confer-
ence,"progresses in fraternity between
its ever-increasing black, white and
Indian population".
A Step Towards Universality
I XTEHXATIOXAL understanding, whichis one of the íixed aims of Unesco
as stated in its Constitution, can only
be facilitated by works such as these
which, moreover, are directly allied to
all the tasks undertaken by l'nesco-
studies related to states of social ten-
sion, dissemination of scientific data
with respect to racial problems, di1'lu-
sion and promotion of the rights of man.
Even within the organisation a new
step has been taken towards that uni-
versality which shouidbe the main
characteristic of Unesco : the Confer-
ence ! E, ! ! l ffect, charged the Direc-
tao-General to study the jJû' : L :  ! t ; cS
or à. 1 : itting as associate members a
certain number : T_'on-autonomous ter-
ritories.
It is impossible to review all aspects
of the programme decided upon for
1951 by the General Conference. It is
equally impossible to draw up a balance
sheet of endeavours which have already
borne fruit. Nevertheless, it must be
noted that the General Conference of
1950. marks an important date in the
struggle for the free circulation of
lùeas"by words and images". The
Conference has, in fact, unanimously
approved an International Convention
for the free circulation of educational
material. in lilt ; è ! ü  ! ! f gïêt ;-
ment, the signatory governments would
undertake to abolish customs duty on
hooks, publications and documents and
provide currency for the importation of
books to public libraries. Moreover, all
customs duties which have prevented
the importation of pictures, designs,
sculpture, music and material for mu-
seums, would also be lifted. Immediat-
ely after the approval of this project
agreed upon by the Conference, the
British delegation announced that its
government intended to sign and pre-
sent this document without delay for
the ratification of Parliament.
An Examination Of Conscience
W HETHEIl it was a question of exa-\\'mining its routine programme or
specially selected projects, the
General Conference was continually ab-
sorhed with the problem of peace. The
crises undergone and surmounted arose
from this"examination of conscience"
that the Conference had attempted, m
the words of M. Torres Bodet. Further-
more, one of the most significant fea-
tures of the Conference has been its
desire to place particular emphasis on
the role of the member states in the
execution of Unesco's programme.
L'nesco had at times been accused of
being a bureaucracy. This year even
the language of its programme indicates
an effort to nullify this objection. The
resolutions which have been voted are
not all drawn up according to the tra-
ditional formula :"The General Confer-
ence instructs the Director-GeneraL."
An increasing number begin with these
words :"The General Conference invites
member SMes..." One can perhaps land,
in this new trend, signs of a happy,
transformation. There is no cause for
astonishment that attention to such
matters is of such recent date. Unesco
is a young organism ; its means are
limited and its tasks immense. For live
years it has had to work as quic'kly
as possible ; to repair, with the means
at its disposal, the havoc of war ; to
draw up a programme and a field of
action.
Unesco, today, in taking stock of it-
self, is passing through a kind of crisis.
Its weakness, and at the same time its
strength is being noted."L'nesco", as
At. Torres Bodet has said,"consists o/
59 member states." : \leasured in terms
of this idea of an assembly of states,
the power of Unesco is immense. And
in order that this power can be fully
used, its programme and its efforts
must not be merely those of a team of
specialists ; they must become the com-
mon task of nations determined to safe-
guard peace.

Conference was to establish a long-range bc :. : ; i" programme for the
r. ext several years as distsyisned from the work plan for 1951.
Tr'UE, Unesco's ol : > !  : : :  ; ves for next year are part of a long-term plan,
cov : : ; y itle policies and main lines of work of the Organization.
InclUded in the basic programme is a 10 point list of tasks fo ;
Unesco. These are :
1. To eliminate illiteracy and encourage fundamental education :
2. To obtain for each person an education conforming to his aptitudes
and to the needs of society, including technological training and
higher education :
3. To promote respect for human rights throughout all nations :
4. To remove the obstacles to the free flow of persons, ideas and
knowledge between the countries of the world ;
5. To promote the progress and utilization of science for mankind :
6. To remove the causes of tensions that may lead to war ;
7. To demonstrate world cultural interdependence ;
8. To advance through the press, radio and motion pictures the cause
01 truth, freedom and peace ;
9. To bring about better understanding among the peoples of the
world and to convince them of the necessity of co-operating
loyally with one another in the framework of the United Nations :
10 To render clearing-house and exchange services in all its fields
of action, together with services in reconstruction and relief assis-
tance.
The basic programme resolutions are grouped under seven different
heads : Education, Natural Sciences, Social Sciences, Cultural Activities,
Exchange of Persons, Mass Communications and Relief Services. As lack
of space prevents publication of these resolutions in full, the Courier pre-
sents on this page a summarized version of the basic programme.
B E'l7ER ethds of education 8 : 
wider diffusion of o ; ;- ; : : ácy are
not. end_  ; 1 themselves. The
fiji object must be to equip man
lÁ> play his part harmoniously in the
modern world. It is not enough for
him to know his own land and his
own people ; he lives in a network of
relationships that go beyond frontiers.
Today, all nations are interdependent,
and they must learn to recognize it.
1. IMPROVEMENT OF EDUCATION
THROUGH THE EXCHANGE OF
INFORMATION
More progress can be achieved, and
; rakp .'a'1} J  ! t : :   ;."viû. tG.. if ine experi-
ments being made throughout the
world in education and psychology are
better known. Unesco collects inform-
ation about such experiments, ana-
lyses it, and promotes its distribution,
to help improve methods of teaching
and to further the international pur-
poses of Unesco.
2. EXTENSION OF EDUCATION
Unesco has the duty of helping
Member States to ensure for everybody
whose education has been neglected,
interrupted or impeded, the chance to
overcome his handicaps. Unesco must
pay special attention to fundamental
and adult education, and to the train-
ing-of handicapped children.
3. EDUCATION FOR INTERNATION-
AL UNDERSTANDING
Consciousness of the unity of man-
kind is still rudimentary. Teachers are
only beginning to discover suitable
methods ; textbooks need to be im-
proved. Schoolchildren know little
about the international organizations
of today and the services they can
render to world peace and prosperity.
Unesco must therefore help to promote
education In world citizenship.
The natural and exact sciences,
being objective and impartial,
of fer a particularly suitable field
for action by Unesco.
Laboratories and research institutes
influence the development of human
communities. All men should benefit
from discoveries that can raise stan-
dards of living. Once men are in a
position to improve their living condi-
tions, they are able as never before
to grow in mutual understanding.
1. DEVELOPMENT OF SCIENTIFIC
COOPERATION
Scientific research benefits from a
widespread exchange of information.
Unesco must help international orga-
nizations of scientists by encouraging
the meeting and movement of experts,
to help in the co-ordination of inter-
national scientific congresses, to pro-
mote the classification and analysis of
specialized publications and to over-
come difficulties of language by stan-
dardizing scientific terminology and by
encouraging multilingual dictionaries.
To ensure speedier exchanges between
scientists, Unesco maintains Scientific
cooperation offices in areas where thev
are most needed.
2. AS$ISTANCE Tn nSEARCH FOR
"t"UVEMENT OF THE LIV-
&.. ti CONDITIONS OF MANKIND.
Unesco can render genuine service
by detecting gaps in the development
of research and helping to fill them.
Thus, for example, it encourages insti-
tutes for the study of biological factors
in different climates or the develop-
ment of certain wide areas, and it par-
ticipates in the plans for creating
United Nations laboratories.
3. TEACHING AND POPULARIZ-
ATION OF SCIENCE
All men need access to basic scien-
tific knowledge in order that they hiity
better understand their world. They
should also know that such knowledge
depends in large measure on the result
of international cooperation. The ob-
ject should be to develop an attitude
of mind and an understanding of the
effects of applying science to modern
conditions and to the development of
human society.
No attempts to better the lot of
man can meet with success un-
less they take account of his en-
vironment. Unesco must there-
fore place social science in the fore-
ground of its field of study. Inter-
national cooperation is itself a pheno-
menon deserving scientific study.
The major international organiz-
ation established in the first half of
the twentieth century are especially
worth studying. In a world becoming
more complex, and more highly organ-
ized, the study of international coo-
peration may make it possible both to
improve that cooperation and to ex-
tend it to new fields.
1. AID TO INTERNATIONAL SCIEN-
TIFIC COOPERATION
There are three ways in which
Unesco can help in the teaching and
development of the social sciences.
These are by meetings which may re-
sult in new contacts and exchanges of
views, through translation and docu-
mentation services, and through the
standardization of technical termi-
nology.
2. STUDIES OF SOCIAL TENSIONS
International Cooperation must be
brought to bear on particular studies
related to the purposes of Unesco-
such as that of social tensions. Re-
search results must be disseminated
as widely as possible to prevent or
arrest the growth of mass mental atti-
tudes that endanger peace.
3. STUDIES OF INTERNATIONAL
COOPERATION
The organs of international cooper-
ation have sufficiently developed to
make a study of them by the methods
of Social Science worth while.
UNESCO'S first task is to foster
international relations by ar-
ranging for thinkers, writers,
artists and their ideas to move
freely across national frontiers. Unes-
cn forms a meeting ground for the
cultures of the world. It stimulates
nations to develop their literature, art
and science and see them as parts of
a world heritage. It helps Member
States to protect works of art from
neglect or violence and from the ra-
vages of time, and it assists in bring-
ing artists and writers before the world.
It uses every means to ensure that all
people shall have access to the best
works of every land and every age.
1. INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION
Gatherings of experts or of interna-
tional associations of scholars, can do
a great deal for cultural cooperation.
Unesco accordingly aids and encou-
rages such meetings, at the same time
associating these experts and associ-
ations with its own programme. The
exchange of specialized information de-
pends largely on documentary and
bibliographical services : here again
Unesco can do much useful work.
2, PROTECTION OF CREATIVE
WORK AND ITS AUTHORS
For the preservation of works of art
and historical monuments every State
is responsible both to its own people
and to mankind. But international co-
operation is also necessary to spread
wide the knowledge of method. Unesco
encourages and helps this activity,
offering technical assistance and, in
exceptional cases, where resources are
inadequate, aid in the raising of funds.
The creation of new  : : úsophical,
artistic or lite :  ; work, should be
foster,,"DY the assertion and defence
of the independence of the thinker,
writer and artist. Unesco seeks to
promote international cooperation in
order to ensure respect for this inde-
pendence throughout the world. Unes-
co is endeavouring to bring about the
conclusion of a universal convention
that will give equal consideration to
the interests of the authors, the in-
dustry, the workers and the general
public.
3. DISSEMINATION OF CULTURE
The Universal Declaration of Human
Rights affirms that"everyone has the
right freely to participate in the cultur-
al life of the community". Unesco will
assist Member States by providing in-
formation, carrying out studies, mak-
ing recommendations and, where ne-
cessary, itself taking practical action to
direct the education of both youth and
adults towards a better understanding
of the culture of mankind. Finally,
means should be found for improving
the quality of the reproduction and
translation of artistic and literary
works and for their wide dissemin-
ation.
STUDY abroad not only gives in-
sight into new discoveries and
techniques but also helps the i -
habitants of one country to adapt
themselves to the ways of life and
thought of another. Accordingly,
Unesco encourages people with differ-
ent national, social and cultural back-
grounds to visit other countries either
for general education or for profess-
ional training.
The world today suffers from a
shortage of experts and technicians in
almost every field of activity. Unesco
is accordingly doing its best to multi-
ply fellowships as well as facilities for
short periods of study. It is itself able
to award annually a limited number
of fellowships.
1. CLEARING-HOUSE
The Clearing-House makes inform-
ation available to Member States, go-
vernmental and other organizations,
institutions and persons concerned
with education in order to advise those
wishing to study abroad, to ensure a
closer co-ordination of already existing
activities, and to stimulate new pro-
grammes. In the publication of the
volume"Study Abroad"a methodical
attempt is made to list all facilities for
study abroad available to students :
2. PROMOTION
To encourage interr. ational exchange
of persons, Unesco seeks to increase
facilities for those requiring financial
assistance and to promote broader and
more varied programmes. It also sug-
gests how programmes of study abroad
can serve the cause of international
understanding.
3. FELLOWSHIP ADMINISTRATION
The award of fellowships enabling
qualified candidates to study abroad
helps Unesco to implement its own
programme, inasmuch as holders of
travel fellowship financed by Unesco
can be associated with its projects and
activities. Unesco can also give help
and advice to institutions planning
international fellowship programmes
and it furthermore organizes interne-
ships for students
TRESS, radio and film can do much
to help international understand-
ing. Understanding depends on
information, and in a free world
the right to this is part of the right to
education.
Unesco's first task is to make a sur-
vey of the present resources for mass
communications, as the basis for im-
prOVIng them. Unequal technical de-
velopment in various countries has
often led to such disparities that what
should be normal for all is often
in fact the privilege of the few.
Unesco is therefore building up a
clearing-house for the exchange of
data on public information systems so
that all may benefit from one an-
other's experience. Unesco must also
encourage the scientific study of the
problems of mass communication and
promote professional training to meet
modern needs. Nor do knowledge or
training solve all the problems, so long
as ideas and technical materials can-
not freely cross national frontiers.
Unesco in its survey of present resour-
ces also collects data about such obsta-
cles to a free flow, and sePU o sur-
mount them by International agree-
ments or íl otlier ways.
according to its Constitution, Unesco
collaborates"in the work of advancing
mutual knowledge and understanding
of peoples through all means of mass
communication". Throughout the
world, consequently, it stimulates the
uses of press, film, radio and related
media to promote social progress and
international understanding and uses
them to enlighten the public about its
activities and objectives.
1. IMPROVEMENT OF MEANS AND
TECHNIQUES OF INFORMAT10N
Unesco has set up an information
clearing-house to deal with all pro-
blems concerning mass communic-
ations, including professional an\
technical training and the techniques
and influence of the press, radio and
aim. Exact information is collected
by field surveys.
2, REDUCTION OF OBSTACLES TO
THE FREE FLOW OF INFORM-
ATION
Progress in the field of mass com-
munication requires the reduction and,
if possible, the removal of certain ob-
stacles. Means of overcoming them
must be investigated and adequate
measures recommended to Member
States, to whom appropriate inter-
national conventions must be submitted
for ratification. The free flow, which
Unesco thus seeks to promote, should
cover not only ideas and news of an
informative nature but all audio-visual
material serving educational, scientific
and cultural purposes.
3. ACTION THROUGH PRESS, FILM
AND RADIO
While encouraging, within the scope
of its capacities and the limits of its
programme, the practical activities of
the press, cinema and radio. Unesco
intends also to employ the facilities
they offer for the purposes laid down
in its Constitution. It encourages di-
rectors and producers through dis-
cussion and the supply of material, to
take due account of the services to be
rendered to international understand-
ing in the fields of education, science
and culture. It also keeps them in-
formed of its own activities and sup-
plies them with appropriate material
ready for immediate use.
ALL those things we hold valuable
in education, science and culture
are from time to time thre tened
by disaster-whether natural or
at the hands of man. Help for the
victims of such misfortunes, if it is to
be really effective, must be co-ordinat-
ed and directed where it is most
needed. Unesco has undertaken, with-
in the sphere of its competence, to
collect, analyse and distribute inform-
ation about the nature and extent of
the help required.
This documentary service provides
a basis for three types of action : first-
ly, Unesco gives direct aid to devastat-
ed countries by gifts of material or by
the provision of services, drawing for
this purpose on a Relief Fund to which
it contributes from its own budget.
This direct aid is supplemented by
campaigns for voluntary aid in which
Unesco unites its efforts with those of
other organizations pursuing similar
aims. These campaigns are capable
of producing substantial results.
Lastly, Unesco encourages voluntary
work camps conducted in accordance
with the aims of Unesco and engaged
in reconstruction tasks to become
centres of international understanding.

EDUCATION

### 81485: UNESCO's programme for 1951

UNESCO during 1951 will stimulateshe movement for mass educa-
tion in many parts of the world
chiefly by helpinq member states
to develop and improve their work in
such fields as fundamental and adult
education. Unesco will therefore pre-
pare teaching materials, organize se-
minars and educational conferences,
help to train teachers at regional cen-
tres and develop educational co-opera-
tion through missions and the exchan-
ge of information.
Three educational missions will be
sent to member states and inquiries
into language and science teaching
will be continued with the Internatio-
nal Bureau of Education. The probiem
of expanding and lengthening free
education and the effect of this on
labour and industry will be discussed
with the International Bureau of Edu-
cation and the International Labour
Office.
Unesco will give advice and provide
technical facilities for the United Na-
tions Technical Assistance Program-
me. The pilot project, started in Hai-
ti between 1948 and 1950, will be
further developed. The Government
of India plans a pi10t project in as-
sociation with Unesco. A seminar on
fundamental and adult education is
planned for the Near East.
Unesco will continue a comparative
study of curricula in use in the va-
rious countries of the world in the
teaching of history, geography and so-
cial studies. It will issue a publica-
tion on the teaching of history and
a Teacher's Guide to the Declaration
of Human Rights. Studies on history
and geography textbooks used in va-
rious countries will be continued, and
an international seminar on the
teaching of history in primary and
secondary schools will be held.
To meet a request from the United
Nations and its specialized agencies,
Unesco will investigate measures to
reduce illiteracy, to use native langua-
ges in teaching, and to stimulate in-
ternational action to break down bar-
riers to the access of women to edu-
cation.
Special efforts will be made to de-
termine and encourage the application
of the most effective ways of teaching
children about the Universal Decla-
ration of Human Rights and about the
United Nations and its Specialized
Agencies.
NATURAL SCIENCES
THE 1951 activities of Unesco inthe field of Natural Sciences will
particularly concern the develop-
ment of international scientific co-
operation, assistance to research for
the improvement of the living con-
ditions of mankind, and the teaching
and popularization of science.
Approval has been given to study a
plan to set up regional research cen-
tres, with funds to be obtained out-
side Unesco's budget. One example
suggested was for a centre of research
in physics and other sciences in
ON this and the following page, the Courier presents a sum-mary of the main Unesco projects for 1951 approved by
the Fifth Session of the General Conference. From this
programme, M. Jaime Torres Bodet, Unesco's Director-General
has been authorized to select immediate priority projects so as
to carry out Unesco's work in the most effective and concen-
trated manner.
The Unesco work plans for 1951 have been allocated a budget
of $8, 200, 000, but in addition to the regular annual budget, finan-
cial resources may be increased through voluntary contributions
from member countries. These extra funds would be used to
finance special projects outside the ordinary programme, which
are to be worked out by the Director-General and the Executive
Board.
Western Europe as an attempt to over-
come difficulties arising out of the
high cost of research into higher phy-
sics.
Grants-in-aid and services will be
given to international organizations in
the fields of engineering, science, me-
dicine, agriculture, biology and the
protection of nature. Discussions will
be promoted on scientific problems of
regional importance ; and action taken
to organize the exchange of scientific
information, personnel and material.
Recognizing the value of Unesco's
Field Science Co-operation Offices, the
Conference voted to increase the bud-
get allotted to them. These offices
will help the execution of the Plan of
Technical Assistance to under-deve-
loped areas.
Unesco will also make a special ef-
fort to encourage scientific and tech-
nical research and development of arid
and semi-arid areas, in co-operation
with the International Arid Zone
Research Council and with the United
Nations.
Unesco also aims to bring science
into the lives of ordinary men and
women by fostering science clubs,
scientific exhibitions, discussions
among workers'groups about the ef-
fect on their work of scientific pro-
gress, and world-wide discussions on
themes related to the inter-action bet-
ween Science and Society. The Orga-
nization will help publishers to pro-
duce cheap attractive books on science,
and will distribute popular scientific
articles to newspapers and magazines,
and filmstrips for use by lecturers to
non-scientific groups. It will help as-
sociations for the advancement of
science in war-devastated and other
needy areas.
Finally, Unesco will promote closer
international collaboration between
science teachers, particularly in science
teaching methods and the develop-
ment of a scientific attitude in pri-
mary and secondary schools.
SOCIAL SCIENCES
UNESCO'S Social Sciences program-
me has three main sections : aid
to international scientific colla-
boration, studies of social tensions,
and studies of international co-oper-
ation.
The studies of social tensions will
include an investigation of race con-
tacts in Brazil, to determine factors
contributing to harmonious race rela-
tions.
Unesco plans a study of population
problems in countries in process of in-
dustrialization, win organize a study
of tensions resulting from over-popu-
lation, and will continue the enquiry
into tensions resulting from shifts of
population. Unesco will also arrange
a"tensions"investigation among Ja-
panese youth.
Unesco will encourage the develop-
ment of international associations in
the branches of sociology, political
science, economics, comparative law,
and international studies, and will
entrust them with work correlated to
its programme. It will publish a perio-
dical for social scientists and will en-
courage the development of social
sciences'documentation services.
Studies will be made in the field of
international co-operation. In one of
these Unesco will seek to determine
how greater public support can be ob-
tained for the United Nations.
Finally, Unesco will study the tech-
nique of international conferences
based upon exploratory surveys car-
ried out during 1949-50, and will pu-
hlish the'results.
CULTURAL ACTIVITIES
WITH the aid of the Internatio-nal Council of Philosophy and
Humanistic Studies, UNESCO
will assist studies already in progress
on the native cultures of America,
Africa and other regions. Another
plan to be carried out is the pre-
paration by an international group
of experts of a history of the scien-
tific and cultural development of hu-
manity, showing the exchanges which
have taken place throughout the ages
between different peoples and cultures
in science, technology, philosophy, the
arts and other branches of cultural
life.
In addition to assisting the develop-
ment of modern cultural relations,
UNESCO helps to preserve the cultu-
ral heritage of the past through the
maintenance of libraries and museums
containing Books and works of art
which constitute this heritage. The
rights and the material and moral in-
terests of the authors of literary and
artistic creation must be defended.
UNESCO will also endeavour to bring
the most important works and expres-
sions of world culture to all peoples.
UNESCO will continue its efforts to
co-ordinate fiiò1iographical services on
an international basis. Furthermore,
it will study the problem of the mi-
crophotographic reproduction of rare
periodicals anõ the practical aid to be
given to certain States for the repro-
duction of important documents.
In the field of the visual arts,
UNESCO will conduct an enquiry on
the place held by the arts in the edu-
cational system of various countries.
In order to famiIiarise the masses
with art, impulse will be given to the
photographic reproduction of the
works of art of all countries.
Under the auspices of the Interna-
tional Council of Music, international
music festivals will be held, scholar-
ships and grants awarded, and music-
al scores of special importance co-
pied, reproduced, and lent from one
country to another. The work of ca-
taloguing recorded music will be con-
tinued, and UNESCO will increase it
by a collection of important musical
works which have not yet been record-
ed on a commercial scale. It will
also encourage the recording of folk
music.
UNESCO will continue to collabo-
rate with the International P. E. N.
Club. It will also publish information
on the translations of foreign books
published in each country and in the
Index translationum, an international
analytic catalogue of translations.
The translation of the chief literary
and cultural works of every country
into the greatest possible number of
languages will be chiefly concerned, in
1951, with Italian, Arabic and Latin-
American literature.
UNESCO will also work for the esta-
blishment of a Universal Copyright
Convention, and will prepare the con-
vening of an inter-governmental con-
ference to decide on the text of this
convention.
EXCHANGE
OF PERSONS
UNESCO will continued an enquiryinto means of removing obsta-
cles to the free movement of
persons. A new edition of a spe-
cial supplement to"Study Abroad"on
study opportunities during vacations
will be published. The basic work,
"Study Abroad", of which successive
editions were published in 1948, 1949
and 1950 constitutes a general guide to
existing openings of study abroad. In-
tended originally to provide a fun list
of international fellowships, the con-
tents have been progressively augment-
ed to include other categories of ex-
changes as, for example, industrial
and agricultural workers, and young
people.

mental organizations on the granting
and administering of international
study grants, and making this infor-
mation available to individuals, groups
and governments, UNESCO will also
help to bring about adoption of com-
mon methods and techniques in the
administration of scholarships and
the planning of new programmes.
As budgetary limitations prevent
UNESCO from allocating large sums
for the creation and administration of
scholarships, the programme for 1951
aims to encourage exchanges of per-
sons by co-ordinating activities of or-
ganizations which award fellowships
and study grants.
Help to intellectual refugees is cov-
ered by an International Student Ser-
vice proposal sponsored by the Ne-
therlands Conference delegation, pro-
viding for the creation-with UNESCO
help-of a fund for the use of refugee
students.
UNESCO will itself during 1951
grant 55 fellowships for citizens of its
Member States. These will allow spe-
cialists to study activities related to
the UNESCO Programme. After the
beneficiaries have finished their work
and returned to their home countries,
UNESCO remains in close contact with
them so that the knowledge they have
acquired may be used in the applica-
tion of UNESCO's programme.
MASS
COMMUNICATIONS
To bering about the widest possiblepublic participation in its pro-
gramme and an understanding
of its aims by action through the
world's press, radio, films and other
media of communications will be one
of the main Unesco tasks for 1951.
REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE FAR EAST THE MIDDLE EAST, LATIN AME.
RICA AND EUROPE AT UNESCO'S FIFTH GENERAL CONFERENCE
The aim will be to present these
activities so as to focus them upon the
Universal Declaration of Human
Rights and within this framework, to
highlight the right to education, the
benefits of scientific progress and in-
formation. Emphasis will be put on
material illustrating : Fundamental
education for all people and education
for international understanding ; the
right of all peoples to enjoy the bene-
fits of scientific progress and the rela-
tionship of the work of scientists to
peace and human welfare ; the strug-
gle to resolve racial and other pro-
blems, and the methods and achieve-
ments oi international co-operation ;
the part played by creative artists in
such co-operation ; freedom of infor-
mation and the free exchange of ideas.
The organization will examine the
possibility of creating an Internatio-
nal Institute of the Press and Infor-
mation through consultations with
national and international organiza-
tions.
The replies from these groups will
be discussed by an experts'committee
set up by Unesco. On the basis of the
replies, Unesco will be able to decide
whether a conference to create the
Institute should be called.
The General Conference also ap-
proved a number of projects to helpUnesco's efforts to reduce obstacles to
the free flow of information. One of
them is to secure from the contracting
parties of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade further reductions
of customs barriers to the internatio-
nai circulation of educational, scienti-
fic and cultural materials.
Unesco will also co-operate with the
Regional Economic Commissions of
the United Nations in the encourage-
ment of the domestic production, the
promotion of the exchange, and the
facilitation of trade agreements in-
volving educational, scientific and cul-
tural materials. It will seek, in con-
junction with these commissions, spe-
cial dispensations for categories of
persons engaged in educational activi-
ties with regard to visa and frontier
formalities, labour permits and simi-
lar facilities. Unesco will work for
wider application of schemes initiated
by the Universal Postal Union to per-
mit payment in national currencies
for subscriptions to foreign newspa-
pers, and for a 50 per cent reduction
on postal charges for printed matter.
The preparation and dissemination
of a study such as"World Press Co-
verage of Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Information"will also be un-
dertaken.
An international agreement reduc-
ing or abolishing economic controls on
the movement of books, newspapers,
works of art, documentary films and a
wide range of other educational mate-
rials, was adopted by the Conference *
During 1951, Unesco will also carry
out intensive work as a clearing
house for the collection, analysis, diss-
emination and exchange of informa-
tion and experiences in the techniques,
uses and effects of the press, film, ra-
dio and allied media in the fields of
education, science and culture.
Expert aid missions will be underta-
ken to advise and assist in the im-
provement of mass communications in
under-developed or war devastated
countries.
The world survey of technical faci-
lities, already carried out in 52 coun-
tries or territories, will be completed
and extended to 33 other countries
and territories. The Member States
will be invited to set up within the
framework of their National Commis-
sions standing consultative commit-
tees on technical and professionnal
problems.
Finally, Unesco will continue its ef-
fort to bring about world unification
in Braille. A world Braille Council
will be created and conferences will be
held for experts in Arabic and Spa-
nish-Portuguese Braille.
. See page 7 of this issue for a
report on this agreement.
RELIEF SERVICES
THE Relief Assistance Service ofUNESCO, set up five years ago
as the Reconstruction Depart-
ment to help war-hit countries, has
now extended its programme to meet
the needs of any country requiring
relief.
War damage is being repaired, but
new emergency situations requiring
the assistance of an international or-
ganization such as UNESCO still arise.
The wars in Palestine and Greece left
many refugees to be cared for as did
the earthquakes in Ecuador last year
and in Peru this year, when numerous
schools and buildings of great histo-
ric and artistic value were destroyed
The General Conference considered
two such problems in particular : tñe
situation of refugee children in Greece
and the Near East, which continues to
be extremely serious. As no really ef-
fective help could be given from
Unesco's limited budget, the Confe-
rence decided to appeal to the govern-
ments of the 59 Member States to
contribute funds sufficient for effec-
tive action.
Unesco's Relief Service will continue
to assemble information on the needs
of countries and use it to prepare for
the provision of direct assistance or
the organization of voluntary aid cam-
paigns. It will also allocate credits
from the Relief Fund to needy coun-
tries and will assist them to purchase
and transport equipment and help to
secure import and export licences and
customs exemptions.
As UNESCO's funds are insufficient
for this work, the Service will work
with Member States to focus public
opinion and sympathy en the needs of
devastated areas and organist cam-
paigns for voluntary assistance. Fi-
nally, it will aid co-ordination inter-
nationally-and, through National
Commissions, nationally-of the ef-
forts of the voluntary associations
participating in UNESCO's relief work.

### 81488: General Conference adopts world agreement for duty-free import of educational materials 

GENERAL CONFERENCE ADOPTS V1/ORLD AGREEMENT
FOR DUTY-FREE IMPORT OF EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS
IN some countries books comingfrom abroad are taxed as uch
as 300 per cent. Scientific equip-
ment needed in research laboratories,
! is taxed with equal severity. Education
exhibitions, destined for schools and
museums, remain in customs'ware-
houses while their sponsors try to raise
the heavy bond often required by the
authorities.
These tariff and trade regulations
make it costly, difficult and sometimes
impossible for people in many coun-
tries to obtain the works of art, and
the scientific and educational materials
they need.
To remedy that situation, Unesco's
Fifth General Conference adopted
unanimously a new international
Agreement allowing a wide range of
educational, scientific and cultural ma-
terials to move across frontiers free of
duty. Governments adhering to this
Agreement will abolish duties on books,
newspapers, magazines, musical scores,
maps and charts. They will grant
import licences and foreign currency
for publications needed by public
libraries.
The Agreement will also permit the
free importation of paintings, drawings
and sculpture. Approved institutions,
such as museums, laboratories and
schools, will enjoy sweeping privileges
for the free importation of everything
from documentary films to scientific
apparatus. One provision, for exam-
pie, eliminates barriers to the move-
ment of everything required for the
educational advancement of the blind.
"Free Trade"
in Culture
'\T'3W that the Agreement has beenunanimously adopted, it will be
opened shortly for signature at
Lake Success. The British Govern-
ment has announced that it will sign
the Agreement and submit it to Par-
liament for ratification. Many other
countries have also indicated that they
will seek quick legislative approval of
the pact. There is little doubt that it
will obtain, within a short delay, the
ten ratifications needed to bring it
into force.
This is the second international
Agreement to be sponsored by Unesco.
The first is designed to abolish duties,
quotas and other trade barriers to the
movement of films, recordings and
similar audio-visual aids to education.
It has been signed by 17 countries
and ratified by one, Norway.
When these Unesco Agreements
enter into force, bringing a"free
trade"in culture, people in each coun-
try will find it much easier to obtain
books, paintings, documentary films
and all types of educational materials
from other countries-a significant,
practical step towards international
understanding.

### 81490: The Scientific basis for human unity: UNESCO publishes Declaration by world's scientists

THE SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR HUMAN UNITS
Unesco Publishes Declaration By World's Scientists
The following statement was published by Unesco on July y) 8 th.) t was prepared by the Unesco Committee
of Experts on Race Problems, at Unesco House in Paris, and was drafted by the following scientists : Ernest Beagle-
hole, New Zealand ; Juan Comas, Mexico ; L. A. Costa Pinto, Brazil ; Franklin Frazier, United States ; Morris
Ginsberg, United Kingdom ; Humayun Kabir, India ; Claude Levi-Strauss, France ; Ashley Montage, United
States. The text was revises. by Professor Montagu after criticisms submitted by Professors Hadley Cantril, E. G. Conklin,
Gunnar Dahlberg, Theodosius Dobzhansky, L. C. Dunn, Donald Hager, Julian S. Hux ! ey. Otto Klineberg, Wi ! bert Moore.
H. J. Muller, Gunnar Myrdal, and Joseph Needham.
SCIENTISTS have reached general
agreement in recognising that
mankind is one : that all men belong
to the same species, Homo sapiens.
It is further generally agreed among
scientists that all men are probably
derived from the same common stock ;
and that such differences as exist between
different groups of mankind are due to
the operation of evolutionary factors of
differentiation such as isolation, the drift
and random fixation of the material
particles which control heredity (the
genes), changes in the structure of the : e
particles, hybridization, and natural
selection. In these ways groups have
arisen of varying stability and degree of
differentiation which have been classified
in different ways for different purposes.
From the biological standpoint, the
species Homo sapiens is made up of a
number of populations, each one of which
differs from the others in the frequency
of one or more genes. Such genes,
responsible for the hereditary differences
between men, are aiways few when com-
pared to the whole genetic constitution
of man and to the vast number of genes
common to all human beings regardless
choose to describe as a race. Thus, many
national, religious, geographic, linguistic
or cultural groups have, in such loose
usage, been called"races", when obviously
Americans are not a race, nor are En-
glishmen, nor Frenchmen, nor any other
national group. Catholics, Protestants,
Moslems, and Jews are not races, nor are
groups who speak English or any other
language thereby definable as a race ;
people who live in Iceland or England or
India are not races ; nor are people who
are culturally Turkish or Chinese or the
like thereby describable as races.
National, religious, geographic, lin-
guistic. and cultural groups do not ne-
cessarily coincide with racial groups ; and
the cultural traits of such groups have
no demonstrated genetic connection with
racial traits. Because serious errors of
this kind are habitually committed when
the term"race"is used in popular par-
lance. it would be better when speaking
of human races to drop the term"race"
altogether and speak of ethnic groups.
Now what has the scientist to say
about the groups of mankind which may
be recognized at the present time ? Hu-
man races can be and have been dif-
RACIAL HARMONY-NEW ZEALAND In New Zealand the Maori population morethan doubled between 1896 and 1936 and
today Maoris number about one twentieth 01 the total population. Not more than half of
the Maoris are 01 pure Maori descent and the number 01 those of mixed blood appears to
be increasing rather more rapidly than those of unmixed race. Maoris made an important
contribution to New Zealand's war effort and to-day are participating more and more in
the economic and political life of the country, one important development being the increas-
ing number entering the teaching profession.
of the population to which they belong.
This means that the likenesses among
men are far greater than their diffe-
rences.
A race, from the biological standpoint,
may therefore be defined as one of the
group of populations constituting the
species"Homo sapiens."These popul-
ations are capable of interbreeding with
one another but, by virtue of the isolat-
ing barriers which in the past kept them
more or less separated, exhibit certain
physical differences as a result of their
somewhat different biological histories.
They represent variations, as it were, on
a common theme.
In short, the term"race"designates a
group or population characterised by
some concentrations, relative as to fre-
quency and distribution, of hereditary
particles (genes) or physical characters,
which appear, fluctuate, and often disap-
pear in the course of time by reason of
geographic and/or cultural isolation. The
varying manifestations of these traits in
different populations are perceived in
different ways by each group. What is
perceived is largely preconceived, so that
ea h group arbitrarily tends to misinter-
pret the variability which occurs as a
fundamental difference which separates
tr> ! t g-roup from all others.
These are the scientific facts. Unfor-
tunately, however, when most people use
the term"race"they do not do. so in the
tense above defined. To most people, a
race is any group of people whom they
ferently classified by different anthropo-
logists, but at the present time most
anthropologists agree in classifying the
greater part of present-day mankind into
three major divisions, as follows :
i\longoloid, Negroid, Caucasoid
The biological processes which the clas-
sifier has here embalmed, as it were, are
dynamic, not static. These divisions
were not the same in the past as they
are at present, and there is every reason
to believe that they will change in the
future.
Many sub-groups or ethnic groups
within these divisions have been deserio-
ed. There is no general agreement upon
tneir number, and in any event most
ethnic groups have not yet been either
studied or described by the physical
anthropologist.
Whatever classification the anthro-
pologist makes of man, he never includes
mental characteristics as part of those
classifications. It is now generally reco-
gnized that intelligence tests do nof in
themselves enable us to differentiate
tafely between what is due to innate
capacity and what is the result of envi-
ronmental influences, training and educ-
ation. Wherever it has been possible
to make allowances for differences in
environmental opportunities, the tests
have shown essential similarity in men-
tal characters among all human groups.
In short, given similar degrees of cul-
tural opportunity to realise their poten-
tialities, the aVel'aj ; e achic\'ement,) f
the members of each ethnic group is
about the same. The scientific investig-
ations of recent years fully support the
dictum of Confucius (551-478 B. C.)"Men's
natures are alike ; it is their habits that
carry them far apart".
The scientific material available to us
at present does not justify the conclusion
that inherited genetic differences are a
major factor in producing the differences
between the cultures and cultural
achievements of different peoples or
groups. It does indicate, however, that
the history of the cultural experience
which each group has undergone is the
major facter in explaining such differ-
ence. The one trait which above all
others has been at a premium in the
evolution of men's mental characters has
been educability, plasticity. This is a
trait which all human beings possess. It
is, ind'ed, a species character of"Homo
sapiens."
So far as temperament is concerned,
there is no definite evidence that there
exist inborn differences between human
groups. There is evidence that whatever
group differences of the kind there might
be are greatly over-ridden by the indi-
vidual differences, and by the differences
springing from environmental factors.
As fer personality and character, these
may be considered raceless. In every
human group a rich variety of personality
and character types will be found, and
there is no reason fer believing that any
human group is richer than any other in
these respects.
Biological Facts and Racial Myths
WITH respect to race-mixture, theevidence points unequivocally to
the fact that this has been going
on from the earliest times. Indeed, one
of the chief processes of race-formation
and race-extinction or absorption is by
means of hybridization between races or
ethnic groups. Furthermore, no con-
vincing evidence has been adduced that
race-mixture ef itself produces biolo-
gically bad effects. Statements that hu-
man hybrids frequently show undesirable
traits, both physically and mentally, phy-
sical disharmonies and mental dege-
neracies, are not supported by the facts.
There is, therefore, no biological justi-
fication for prohibiting intermarriage
between persons of different ethnic
groups.
The biological fact of race and the
myth of"race"should be distinguished.
For all practical social purposes"race"
is not so much a biological phenomenon
as a social myth. The myth of"race"
has created an enormous amount of
human and social damage. In recent
years it has taken a heavy toll in human
lives and caused untold suffering. It
still prevents the normal development of
millions of human beings and deprives
civilization of the effective co-operation of
productive minds.
The biological differences between
ethnic groups should be disregarded from
the standpoint of social acceptance and
sccial action. The unity of mankind
from both the biological and social
viewpoints is the main thing.
To recognize this and to act accordingly
is the first requirement of modern man.
It is but to recognize what a great
biologist wrote in 1875 :"As man advances
in civilization, and small tribes are united
into larger communities, the simplest
reason would tell each individual that he
ought to extend his social iilstincts and
sympathies to all the members of thesa e nation, though personally unknown
to him. This point being once reached,
there is only an artificial barrier toprevent his sympathies extending to the
men of all nations and races."
These are the words of Charles Darwin
in"The Descent of Man" (2nd ed., 1875,
pp. 187-188). And, indeed, the whole of
human history shows that a co-operative
spirit is not only natural to men, but
more deeply rooted than any self-seeking
tendencies. If this were not so we should
not see the growth of integration and
organization of his communities which
the centuries and the millennia plainly
exhibit.
We now have to consider the bearing
ef these statements on the problem of
human equality. It must be asserted
with the utmost emphasis that equality
as an ethical principle in no way depends
upon the assertion that human beings
are in fact equal in endowment. Obvious-
ly individuals in all ethnic groups vary
greatly among themselves in endowment.
Nevertheless the characteristics in which
human groups differ from one another
are often exaggerated and used as a basis
for questioning the validity of equality in
the ethical sense. For this purpose we
have thought it worth while to set out in
a formal manner what is at present
scientifically established concerning indiv-
idual and group differences.
(The fmal conclusicns of the scienUsts

### 81491: Race and civilization

RACE AI
TOWARDS the end of the last century,
a French anthropologist. Lapouge,
declared t at the day was drawing
near when men would slaughter
one another for a few millimetres'differ-
ence in cranium size. What may then
have seemed only a whimsical theory has
since become harsh reality with the per-
petration of appalling massacres during
the last decade in the name of racial
superiority. Thus our age has been given
the sorry privilege of verifying prophe-
cies, which not long ago would have been
regarded as ludicrous.
Unfortunately the evils of racial
discrimination have not disappeared with
the suppression of Nazi political power.
Although not applied in such ruthless
fashion it still causes immeasurable
suffering every day and continues to
affect the lives and futures of millions of
people.
Racism is one of the most disturbing
phenomena of the great revolution of the
modern world. At the very time when
industrial civilization is penetrating to all
points of the globe and is uprooting men
of every colour from their age-old tradi-
tions, a doctrine, treacherously scientific
in appearance, is invoked in order to rob
these men of their full share in the
advantages of the civilization forced upon
them.
There exists in the structure of Western
civilization a fatal contradiction. On the
one hand it wishes and insists that cer-
tain cultural values, to which it attributes
the highest virtues, be assimilated by
other people. But, conversely, it will not
admit that two-thirds of humanity is
capable of attaining this standard which
it has set up. Ironically, the worst
sufferers from racial dogma are usually
the people whose intellect most forcibly
demonstrates its falseness.
No"Pure"Races
FOR nearly a century, all genuinej'anthropologists have insisted o  th
purely conventional character of the
features chosen to classify the human

species. They have reiterated that there
is no such thing as a pure race, that
racial differences are biological and pro-
bably do not affect character and mental
faculties, and that from the anthropolo-
gical point of view the human species is
one. But little attention has been paid
by the majority to their words.
How many cultivated, intelligent and
kindly people believe in all good faith
that Negroes inherit at birth an exu-
berant and primitive nature and that
rhythm and dance are theirs from the
cradle ? How many others, who believe
themselves to be free from any taint of
racial prejudice, credit the Jews with
intellectual qualities superior to those of
Chistians ? Every day, all too many
attest to the belief that racial groups
have hereditary virtues and defects, a
belief which is a commonly accepted
error, and which, if not discredited, comes
to be accepted as the truth.
Race prejudice thrives on the inability
of most people to make a clear distinction
between facts pertaining to civilization
and culture on the one hand and biolo-
gical facts on the other. Men are dis.
tinguished by their respective cultures,
which is that"complex whole which
includes knowledge, belief, art, morals,
law, custom, and any other capabilities
and habits acquired by man as a member
of society."As cultural differences are
frequently associated with. physical
differences, the latter have been regarded
too often as the cause of the former.
Culture Confused With Instinct
SOCIAL prejudice will not diminishuntil it is generally rec8gnized that
the real differences between human
societies are not due to biological here-
dity but to cultural environment. The
influence of culture on the individual is
at once so subtle ant strong, and it is
exerted from such an early age, that it is
apt to be confused with instinct.
The cultural factor plays a highly
important part in the workings of the
intellect. A poor. isolated group which
does not receive much stimulus from the
outside world may easpy be taken to be
congenitally inferior ; but another one in
the favourable atmosphere of a different
moral and economic environment, may be
regarded as a privileged specimen of
mankind.
Psychology and criminology have
taught us that delinquency is related to
social conditions. If we are convinced of
the importance of family and social
environment, why should we refuse to
recognize the part played by culture ? It
is too easily forgotten that there are
many cultural specializations and many
choices open to every culture.
Take for example the Australian abori-
gines. Their tools and economy are
those of our prehistoric ancestors. Like
several species of fauna in the country
they seem to represent an early stage of
evolution. Nevertheless, these primitive
people have developed a social organiz-
ation and a system of relationship of
such complexity and refinement that it
requires an able brain and a degree of
mathematical ability to unravel all its
intricacies. In comparison, some of our
systems are simple, even crude. Examples
from other sccieties could be multiplied.
Doubts About The Nordics
ONE of the essential features of culturesis their malleability. They change
rather rapidly and only remain static
in certain exceptional cases.
The racial composition of Europe has
probably varied very little in the course
of the last two or three thousand years,
but would anyone venture to affirm that
European mentality has always been the
same ? Would Englishmen of today
feel at home among the subjects of
Edward IlL ? In Japan the 19th century
saw the tremendous cultural revolution of
a people whose racial type was in no way
changed, for it is obvious that, biologic-
ally speaking, the Japanese of 1950 is
the same as his great-grandfather in the
days of Commodore Perry.
The United States of America provide
a very good example of the fact that
culture is more important than race.
Who has not been impressed by the
"typically American"mentality, gestures
and behaviour of persons springing from
the most varied races ?
It is a gross error to believe history
can be explained by race. Western
industrial culture does not owe its great
development and power to any innate
superiority of the white race. The Gauls,
as Julius Caesar describes them, were
scarcely superior to Western African
tribes, whom some people glibly declare
incapable of progress. Writers of the
ancient Mediterranean peoples frequently
expressed doubts about the capacities of
the Nordics, some of whom are inclined
today to disdain other races.
There is nothing hereditary or even
spontaneous in the antipathy felt by
members of one racial group for those of
another. Observations on the behaviour
of children show very clearly that they
express aversion for people of another
colour only under the influence of the
family milieu. The millions of half-
castes in the world are witness that
different races have in fact a particular
attraction for one another. Relations
between races are generally determined
by cultural tradition. History is there to
teach us that this tradition-has varied
greatly in the course of the centuries.
No Escape From Heredity
RACISM is a relatively new myth,dating back to only two or three
centuries ago. Before the colonial
expansion of the European powers, men
despised or hated one another for cultural
or religious differences, but did not claim
to be superior to one another because of
the colour of their skin or the shape of
their skull or their nose.
Morally, slavery was just as damaging
to the whites as to the blacks. The
whites made skin colour and other phy-
sical characteristics indelible distinguish-
ing marks. The Inquisition burnt the
Jews because they had crucified Christ
and because they were supposed to be the
enemies of the faith ; the Nazis did the
same because the Jews were said to belong
to a species which was inherently harm-
ful. The difference is of little importance
to the victim, but it means much from

the point of view of history. It is pos-
sible to change one's religious convictions ;
but nobody can escape heredity.
There is in this concept of race some-
thing implacable. The barbarity of our
time is more ruthless and more absurd
than that of the so-called Dark Ages ; for
racial prejudice is an un-intelligent and
unattractive myth. Its fiourishing deve-
lopment in the twentieth century will no
doubt in future ages be regarded as one
of the most shameful episodes in history.
Science versus Prejudice

rational dogma. To show up these
errors and lessen their harmful effect, we
must use the means supplied by science,
culture and education. Unesco. better

Any campaign for an ideological object-

principles. As regards race, what is
needed is not dogma or moral conviction.
but scientific data, in view of the fact
that the system of race discrimination
claims to derive from actual experience
and alleged biological laws. Before
making an appeal to common sense, to
charity, and even to the self-interest of
the groups affected by this plague, it was
necessary to ascertain the results of
scientific observation.
That is why a commission of anthro-
pologists and sociologists met towards
the end of last year at Unesco House for
the purpose of preparing a document in
which the attitude of science to the
racial problem would be clearly set forth.
This declaration, reproduced elsewhere.
leaves not a shadow of doubt, that the
specialists look upon racial dogma as a
myth.
The fight against race discrimination,
which figures in the Unesco Constitu-
tion, will be long. To combat an emo-
tional attitude as deep-seated and dan-
gerous as racial prejudice is not easy. but
by depriving it of. all scientific and
rational justification a great step forward
will have been made.

BALZAC
AND THE HUMAN COMEDY
FEW writers ha'Ye had such a great influence on the literature of all countries as Honoré
de Balzac, who died in Paris, on August 18th, 1850.
Balzac's true literary career started in 1829 after ten years of trying and discourag-
ing apprenticeship. It had exactly twenty. one years to run, yet during this time Baltic,
working with a furious energy, produced an immense and'Yaried total of nO'Yels and phil-
osophical and analytical studies in which, using his gifts of obser'Yation and imagination
and on a scale ne'Yer achie'Yed by any other nO'Yelist, he portrayed the life of his time.
Balzac openly, publicly and proudly pursued fame and money. He affected at times
to hold mankind in contempt. Some critics have asserted that these attitudes were the
whole basis for his work. That work itself, howe'Yer, in its profundity and integrity, giyes

that it could bave had so mean an origin.
In 1842, Balzac carried out the idea of building his work into one structure to which
he gave the name"La ComMie Humaine", and in a preface written for the first'Yolume

As a tribute to Balzac on the centenary of his death, the Courier publishes on this

HONORE DE BALZAC
A portrait by the French painter Court.
IN giving to a work, begun nearly
thirteen years ago, the title of
.. The Human C medy", it is
necessary that I should state its
purpose, relate its origin, and give
some explanation of its plan ;
endeavouring to do so as if I had no
personal interest in the matter. This
is not as difficult as the public might
imagine. The writing of a few books
makes a man self-sufficient ; but
much labour and hard toil bring
humility. This reflection explains
the survey which Corneille, Moliere,
and other great authors made of
their writings. If it is impossible to
equal them in the grandeur of their
conceptions, at least we may share
the spirit with which they examined
them.
The leading idea of this human
comedy came to me at first like a
dream ; like one of those impossible
visions which we try to clasp as they
elude us ; a smiling fancy showing
for a moment a woman's face, as it
spreads its wings and rises to the
ideal heavens. But soon this vision,
this chimera, changed, after the
fashion of chimeras, into a living
shape with compelling will and
tyrannical power, to which I yielded
myself up. The idea came from the
study of human life in comparison
with the life of animals.
It is a mistake to suppose that the
controversy which in these latter
days has arisen between Cuvier and
Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire rests upon a'
scientific innovation. Synthetic unity
filled, under various definitions, the
greatest minds of the two preceding
centuries. In reading the strange
books of those mystical writers who
drew science into their conceptions
of the infinite-such as Sweden-
borg, Saint-Martin, and others ; also
the writings of the great naturalists,
Leibnitz, Buffon, Charles Bonnet,
etc.-we find in the monads of
Leibnitz, in the organic molecules of
Buffon, in the vegetative force of
Needham, in the encasement of
germs of Charles Bonnet, who was
bold enough to write in 1760,
"animal life vegetates like plant
life"-we find, I say, the rudiments
of that strong law of self-
preservation upon which rests the
theory of synthetic unity.
Society Makes The Man
THERE ITS but one animal. The
Creator used one and the same
principle for all organized
being. An animal is an essence
which takes external form, or, to
speak more correctly, takes the
differences of its form from the
centres or conditions in which it
comes to its development. All
zoological species grow out of these
differences.
The announcement and pursuit of
this theory, keeping it as he did in
harmony with preconceived ideas of
the Divine power, will be the lasting
glory of Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, the
conqueror of Cuvier in this particular
branch of science-a fact recognized
by the great Goethe in the last words
which came from his pen.
Filled with these ideas, I had
perceived, long before this discussion
arose, that Society in these respects
is like Nature. Society makes the
man ; he develops according to the
social centres in which he is placed :
there are as many different men as
there are species in zoology.'rhe
differences between a soldier, a
workman, a governor, a lawyer, a
man of leisure, a scholar, a
statesman, a merchant, a sailor, a
poet, a beggar, a priest, though more
difficult to decipher, are at least as
marked as those which separate the
wolf, the lion, the ass, the crow, the
shark, the seal, the lamb, etc. There
have always been, and always will
be, social species just as there are
zoological species. If Buffon
achieved a great work when he put
together in one book the whole
scheme of zoology, is there not a
work of the same kind to be done
for Society ?
Mankind's Complicated
Struggle
NATURE imposes upon the animalKingdom limitations which do
not bind the social realm. When
Buffon had described a lion, he
could dismiss the lioness with a
word ; but in the world of men,
woman is far from being the female
of the male. Two species of
mankind may exist in one household :
the wife of a shopkeeper is some-
times fit to be the wife of a prince ;
often the wife of a prince is
unworthy to be the companion of the
meanest labourer. The Social king-
dom has uncertainties and accidents
which are not to be found in the
natural world, for it is itself Nature
plus Society. Any description of the
social species, consequently, doubles
all description of the animal species
in the matter of the sexes alone.
... Buffon found the life of animals
extremely simple. They have no
belongings, neither arts nor sciences ;
while man, by a law still un-
explained, feels the need to set the
stamp of his habits, his thoughts, his
being, upon all that he collects to
meet his wants. Though Leuwen-
h o e c, Swammerdam, Spallanzani,
Réaumur, Charles Bonnet, Muller,
Haller, and other patient zoologists
proclaim the interest which attaches
to the habits of animals, yet to our
eyes at least they remain perpetually
the same ; whereas the habits,
clothing, methods of speech, the
abodes of princes, bankers, artists,
citizens, priests, and paupers, are all
widely dissimilar, and change with
the whims of civilization.
For these reasons my ideal work
took on a triple form,-men,
women, and things ; that is to say,
persons and the material represent-
ation which they gave to their being :
in short, man and his life.
Portrait Of An Epoch
IT has been no light task topaint the three or four* * * thousand salient figures of an
epoch,-for that is about the
number of types presented by the
generation of which this human
that social antithesis-furnished the
data.
Some years after Balzac's death, the"Socié-
té des Gens de Lettres" (The French
nuthors'Association) commissioned Rodin,
the famous sculptor, to execute a statue of
the novelist. Rodin carried out a great deal of
research, studied lithographs and engravings
and read Balzac's works for he aimed to
portray the character of the novelist rather
than his physical likeness. The final result
(shown in the photograph above) was a
synthesis of the two, but the French writers
refused to accept it. It was not until 1939
that a bronze was cast and this now stands
at the junction of two Paris streets while the
original work is preserved in the Muse
Rodin. in Paris.
comedy is the contemporary and the
exponent. This number of figure,
of characters, this multitude of por-
traits needed frames, permit me even
to say galleries. Out of this neces-
sity grew the classification of my
work into Scenes-scenes from
private, provincial, Parisian, politi-
cal, military, and country life. Under
these heads I have classed all those
studies of manners and morals which
form the general history of Society
and of its"conduct of life and noble
deeds" (faits et gestes), to use the
language of our ancestors. These
six divisions follow a general idea ;
each has its meaning and signific-
ation, and represents a distinct phase
in human life. The"Scenes from
private life"are those of childhood
and of youth, just as the.'Scenes
from provincial life"represent the
age of passions, calculations, self-
interest, and ambition. The"Scenes
from Parisian life"draw the picture
of tastes, fashions, sentiments, vices,
and all those unbridled extravagan-
ces excited by the life of great cities,
where meet together the extremes of
good and the extremes of evil. Each
of these three divisions has its local
colour. Paris and the provinces-
Society In Convulsion
AFTER drawing these three
sections of Society, I wished
'''two show certain other
phases of life which unite the
interests of some or of all. and yet
are partly aloof from the common
order. Out of this desire came the
"Scenes from political life", also
the"Scenes from military life" ; in
the latter I have sought to show
Society in convulsion, carried out of
itself either for conquest or for
defence. Finally, the"Scenes from
country life"are, as it were, the
evening of my long day's-work, if I
may so call this social drama. In
this division will be found my purest
characters ; also the application of
the great principles of order, of
patriotism, and of morality.
Such is the structure, teeming with
life, full of comedy and of tragedy,
on which I base the,"Philosophical
Studies"which form the second part
of my work. In these I have shown
the keynote of that vast assemblage
of all that strikes the eye, that
captivates the mind or touches the
heart ; I have shown the havoc that
has followed thought, step ; by step,
from emotion to emotion.
The Public Will Decide
ABoVE these again will be
f 0 u n d the"Analytical
... Studies", of wh ch I shall
say nothing, as only one of them has
been published. Later, I hope to
give other works of the same class,
- the., Pathology of Social life"the
"Anatomy of Educating bodies", the"Monopraph of Virtue", etc.
Looking at the work still to be
done, perhaps my readers will join
my publishers in saying,"May your
life be prolonged !" may own prayer
is that I may not be so tortured by
men and events as I have been in
the past, since the beginning of my
great and terrible labour. Yet I have
had one support, for which I return
thanks to God. The highest talent
of our day, the noblest characters, the
truest friends, have clasped my hand
and said to me,"Take courage !"
Why should I not ; own that such
proofs of affection, such testimonials
given now and then by strangers,
have upheld me in my career in spite
of myself, in spite of unjust attacks,
in spite of calumnies that have
pursued me,-upheld me against
disheartenment, and also against that
too-vivid hope, the expression of
which has been mistaken for exces-
sive conceit.
The extent of a plan which em-
braces both the history and the
criticism of Society, which analyzes
its evils and lays bare its hidden
springs, justifies me, I think, in
giving to my work the title under
which it now appears,-"The
Human Comedy". Is it ambitious ?
Is it not just and legitimate ? The
public, when my work is done, will
decide.

### 81494: Many nations seek new uses for free fuel

POW E R-T HAT COM E S WIT H T H'E WIN D
MANY NATIONS
SEEK NEW USES
FOR"FREE FUEL"
WINDMILLS are going up again in various parts of the world.
But not the classical friendly-looking Dutch type with
which we are all familiar. The new mill  are designed
to capture the power from the wind and to translate it,
on a large scale, into electrical energy ! for use in homes and
industry. They are an expression of the fact that many countries
face increasing shortages of coal and oil and that wind power
may, in many cases. prove an admirable substitute for, or addition
other forms of power.
Countries such as the U. S. A., Denmark, France, the Netherlands
and Britain already have teams of experts investigating how the
winds which blow over their countries can be captured to produce
more electrical power.
The British have set up a Wind
Power Research Station in the
Orkney Islands, where it is propos-
ed to erect a 100 kwt. generator
which will be tied in with the
electricity supply servicing the
islands. It is estimated that the
western coastal districts or Britain
are among the windi, est in the
world, and experts say that only a
few hundred feet above the ground,
millions of horse power in the form
of wind cross the coasts on a
windy day.
Free And Inexhaustible
A KEPORT issued two years agoby the British Electrical and
Allied Industries Research
Association gave a tentative esti-
mate that between 7. 75 and 7. 5 mil-
lion kwt. hours of electricity might
be generated yearly in Great Bri-
tain by wind power. This'would
be equivalent to a saving of from
2 to 4 million tons of coal.
In these terms, wind power is of
distinct economic importance. Its
supply is free and inexhaustible.
The British expert, Mr. E. W.
Golding, points out that there are,
however, two main disadvantages
which must be met if it is to be
used economically for electricity
supply : the low energy content
per unit of volume of air, and its
uncertain availability at any par-
ticular time.
The first disadvantage is likely
to result in relatively high costs
for storage facilities which will
preserve the energy for use during
non-windy periods. It is Mr. Gold-
ing's opinion that storage should
be ruled out in large-scale opera-
tions, and that wind power should
be used as and when it is available.
The windmill must therefore be
erected on very windy sites in
close proximity to local networks
of electricity supply.
Mr. Golding calculates that, for
Britain, wind power can be
produced at a cost of. 24d. to. 38d.
per kilowatt-hour, which compares

### 81495: World Power Conference to consider latest UNESCO discussion theme

"ENERGY IN THE SERVICE OFMAN", the theme which.
UNESCO has chosen as a dis-
cussion topic for 1950-1951, was the
subject considered in its technical as-
pects at the Fourth World Power Con-
íerence in London during July.
The Chairman of the Conference,
Sir Harold Hartley, was also chairman
of the committee of experts who met
at Unesco House in Paris last October
and who advised on the aspects of
"Energy in the Service of Man"to be
written on in CI special series of six
booklets. These are due to appear
this month and will provide basic
material which can be used for popu-
larization and discussion. Authors
include Sir Alfred Egerton, Prof. F. E.
Simon. U. K., Dr. M. S. Thacker, India,
Prof. Gustcsv Eichelberg, Switzerland,
and M. Pierre Ailleret, France.
Sir Harold Hartley is also President
of the British Association for the Ad-
vancement of Science, whose annual
meeting will be held at Birmingham
England on September 11. Refer-
ring to this meeting,"Nature", the
leading science journal recently wrote :
"He has chosen the title'Man's Use
of Energy', and it would be difficult
to find a topic more appropriate to the
times, or to the place of the Associa-
tan's meeting.
"The Unesco discussion theme for the
year is'Energy in the Service of Man'
SIR HAROLD HARTLEY
which differs from Sir Harold's title
mainly by being easier to translate
into French. This same theme will be
made prominent during the meeting by
discussions in several of the thirteen
sections. Civil applications of nuclear
energy, the harnpssing of chemical
energy, the use of power by primitive
man, and gas turbines will come under
review by the physics, chemistry.

respectively.
"An exhibition illustrating this central
topic of the meeting is being organized,
and a series of five public lectures on
its various aspects will be given in
Birmingham by distinguished spea-
kers."

favourably with the cost of fuel
in a steam-driven power station,
at an average figure of 4d.
Denmark's Power Problem
THE Danish government hasbeen experimenting in. wind
power plants since the end
of the last century. Between
1900 and 1910, several hundred
wind power plants of 3 to 30 ikW
capacity were set up. These were
used partly to supply current to
big estates, and partly to supply
villages. These wind power plants
were based on batteries, small size
petroleum motors often being used
during calm weather. They were
in operation for 25 to 30 years
until the high tension plants
superseded them.
Now, as electricity has become
almost the main source of power
supply in Denmark, it has become
necessary to secure a steady
supply. This, in connection with
high coal prices and the difficulty
of importing fuel, is the reason
why the question of the rational
utilisation of wind power has again
been taken up. Wind power is, in
fact, the only natural large-scale
source of power in Denmark.
For the past three years, the
South East Zealand Electricity Co
has been doing researches in this
field. A trial mill has been built
and a wind power plant will prob-
ably be erected. These plants
Icill most profitably be set up on
western coasts and, in adequate
numbers, will be able to yield 60 %
to 70 % of the power supply needed
at any time in Denmark.
In Italy, researches in this field
began in 1940. The French have
installed more than 100 special
instruments in France, North
Africa and in certain colonial ter-
ritories. Preliminary results indic-
ate that the best areas in France
for wind power machines are on
the Mediterranean coast, along
the northern half of the Spanish
frontier, near the mouth of the
Rhone, in Brittany, and along the
coast near the Belgian frontier.
There is also an apparatus at the
top of the Eiffel Tower in Paris
to collect data on wind velocity.
Main interest at the moment is
in two types of windmills. In one,
instead of pumping water or opera-
ting a millstone, the drive shaft
turns an electric generator. The
other is : made up of'a hollow pro-
pellor with three blades, which are
open at the tips. When the propel-
lor rotates the air is expelled from
the tips by centrifugal force, which
creates a vacuum so that air is
sucked through the air turbine,
which drives the generator. The
advantage of this latter type of
windmill is that the generators,
weighing as much as 250 tons, are
kept on the ground and not, as in
other windmills, perched on top of
the windmill tower.

### 81499: A Song for Ameland

SWORDS INTO PLOUGHSHARES. At Ameland. 30 volunteers from 11
countries worked hard to turn a German radar station into a summer
holiday hostel. Toiling side by side with pick, shovel and paintbrush,
they did a constructive job in the cause 01 peaceful international relations.
They also left behind something symbolic 01 their work"A Song for
Ameland".
A THEME SONG FOR THE WORK CAMP. One night, Daniel, a French
volunteer lay on his bunk and played a few notes of a folk melody
recalled from his native Basque region. The other campers picked up
the song and by next day the camp triad a theme song to speed its
work along. Later, the villagers learned the song. Today, it still
reminds them of the young people who came to help from such far away
places as Indonesia and America.
A SONG FOR AME1AND
A MELAND, a little island off the Dutch
coast was marked on German staff
maps during the war as a strong
point on the"Atlantic Wall", with a
radar station to give warning of the ap-
proach of enemy planes and ships.
Although the steel and concrete defence, ;
were demolished after the war, the metal
frame and buildings of the radar station
were still there in 1949 on the site where
the Dutch Youth Hostel movement planned
to build a summer holiday camp.
Answering an appeal for help, issued
through the International Youth Hostel As-
sociation, volunteers from many countries
came to the tiny island during the summer
of 1949.
The way in which these young people,
strangers to one another, formed a living,
working community-doing a constructiv
job and providing an example of interna-
tional harmony-is the theme of a dramatic
French film,"A Song for Ameland", which
is to be released shortly.
The film was made after Jean Leduc and

The 20-minute film shows that first con-
tacts between them were not always easy
because of differences in customs, language
barriers, a feeling of loneliness and home-
sickness and, to some extent, the reserve of
the local people.
Finally, it was a song, played on a mouth
organ one evening by Daniel, a young
Frenchman, sung in chorus the next day and
eventually adopted by the villagers of Ame-
land, that broke down all barriers of iso-
lation and created a real community spirit.

### 81497: The World's stages: a platform for peace

THE International Theatre Institute (ITI) is one of the specialized"non-governmental"organizations, set up within the framework
of the United Nations. It was founded in 1948 under the auspices of
UNESCO after a series of consultations between UNESCO's Theatre Ser-
vices and individuals prominent in the international theatre. The ITI
is made up of National Centres representative of the theatrical life of
each member country. Official delegates from these Centres constitute
the annual Congress, which is the governing body of the Institute.
The goal of the organization is to
encourage and facilitate"inter-
national exchange of knowledge
and practice in theatre arts"
through exchange of information,
by facilitating international circu-
lation of theatre people and by
helping to arrange tours for young
managers, directors, authors, desi-
gners, etc., desirous of completing
their studies by a period of work
abroad.
"sine theatrical art is a univer-sal expression of mankind
and possesses the influence
and power to link large groups of the
world's peoples... we have decided to
form an autonomous international
organization... whose purpose is to
promote international exchange of
knowledge and practices in theatre
arts..."
When the International Theatre
Institute (ITI) from whose charter
the above extracts are taken, was
founded at Prague in 1948, eight
nations signified their belief in its
purpose and worth, by signing the
Charter,
Today, the ITI has 25 member
countries and to its Third Annual
Congress which ended in Paris on
June 29th, ten other nations sent
observers. But, equally important,
is the progress made by the National
Centres towards"promoting inter-
national exchange of knowledge and
practices of theatre arts"thereby
helping international understanding.
Already this year many centres
organized an International Theatre
Week-in the United States the
"Week"became a Theatre Month in
48 states-and it is planned to
extend these celebrations to many
more countries during the first
quarter of 1951.
Under one of the plans adopted by
the Paris Congress, to give a more
universal tone to next year's Theatre
Week, the ITI will choose an author,
probably from Norway, where the
1951 Congress is to be held, and will
distribute a list of his plays to all

tional Theatre Institute.
member countries. One of these
plans, having a universal idea pro-
moting international understanding,
will be suggested for production
during the Theatre Week.
A proposal by Yugoslavia for
presentation in 1951 of a series of
plays stressing the ideals of peace
was also adopted.
The Congress asked national
centres to form"ITI Clubs"whose
members would help publicize the
movement, assist visiting foreign
players, and arrange international
Theatre Weeks and Festivals.
The Congress also proposed that
the term"`work of art"be defined by
legal authorities working on Interna-
tional Cultural Agreements to inclu-
de all items of theatrical equipment,
decors, drapes, curtains, properties,
costumes, musical instruments and
all electrical equipment, It was sug-
gested that exemption from taxes be
discussed by countries which have
signed cultural agreements, with a
view to including such exemptions
Qn a reciprocal basis. Non-profit per-
formances for school-children would
be exempt from national and local
taxes.
Among other projects approved by
the Third Congress were : full
support for Unesco's efforts in
drawing up a new Universal Copy-
right Convention ; assistance in the
publication of a glossary of technical
theatrical terms in five languages ;
a study of children's theatres
throughout the work by the next
Congress ; an enquiry into the possi-
bility of creating an International
Theatre in Paris and the provision
of grants in aid for the exchange of
theatre professionals between ITI
Centres.
Before the opening of the Congress
by Dr. Emile Oprecht (Switzerland),
a former ITI chairman, a Conference
of Experts on Modern Theatre
Architecture, was held from June
19th to 21st.
For the first time, a group of Ger-
man experts took part in this confer-
ence on modern theatre architecture
along with the member states. The
debates of the technicians and artists
were illustrated by an Exhibition
which proved a great success with
members of the public. This exhi-
bition will be taken over by certain
centres and the German technicians
are presenting it tin Berlin when
they hold their annual meeting this
year.

Refugee Musical
"ambassadors 
Tour
Western Europe
To draw attention to the plight of over 650qualified musicians and singers still living
in International Refugee Organization
(IRO) camps in Germany, Austria and Italy, five
refugee musicians made a concert tour under IRO
sponsorship to several Western European capitals
during July.
These five musicians-violinists Elise Cser-
falvi, 22, and Arpad Gerecz, 25, both of Budapest ;
pianists Charles Reiner, 26, of Budapest, and
Boris Maximowicz, 44, of Kiev ; and 26 years old
basso Ladislas Pudis, of Czechoslovakia-were
selected at a competition by a jury of Geneva
Conservatory professors.
Together with accompanist Siegfried Oehl-
giesser, also a stateless refugee, these artists
gave performances in Geneva, Zurich, Amster-
dam, Paris and London.
The concert tour was organized by the IRO to
awaken world attention to the problem of refugee
intellectuals and artists who, five years after the
war's end, are still waiting for a chance to leave
the displaced persons camps of Central Europe.
In January 1950, there were still 38, 000
refugees registered with IRO who were pro-
fessional and managerial workers, or members of
their families.
The Director General of IRO, Mr. Donald
Kingsley, has appealed to the governments of
the world to find new homes for this"forgotten
elite"before this U. N. specialised agency closes
down on March 31st next year.

FREEDOM had waited through the centuries forevents which took place in Philadelphia, in the
American colony of Pennsylvania, on the 4th of
July 1776. and in Paris, France, on the 14th of July 1'789.
These events did not concern only the. Americans and
the French, but all men, everywhere. They did not
concern only the men of the late 18th century, but all
who have lived since that time, and those who will live,
during the foreseeable future.
The American Declaration of Independence, drawing
its words and thoughts from the whole history of the
struggle for human rights, declared :
"We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men
are created equal, that they are endowed by their
Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among
these are Litre, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."
Thirteen years and ten days later, in the name of
Liberty, Equality and Fraternity, the people of France
smashed the gates of the Bastille, and dealt a blow
to the concept of absolute monarchy which echoed
across the world.

this famous surgeon, carrying out research into the
nerve centres of the brain, identified the centre that
governs speech-the third frontal convolution,
generally referred to since then as"Broca's convo-

of Paris, and his discovery established him as a master
of comparative anatomy and a pioneer in the domain
of anthropology. Broca died before completing his
study on cerebral morphology.
FABRE D'EGLANTINE
During a period of twelve years, from 1793 to 1805,
Frenchmen dated their letters"ler Floréal"or"16 Fri-

Public Opinion, and dedicated the different days of the
year to the Grape, the Chestnut, the Vat and so forth.
instead of to the saints. The man responsible for this
was a middle-class citizen of Carcassone born on the
28th of July 1750 with the very ordinary name of Fabre.
He added the rest after winning the prize of a golden
eglantine for an ode he submitted to the Jeux Floraux
of Toulouse. Fabre d'Eglantine began his career as a
mediocre playwright, then became a revolutionary,
followed Danton faithfully through every phase of his
career-and went to the guillotine in the same tumbril
as his leader. But he will be remembered for his
calendar, with its charming headings, and by a few

on the 29th of July, 1890, was a

### 81504: 1950 UNESCO seminars chart a way to world understanding through improved educational techniques

1950 UNESCO SEMINARS MARIA WAY
TO WORLD UNDERSTANDING THROUGH
IMPROVED EDUCATIONAL TECHNIQUES
UNESCO has developed a special form of international study meeting or
.. seminar", where educators from many countries are brought together
to make extensive studies of specific educational problems, to draw up
plans and suggestions for action in their respective countries, to prepare materials
for national and international use.
The most important feature of each Seminar is the s"T1all, informal study group
in which information is exchanged, ideas and methods are discussed and solutions
to problems are suggested. The usual techniques of conferences, with commiStees
and formal voting, are not employed. The Seminar is a working party of practical
people who pool their resources for the solution of common problems, and the
participants come as individuals, not as delegates representing an institution or
a particular point of view. They are workers in a common field, where
everybody's contribution is valuable and the results will be the product
of everybody's thinking.
Unesco's seminar on the improvement of textbooks is being held in the Cite Universitaire
Paul Héger (above), which forms part of the Université Libre. in Brussels. The Cite Uni-
versitaire provides board and lodging, at exceptionally low rates, tor foreign students and
for Belgian students whose homes are far from Brussels. The Université Libre de Bruxelles
is one of Belgium's four Universities, the three others being the University of Louvain (a
Catholic foundation), and two State Universities (Liege and Ghent).
Over fifty librarians and experts in adult education met in the Malmö City Library, (above)
at the end 01 luly, for the Unesco seminar on the role 01 libraries in adult education. Maims,
Sweden's third city. was chosen as the seminar site because 01 the excellence 01 its library
facilities and their rural extensions.
ON the afternoon of July 12th
educators from 24 countries
gat red at the Cité Universitaire
of the Université Libre in
Brussels. Six hours later and some
3, 000 miles away in Canada, a similar
group of about 50 educators began to
assemble at Macdonald College-part
of McGill University-near Montreal.
The men and women in both groups
- participants in two international
educational seminars organized by
Unesco-had travelled to Canada and
to Belgium to spend six rweeks
together, to study two closely related
aspects of the same problem-how
to make the most effective use of
education in developing international
understanding.
While members of the Brussels
Seminar discuss practical means for
improving textbooks, particularly
history books, their colleagues in
Canada are examining ways in which
geography teaching can help to
develop international understanding.
Both seminars will end on August
23rd.
. International'National History
Books
SINCE 1946 Unesco has worked forgreater mutual tolerance, har-
mony and understanding between
the peoples of different nations by seek-
ing to improve textbooks and teach-
ing materials. In the Brussels Seminar,
educators are going beyond purely
theoretical study to examine practical
classroom problems, concerning the
evaluation and use of textbooks, which
face their colleagues in all countries.
In its study of methods for analys-
ing and improving textbooks, the
S e m i n a r is applying Unesco's
"Model Plan"to sample material.
This plan, prepared by Dr. I. James
Quillen, of Stanford University,
provides many practical proposals for
"testing"books and encouraging
higher standards of writing and
selection.
By dividing themselves into four
working groups, members of the
Seminar are able to pool their
specialized knowledge, skill and
experience to solve technical and
professional problems of textbook
writers as well as teachers, and to
Macdonald College, where the Unesco Seminar on Geography teaching as a Means of
Developing International Understanding opened on July l2th, houses the Faculty 01 Agri-

deal with the varied educational and
psychological problems involved in
attempts to improve international
understanding.
One group is dealing with the ques-
tion of generally raising the level of
all textbooks, while the second group
discusses the best ways of using books
in classrooms.
The third group is seeking answers
to such questions as"Can national
history textbooks be written from an
international viewpoint ?"
World history textbooks will be
dealt with by the fourth group whose
work includes a comparative study of
the terms of national, general and
universal history and the history of
civilization in relation to international
understanding.
An important objective for the
Seminar, whose director is M. A : Wei-
ler, headmaster of the Experimental
Secondary School at Montgeron,
France, is to produce studies, biblio-
graphies and other materials for us
in future textbook improvement
campaigns.
Geography Creates Community
Spirit
GEOGRAPHY, when well taught.can make a child realize that he
is a member of a great human
community, in which he has both
privileges and obligations. Geography
teaching can and should help to
increase respect for others, and above
all, the sense of community on
regional, national and international
levels. For the experts meeting at
Unesco's seminar in Canada, the
problem is therefore to define
methods which can be used in
geography teaching to encourage
world-mindedness and international
understanding.
To do this they will make compar-
ative studies of geography teaching
in the schools of the various countries
represented at the Seminar, par-
ticularly in primary and secondary
schools, explore the possibilities for
improving the professional and
technical training of teachers and also
suggest specific ways in which
geography can lead towards intern-
ational understanding.
Four of the five study groups are
dealing with these factors in relation
to the needs of children and students
in different age groups. For the
youngest children, particular attention
will be paid to the use of films, radio,
books, folk tales and other methods,
to broaden the children's interest
beyond their immediate environment

- and to show more of the relation
of their home towns to towns and
cities in other parts of the world.
Another group, dealing with the
needs of students from 12 to 15, is
examining special teaching methods
and psychological approaches most
suitable for them.
During the course of the Seminar,
plenary sessions are held, at which
group leaders report on the work
carried out, so that other group
members get an overall picture of
progress made and also join in
discussions of the problems which are
outlined.
The reports and studies produced by
the Seminar are to be published by
Unesco as guides to educational
authorities and teachers in all parts
of the world.
Libraries Serving Adult Education
T TWELVE days after the opening ofthe two Unesco seminars on
education for international un-
derstanding, about fifty professional
librarians and experts in adult
education met in Maims, Sweden's
third largest city, to study the role
of libraries in adult education.
Although a library seminar-
Unesco's second-the Malmö
"workshop"is a direct outcome of
recommendations made at the Elsinore
conference on adult education last
summer, and is closely linked with the
seminar on adult education techni-
ques, just concluded near Salzburg,
Austria.
The experts brought to Malmö
reports on library adult education
techniques, methods, policies and
programmes in their own countries.
These reports, together with the
booklet,'''Adult Education Activities
for Public Libraries", just published
by Unesco, give a broad picture of
what libraries are doing in the service
of adult education.
. Mankind Is On The March'
-UNESCO'S fourth 1950 Seminar, unmethods and techniques of ad lt
education, took place at Kreutz-
stein, about 25 miles from Salzburg.
Austria, from June 18th to July 29th.
Over 70 men and women from 20
countries constituted a temporary
international community, living and
working in a lakeside hotel, exchange-
ina their experiences-both successes
and failures-in adult education, to
provide a full picture of its present
state in various parts of the world,
and a basis for future action.
Dr. Lionel Elvin, recently appointed
head of Unesco's Education Depart-
ment, was present at the opening of
the Seminar, when delegates werr
welcomed by Dr. Hurdes, Austrian
Minister of Education. Dr. Elvin
read Ii message from M. Jaime Torres
Bodet, Unesco's Director-General, in
which the latter stressed"the un-
challengeable evidence that in adult
education mankind is on the march"
Director of the Kreutzstein Seminar
was Dr. Sven Bjorklund. Dean and
tounder of the Stockholm Peoples
University and one of the outstanding
figures in the Scandinavian adult
education movement.
Under the direction of M. Jacques
Brunet. of Unesco's Film Division, one
seminar group prepared a film on the
methods and techniques of adult
education as applied at the Seminar.
Other successful seminar projects
were a radio programme, a bi-weekly
newspaper, a mural journal, and a full
report of the Seminar's work to serve
as a guide to adult education groups.
These and other aspects of the
Seminar's work are already being put
to practical use in hundreds of
neighborhood clubs, union halls, rural
centres, schools, colleges, etc. in all
parts of the world.

ters were developing their talents as exiles in
this part, of Russia.
For trying to escape from Siberia, Sieroszew-
ski was sent to Yakutsk where he began to work
both as a novelist and a sociologist. When he
published his"Twelve Years in the Country of

When this Austrian poet wrote an epic on
Savonarola it ways much less with the aim of
evoking a specific historical period than to
defend the idea of liberty. Again, in his famous

themes-tolerance and democracy. Lenau
yearned for a free life in the vast spaces of the
New World, but after spending an Autumn in

despondent and felt that his work had been
useless. But, in his last writings were these
prophetic words :"People will understand me
after the next European war."He had pre-
dicted the terrible war-clouded days that were
to come and ascribed a cause :"the corruption
of nationalism, the slow poisoning that causes
nations to draw away from other nations. *
He had hoped, with almost dangerous
obstinacy, for a renaissance. Sometimes enthu-
siastically, sometimes fearfully, he asked him-
self :"Is the ennoblement of mankind possible ?'

### 81506: How Salerno lighted a path through the dark ages

lOW SALERNO IIGITED
A PI TI TIROUGI TIE
"DARK AGES"
by Dr. Riccardo LUZZATO
WHEN the Provinces of the Western Empire wereoverfiooded by primitive warrior tribes in the fifth
century, the great wealth of scientific knowledge
created and accumulated by the Romans, Greeks and the
older eastern civilizations seemed irretrievably lost to
Europe. Yet, during the troubled centuries of the early
Middle Ages there was established an international
scientific organization which was to flourish for more
than 500 years, in the face of all the violent prejudice
At the start 01 the ninth century, Salerno was simply a little coastal
town to whose hospital came many sick people from Rome. Gradually,
more doctors arrived in Salerno and they were followed by students
of both sexes (as is shown in the above engraving) from many Medi-
terranean and Western European countries. The medical school of
Salerno-"the most celebrated of all those formed in the West after
the fall of the Roman Empire"came into being. It ofücially ceased
to exist in 1811, but already for some time past had only existed in
name. Today, not a stone remains of the famous"Hippocratic City"
where generations of doctors from many countries worked for the
advancement of medical science.
then prevailing in the Christian
world.
Sometime during the ninth
century, in the lovely seaside
town of Salerno in Southern
Italy, a school was founded
which was to renew and
preserve medical knowledge for
the \World and provide an
everlasting example of the
practicality and importance of
intercultural co-operation.
The masters oj Salerno stimulated enthusiasm
for scientific experiment throughout Europe
for many years. Such experiments included
that made by a sixteenth century Venetian
doctor named Sanctorius. who invented a
balance to help him determine the amounl
and weight 01 perspiration given oij by the
human body in relation to the effects 01
lood and drink. The above engraving shows
Sanctorius itting in the balance he invented.
The Venetian doctor calculated that for every
8 lbs. oj food and drink consumed in a day,
5 Ibs. were lost through the pores oj the
skin. The importance oj this knowledge, he
held. was that"most illnesses are caused
through an excels or a lack oj perspiration".
History at that time did not
yet reach the remarkable
standards of medical science,
and records are incomplete
about the early days of the
Civitas Hippocratica, as the
school was called in honour of
the greatest physician of An-
cient Greece. Modern histo-
rians generally agree however,
in ascribing its foundations to
four scholars : Master Adela,
an Arab, Master He-
linus, a Jew, Master
Pcntus, a Greek-and
Master Salernus, an
Italian. Each taught
in his language, which
meant Latin for Saler-
nus and Hebrew for
Helinus.
The next news we
have states that in 904
a Salernitan physi-
cian was in residence
at the court of the
King of France. In
984, Alberon, Bishop of
Verdun, came to seek
the advice of the
Salernitan physicians.
At a later period many
other princes of the
Church and secular
rulers had recourse to
their aid.
The international
character of the insti-
tution is illustrated
by the fact that the
nationality of many of
its famous teachers
was hardly known. At

thousands of students
who came from Arabia,
Africa, Spain, Britain,
Palestine, Northern
France and other countries
knew and cared little about
the origins of their professors.
This applies, for instance, to
Gabriopontus who died about
líJ50. Some historians think he
was a Greek, others that he
was a Lombard, others again
that he was a Salernitan.
Works Of"Dame Trot"
OKIE of his best knownsuccessors, Constantinus
Africanus, was born in Car-
thage and made long journeys
to Syria, Egypt, Ethiopia and
India, to bring the latest
achievements of Eastern
science to Salerno.
The passion for science at
Salerno was strong enough to
overcome more than one form
of prejudice. A prominent fi-
gure of the early period was
the woman physician Trotula,
about whose personality little
is known, although she left a
number of medical treatises
which were used as textbooks
up to the sixteenth century
and were first printed by
Aldus in Venice in 1547. Other
women too were admitted to
the lectures and to study.
Woman doctor Tr otul a
acquired such a wide fame,
that she gained a certain
popularity in old English liter-
ature under the name of
"Dame Trot"and became
Madame Trotte in the thirt-
eenth century medical trou-
vère Rutebceuf (Le Dex de
I'Erberle).

THE FOUR HUMAN TEMPERAMENTS
QUATUOR HUMORES HUMANO CORPORE CONSTANT : SANGUIS CUM
CHOLERA. MELANCHOLIA QUOQUE, PHLEGMA. According to the
Salerno School :"Those of sanguine temperament, servants of Venus
and favourites of Bacchus, have a jovial humour... the choleric man
has a bold heart but a lean body, slender and sickly.... The melan-
cholic person, of a sombre and sometimes crabbed humour, is diligenl
in his studies, but sleeps badly and broods over his plan. with
stubborn concentration.... As for the phlegmatic person, he is short
of stature, broad and thick-set and frigidly resists all forms of agitation..."
Written records of the Sa-
lerno school show the influence
upon it of the great Arabian
schools of the Orient and
Mohammedan Spain. The Per-
sian physicians Rhazes (865-
925) and Avicenna (980-1037) ;
and the Spanish Arabians
Avenzoar (1113-1162) and
Averroes (1126-1198), as well
as the great Maimonides, a
Spanish Jew (1135-1204), were
intensively studied at Salerno.

Jewish physicians, the urolo-
gist Isaac Judaeus (9th or lOth

in the so-called Dark Ages,
was the long-continued colla-
boration of Christians, Mos-
lems and Jews, during the
whole of European history's
"crusading season". To the
average European of the Middle
Ages, whoever did not belong
to the orthodox Christian
Church, whether he was a Jew,
a Moslem, a Hindu, a pagan-
or worst of all a heretic-was

century) had studied and
taught at the Salerno school.
From Salerno and Mont-
pellier came also the famous
French physician Pierre Gilles
de Corbeil, who later taught
in Paris and became court
physician to King Philippe
Auguste. The Emperor Fred-
erick II, son of a Norman
Italian mother and a German
father, followed the recom-
mendations of the school of
Salerno. At his brilliant court
at Palermo the dignitaries
were chosen from among great
thinkers, regardless of their
ancestry or creed, and Arabic
was almost as largely used as
Italian and Latin. As Jatf' :'I. S
1413 King Ladislaus of Hun-
gary gave special privileges to
Salerno teachers.
The school made one. par-
ticularly memorable literary
contribution, in the poem
"Regimen Sanitatis Salernita-
num", probably dedicated to
Robert, eldest son of William
the Conqueror and pretender
to the throne of England. It
was re-edited over 300 times
and translated into many lan-
guages. From Arnold of Vil-
lanova's edition in 1553 may be
quoted the following verses :
"The Salerne School doth by
these lines impart All health
to England's King and doth
aduise, From care his head to
keepe, from wrath his heart...
Use three Physicians still :
first Doctor Quiet, Next Doctor
Merry-Man and Doctor Dyet"
and to on for 362 stanzas.
A Scientific Renaissance
SALERNO re-awakened ascientific spirit, i depen-
dent of dogmatic doctrines :
, revived ancient texts, and
inspired its students to a calm
and critical appraisal of facts
as they found them. Thus,
Salerno paved the way for the
greaF achievements of the uni-
versities of the Renaissance.
Its outstanding accomplish-
ments and its lasting influence
were possible because, right
from the beginning, it over-
came the towering barriers of
religious and national preju-
dice and aimed to make know-
ledge available to the greatest
possible number of people 01
all countries of the. then
known world.
