1990, natural stone
mosaic on cherry wood
base
(75 x 22 cm)
by Marcel Rutti
The work of the
contemporary Swiss
artist Marcel Rutti
has been described
by a critic as
"noteworthy not only
for its creator's
mastery of the art of
mosaic, which he
learned at Ravenna,
but for its
combinations of
colours, its sense of
movement, its
serenity and its
audacity". The
inspiration for the
work shown here was
a performance by a
group of young
Spanish dancers
whose families live in
Switzerland and who
are enthusiastically
keeping alive their
ancestral traditions.
Cubes of marble and
granite imbricated in
wood produce an
effect of rhythm and
dynamism.

Today there are no more
unexplored continents,
unknown seas or mysterious
islands. But while we can
overcome the physical
barriers to exploration, the
barriers of mutual ignorance
between different peoples
and cultures have in many
cases still not been
dismantled.
A modern Ulysses can
voyage to the ends of the
earth. But a different kind of
Odyssey now beckonsan
exploration of the world's
many cultural landscapes,
the ways of life of its
different peoples and their
outlook on the world in
which they live.
It is such an Odyssey that
the Unesco Courier proposes
to its readers. Each month
contributors of different
nationalities provide from
different cultural and

PAULO FREIRÉ. We have often compared our
experiences of literacy work. The lessons you have learned
from your research in ethnoscience coincide in many
respects with what I have called "reading the world".
I have always insisted that literacy, thought of in terms
of reading words, must necessarily,' be preceded by the
"reading" or "deciphering" of the world around us.
Learning to read and write is tantamount to "re-reading"
the world of our experience.
It must never be forgotten that, long before they begin
to learn to form letters, the very young have learned to
speak, to manipulate oral language. Through their family
experience, they "read" the reality of the world around them
long before they can write about it. Later they simply write
what they have learned to say.
Any literacy training process must take this historical
and social fact into account and use it systematically so as
to encourage pupils to practise oral expression, which is
inseparably linked to what I call "reading the world".
Indeed, it is this first reading of the world that incites chil¬
dren to express, by means of signs and sounds, what they
have learned from the universe around them.
Literacy work must take this reality as its point of depar¬
ture and refer to it constantly so as to make possible, thanks
to the greater breadth of knowledge that reading and writing
confer, a more profound decipherment, a "re-reading" of
the world once it has ¡been discovered.
Depending upon the culture involved, this learning
process centres on two poles. On the one hand there is what
might be termed "spontaneous" knowledge; on the other
there is "rigorous" or "scientific" knowledge. In each of
us, there is a conflict between the two. The demands of
rigour are never totally clear and unequivocal and never free
from ideological influences; traces of ideological tendencies
always remain, in the very rigour with which we disclaim
our own ideological background.
MARCIO D'OLNE CAMPOS. I have long been
interested in the differences between the various types of
knowledgepopular, tribal and scientific. With regard to
what you call the "re-reading of the world", the example
of various Indian peoples has led me to a radical revision
of my conception of the role of the educator.
Lack of a system of writing has not prevented these
peoples from devising other methods of recording their
vision of the world and of expressing their relationship with
their immediate environment and the universe at large. This
they convey through personal ornamentation, rites, myths,
and intensive use of the spoken word. Their close involve¬
ment with their environment induces the first, original

### 87648: Reading the world: Paulo Freire talks to Marcio D'Olne Campos
Brazilian educator Paulo Freiré
his friend Marcio D'Olne Campos, ethnoscientist
and teacher, exchange reflections on literacy teaching
and discuss the purpose and conditions of a truly
popular form of education
Paulo Freiré
"reading of the world", which precedesindeed, makes
possiblethe creation of signs and symbols. The "re-reading*
of the world" is thus made manifest through a whole system
of expression that antecedes the symbolism of the alphabet
proper.
This point is a vital one and is almost universally
applicable. In our own Brazilian society, for instance, appar¬
ently arbitrarily selected characters are often imposed on
children, sometimes in an intimidating manner, although
they bear no relation to their experience or the symbolism
they use to express it. Educators do not always seem to be
aware that there may be other symbols than those which
they want to teach their pupils. The gap between teacher
and pupil is even greater in the case of children from Indian
societies, in which the original symbolism is linked to myths
and rites.
I see this standpoint in the world which is specific to
each one of us as the necessary starting point and the raison
d'être of literacy work. We cannot ask children to remain
isolated, as though in a glass capsule, while learning to read
and write, and only later require them to begin to "read"
the world around them.
P.F. I want to stress that teaching should always take
into account the differing levels of knowledge that children
bring with them when they come to school. This intellec¬
tual baggage is an expression of what might be called their
cultural identity and this, of course, is linked to the socio¬
logical concept of class. The teacher must take into account
this initial "reading of the world" that children bring with,
or, rather, within them. For each child, this has been
fashioned within the setting of his or her own home, locality,
and town, and is strongly influenced by social origins.
Schools tend, almost invariably, to discount this prior
knowledge. I am always astonished by the disdain with
which schools, with a few happy exceptions, treat the per¬
ceptual, existential, "lived" experience acquired by the child
outside the school confines. It is as though they want to erase
this other form of language, which constitutes the child's
way of being, sensibility and initial vision of the world, from
his or her mental and physical memory.
This lack of respect for the child's experience has con¬
sequences that are far more deleterious than is generally re¬
alized. It implies a failure to recognize all the inventiveness,
the hundred-and-one artful tricks that children from less

favoured backgrounds employ to defend themselves against
a world that tends to oppress them.
I am not against the assessment of levels of knowledge
in schools. What I object to is the fact that such assessments
should only cover knowledge acquired at school, as if it had
been laid down that nothing important happens outside
school or school hours. No attempt is ever made to forge a
sufficiently strong link between what children learn in
school and what they learn in the world outside.
M.C. The world the child is already deciphering.
P.F. And which he or she never ceases to decipher.
This lack of consideration towards knowledge derived from
experience seems to me to be not only an ideologico-political
choice, but also to indicate a certain scientific incompetence.
Schools are authoritarian and elitist because they furnish
ready-made knowledge, a package that is supposedly com¬
plete. Such a conception of knowledge is scientific nonsense,
an epistemological falsification. There is no such thing as
a closed system of knowledge. All knowledge is constituted
within the setting of history, never outside it. All new
knowledge springs from the decay of previous knowledge
which was itself once innovative. Knowledge is born when
one has the humility to accept that such knowledge will,
in its turn, decay. Sometimes certain scientists seem to
forget this.
Having said this, neither you nor I would want to con¬
fine children to the knowledge they had before they went
to school. On the contrary, we want pupils to learn to under¬
stand better what they already know, so that, in their turn,
they will become the creators of new knowledge.
M.C. Here we touch on a theme we are both familiar
withthat of the role of error in the pedagogical process.
The French epistemologist Gaston Bachelard suggested a
pedagogical system based on error, which involved seeing
mistakes not as the aberrations of a tired mind, but as an
## [Page 7](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/087663engo.pdf#page=7) 🆗
### 87648: Reading the world: Paulo Freire talks to Marcio D'Olne Campos
"epistemological obstacle", a barrier to the act of knowing
and a challenge to reality from the person faced with it.
Errors can thus be seen as "ideological obstacles" which deny
the existence of or block the way to the birth of new
knowledge.
P.F. Bachelard's concept of error should be democra¬
tized. If all educators regarded error not as in itself a bar¬
rier to understanding but as an obstacle of an ideological
nature, then error itself would become a necessary step in
the progress of knowledge.
Teachers should, by word and deed, show their pupils
that error is not the sign of a serious gap in their knowledge
or a proof of their incompetence, but, on the contrary, a
legitimate step in the learning process. Rather like someone
who looks first to his right for something that he will even¬
tually find on his left.
Once this inflection is given to the notion of error, the
whole pedagogical relationship is profoundly changed. Not
only does it ease the concept of learning for the child, it
also encourages the teacher to adopt a more modest approach
and relieves him of some of the burden of authority. Under
the authoritarian conception of error, error enables the
teacher to assert his power and to punish.
M.C. To punish in the classic meaning of the word.
P.F. In the strictly classic sensewrite out a hundred
times "I shall not make a mistake again"; to be kept in; to
be sent out of the room. This kind of thinking goes beyond
the intellectual plane. There is a danger that the pupil will
see error as a moral and cultural stain, as some kind of unfor¬
givable sin in some way linked to his or her social origins.
Far from being static, curiosity is perpetual, symbolic
movement. The curious mind cannot approach, grasp or
assimilate the object of its attention without feeling its way
or without making mistakes. When error is regarded as the
logical outcome of curiosity, it should never be punished.
Once this "error complex", this feeling of culpability,
has been eliminated, the knowledge that pupils bring with
them must be made an integral part of the dialogue that is
established between the class and the teacher. By its nature,
scientific rigour involves moments of complete spontaneity.
I would even go so far as to say that absolute rigour does
not exist, but co-exists with spontaneity and even arises from
it. Neither scientists nor teachers have the right to scorn
what is known as "popular wisdom" and even less to exclude
it so as to impose a supposedly rigorous explanation of the
world.
What we want is a pedagogical method, which, while
not rejecting the demands of rigour, gives scope to spon¬
taneity and emotion and adopts as its point of departure
what I might call the pupils' perceptual, historical and social
"here and now".
M.C. I would like here to refer to my experience of
"ethnoscience", which is the ethnography of knowledge as
seen through local group practices in the formulation of
knowledge and techniques. By definition, therefore, it is a
discipline devoid of any trace of ethnocentricity.
In order to understand the body of knowledge accumu¬
lated by a minority culture, it must be learned from the
inside. First one has to explore the vast network of words,
the world of basic notions that makes a link between man
and nature that is specific to that culture. How can this be
done? By adopting, from the start, the position of an appren¬
tice compiler of knowledge and playing the card of spon¬
taneity. As an educator I might also add, by accepting the
spontaneity of others, just as we accept our own. This means
sharing the child's culture within the classroom.

### 87648: Reading the world: Paulo Freire talks to Marcio D'Olne Campos
P.F. Yes, the ideal standpoint is acceptance of the spon¬
taneity of others.
M.C. In this way, I prepare myself for a real dialogue.
Coming to grips, without preconceptions, with a different
cultural context is the fundamental precondition of my work
as an ethnoscientist. I have to call upon all my ingenuity,
all my freshness of mind, if I am to understand the tools
of thought and action and the categories of thought that are
inherent in tribal societies. Only later, and very gradually,
is it possible to systematize.
This experience, and especially my work on the
knowledge of astronomy of the Indians of the island of
Búzios, in the Brazilian state of Sào Paulo, has had a great
influence on my work as an educator. I learned that what
you, Paulo, call the "minimal vocabulary" is much vaster
than the actual words that are used. The word is much more
than a sign; it is a symbolic, all-encompassing discourse. The
symbolical signification which impregnates the communi¬
cation of these groups of people with their world is as struc¬
tured as their language. Both come together in the
deciphering of the universe and the constitution of
knowledge into themes for reflection.
It is this vital relationship between nature and society,
a relationship which is the fount of culture, that we are
trying to comprehend in depth. Like the teacher, the scien¬
tific researcher must work in what might be called the
"laboratory of life". This is not to denigrate the scientific
facilities available to usbooks, laboratory research,
programme content, in short, all official knowledge. It is,
however, essential to put this official knowledge into per¬
spective, on the spot, to ensure that we do not inflict on
children abstract exercises dreamed up by people who are
insufficiently competent.
In our research, therefore, we have been obliged to give
pride of place, as our starting point, to notions of space and,
time which, in each case, provide a different framework and
colouring to our natural and cultural environment and thus
form the whole basis of our presence in the world. The ques¬
tions we put to the various disciplines,to the various reposi¬
tories of knowledge, are formulated in terms of the questions
this presence in the world asks of us. Both in the school
and in the field, this has led to a trans-disciplinary approach.
We move freely from one method of exploring knowledge
to another.
Thanks to this listening in to the world, we are able to
rediscover and verify our knowledge in another cultural
contextthe world of the pupil. We are making progress
not in our own knowledge, but in the knowledge of others.
P.F. Once again one must deplore the dirigiste
approach adopted by many educators. It is impossible to
comprehend intuitively the knowledge of the Indians you
have been talking about. First of all you must immerse your¬
self in the setting and conditions that have given rise to that
knowledge. This is what many intellectuals refuse to do.
Even when they expound progressive ideas, their practices
remain deeply authoritarian and their ideology remains
elitist. Although, perhaps, they would not admit it to them¬
selves, for them only institutionalized knowledge is true
knowledge. In fact, they see no value in popular wisdom,
which they consider to be imperfect, insignificant and not
worth talking about.
This reminds me of a rather revealing anecdote. It was
during a meeting at which the working methods of peasants
had been discussed. A group of intellectuals had just finished
a lengthy discussion, when a peasant got up to speak. "The
way things are going," he said, "I don't see any point in
continuing. We shall never reach agreement. You over
there"and with a humorous gesture he emphasized the
class distance that separated the two groups despite the fact
that they were in the same room"you over there are preoc¬
cupied with the salt, whereas for us what counts is the
sauce." The room fell silent. The intellectuals asked them¬
selves perplexedly what the peasant was getting at. His com¬
panions, on the other hand, knew exactly what he meant
and were waiting for a reply.
In his terse, simple language, the peasant was saying "The
discussion is going round in circles because you are looking
only at a fragment of reality whereas we see it as a whole.
We are thinking about things as a whole without stopping
to examine details, whereas you, who are always talking
about the overall picture, are getting bogged down in
details." Salt is only one ingredient in the sauce, but the sauce
symbolizes the sum of all the ingredients. This was a
metaphor that revealed an analytical capacity that certain
intellectuals did not expect to find in a peasant.
In my view, knowledge and competence are only of
valuealways relative, but nevertheless considerableif one
is aware that they are, like human beings, necessarily par¬
tial and imperfect.

PAULO FREIRÉ, of Brazil, is an internationally known educator. His
many works translated into English include Pedagogy of the Oppressed
(Herder & Herder, New York, 1970), Pedagogy in Progress: the Letters
to Guinea-Bissau (Seabury Press, New York, 1978), and 7fie Politics of
Education: Culture, Power and Liberation (Macmillan, Basingstoke, UK,
1985).
MARCIO D'OLNE CAMPOS is a Brazilian physicist with an interest in
ethnoscience, ethnoastronomy and education. He is the founder-
director of the Aldebaran observatory at the University of Campinas,
Säo Paulo state, Brazil.
M.C. The fact is that, from the moment when we think
of them in terms of movement and not as a definitive
achievement, all forms of knowledge and competence are,
as Piaget said, constantly brought into question. Everything
seems to indicate that the equilibrium we seek as we attempt
to construct our knowledge is doomed to be destroyed as
soon as it is achieved. If we accept the idea that knowledge
is an ongoing process, then we must always be ready to
retrace our steps. We accept this disequilibrium because we
know that it is the prerequisite of a new equilibrium.
This position is just as valid for the teacher as for his
relationship with others. This other being who speaks to
you from a marginal, minority culture that is quite different
from your own, is capable of introducing you to his or her
cultural context if only you are prepared to accept the dise¬
quilibrium. Return to a state of equilibrium is dependent
upon contact and dialogue and not upon a way of thinking
that will leave you isolated in your so-called competence.
For me, the key to literacy training lies in this kind of inten¬
sive, dynamic interaction.
P.F. What conclusion can we draw from all this? It
is the same for us all, whether we are Latin American school¬
children, students in Asia or university teachers in Europe
or America: friend, please never lose your capacity for
wonder and astonishment in the world which you regard
and in which you live.

,any thinkers have sought universally acceptable
principles of beauty and aesthetic value but their quarry has
proved elusive. "The trouble about beauty," Sir Ernst
Gombrich has written, "is that tastes and standards of what
is beautiful differ so much." The French poet Paul Valéry
gracefully side-stepped the issue when he said that the beautiful
is that which drives us to despair.
The modern world has largely abandoned this quest. Here as
in other fields the spirit of relativism has triumphed, swept away
authoritarian concepts, and frustrated attempts to reduce the
many forms of beauty to a single Ideal such as that sought by
the ancients. In some significant works of modern art the idea
of perfection, of "getting it right", has been rejected. The
onlooker is induced to feel that there is beauty in all things.
Paradoxically, beauty asserts its presence and its essential unity
through the very diversity and ubiquity of its manifestations.
Although it may escape intellectual analysis, it proclaims itself
to the senses. There may be no golden rule, but a sense of beauty
has always existed, fluctuating constantly in the human mind.

### 87649: The Eye of the beholder
THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER
Women from Myanmar
(formerly Burma).
VJOOD morning, may I ask you a
question?
Please do.
What exactly are the "canons of beauty"?
A canon is a criterion, a model or an ideal.
I believe the word comes from the name of
a statue by the ancient Greek sculptor Poly-
clitus, which Herodotus called the Canon
because of its ideal form.
So I'd be right in thinking that there are
such things as canons of beauty.
Yes, of course. But they vary.
How do you mean?
What the Greeks considered beautiful, the
Indians did not, and vice versa. In ancient
India, the finest compliment you could pay
a woman was to say that her thighs were like
those ofan elephant. That wouldn't be a very
flattering thing to say today.
Certainly not.
In classicalJapan, at the peak ofthe Heian
civilization in the eleventh century, elegant
aristocratic ladies painted their teeth black.
And what about those African women
who lengthen their necks?
And the Amazon Indians who stretch their
lower lips?
What beauty can they see in that, I
wonder.
To us, it's neither beautiful nor pleasant.
But it's one of their customs.
Yet it seems to me that we all know a
pretty woman when we see onetake film
stars, for instance.
JEAN-CLAUDE CARRIERE,
French author, dramatist and
scriptwriter, is director of
FEMIS, a cinema and
audiovisual school in Paris. He
has adapted the great Indian
epic the Mahabharata for the
stage and, for the screen,
Edmond Rostand's play Cyrano
de Bergerac. His publications
include "Conversation on the
Invisible" (1988), written in
collaboration with Jean
Audouze and Michel Cassé,
and "The Mahabharata"
(1989), both published by
Belfond, Paris.
You said pretty, not beautiful.
That's true.
Beauty, beauty, nobody really knows what
it means. Sorry to keep going on about India,
but in India a woman's beauty is thought of
primarily as an inner quality, the profound
andpersonal sign ofsomeone who has fulfilled
her life, her dharma. That's why people
hardly ever say that a woman is beautiful
until she's over fifty. When she's young, she
may be pretty or nice-looking or attractive,
but beauty comes later.
How complicated it all is!
Everything human is complicated. Ifyou
asked me to talk about simplicity, for
example, I wouldn't know how to begin.
Nothing could be less simple than simplicity.
Yet you often see a man or a woman or
a child and everybody says how beautiful
they are.
...or a cat, or a car...
But the fact is, everyone agrees.
In our society, perhaps, almost everyone
agrees. Beauty is a matter of consensus, you
see, a cultural phenomenon, an arbitrary and
mysterious convention in each society.
Nonsense! You can't be right! There must
be a universal concept of beauty! And ugli¬
ness! Some colours clash, some horses are

too thin, some dogs are too fat, some trees
are gnarled and bent, and...
Take it easy, of course you're right. Of
course there are people, of both sexes, who
seem to move around in an aura ofbeauty...
what Salvador Dalí would have called
Pythagorean beauty. But even here not
everyone might agree. ..not to mention dogs
and trees. Take the case of my father. He
couldn't stand fashion models. He thought
they had legs like rabbitsnot very attrac¬
tive animals in his opinion. But I don 't agree
with him at all.
You like rabbits?
/ like models. I love it when I see them
turning and pirouetting on the catwalk. It
makes me feel dizzy. I never look at the
dresses. How about you?
I don't often go to fashion shows.
Nor do I. But I watch them on television.
What about body-building, do you find
that beautiful?
Goodness, no!
My son thinks he's too skinny so he's
taken up weight lifting. It worries me.
It makes the veins stand out. It's horrible.
You've said it yourself: it's horrible.
I'd be the first to admit that we let our¬
selves be trapped by words. Ah, beauty! What
a complicated business it all is, especially
when we're not talking about people. You
mentioned horses and trees. What about
houses, landscapes, the thousand-and-one
utensils and objects we use each day? What
about the feelings works ofart inspire in us?
You might say that a cathedral is beautiful,
or a play by Beckett, or a Mozart symphony.
Or the sea, the sky, a meadow, or a soul. We
may find a sunset enchanting, but who knows
whether a Martian would? Who knows
whether a Martian would have the foggiest
idea about what we call beauty?
You look sad all of a sudden.
No wonder. It's quite impossible to define
what moves us. However hard we try we
never get to the bottom of it.
Maybe that's precisely why we are moved
by beautiful thingsbecause they can't be
defined, labelled and put into little boxes.
Remember what the witches say in Mac¬
beth: "Fair is foul, andfoul is fair..." Where
is all this getting us? It's enough to drive one
to despair!
Come on, pull yourself together. It's not
as bad as all that.
But it is!
I should never have asked you that ques¬
tion in the first place.
But it's a question I ask myself every day!
Harmony, beauty ... it's all too complicated
for us. It's an unfathomable mystery.
Everyone who's tried to establish criteria for
beauty has failed. It reminds me ofa stupid
remark made by a critic called Emile Bayard
around the turn of the century. This is what
he wrote: "Ifever we saw giraffes, elephants,
tigers and lions running around in our dear
old countryside, we should have to admit that
nature had no taste."
Incredible.
But true. It's always the same. We think
the world is imperfect, we want to improve
it at all costs, but we just can 't. That's what
gets me down. You're quite right.
Look at that woman walking past. That
one over there.... Do you think she's
beautiful?
Where?
Over there. That tall brunette, the one
wearing blue stockings.
Oh yes. Magnificent!
I think so too. So there we are. We agree.
Delighted to hear it! But I'm afraid I must
ask you to excuse me. I have to rush off. I've
got an appointment...
Of course. Don't let me keep you. Well
well ... are you going in the same direction
as she is?
Yes, I am.
Fancy that! So am I! What a coincidence!
Do you mind if we stroll along together?
Why not?
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Beautiful.

"/ am beautiful, o mortals, like a dream of stone"

"And my body, I know, is true eternity"
The ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead

### 87650: A Living eternity
A living eternity
BY AYYAM WASSEF
Xhe desert, place of all beginnings, should
perhaps be our point of departure. If we are to
glimpse the secret of those who built for eternity,
perhaps we should rediscover the desert as it was
before the pyramids were built. I am no historian
and I say "perhaps" to authorize myself to
imagine this legendary starting point, to visualize
the birth of ancient Egyptian art.
There are countries where this type of anal¬
ysis of aesthetic activity seems to conform to their
topography. Egypt is one of them. The land of
Egypt is,. basically, a tabula rasa on which the
course of the Nile, from south to north, and that
of the sun, from east to west, provide the co¬
ordinates of an ideal map, which already existed
before it was known to man. Geometry is not
the fruit of reasoning alone. Here shapes stand
out against the even planes of the desert, in the
pure, limpid light, with the precise beauty of a
definition. The timeless horizon is spanned by
the cyclical movement of the sun and cut by the
flowing river, a living constant between two
banks of eternity. In this land of constants, geom¬
etry is born of the ritual encounter of light and
space. Symbol of symbols, this hallowed
encounter spawns and reveals the very essence of
aesthetics. "O Ra whose rays created the eyes of
all living creatures..."
Dayr al-Bahrithe hallowed vision
The tall cliff face of the western mountain rises
up on the left bank of the Nile. The mountain
is an affirmation of all that the desert is not. The
timeless desert is a gaping, motionless immensity,
open to the winds. The slightest breeze fashions
landscapes or carves out pathways that are cons¬
tantly erased. The fluid chaotic sliding of the sand
acts as a form of self-suppression that is time itself
(or its absence, which amounts to the same thing).
Simultaneously encompassing past, present and
future, the desert is fully aware of the absolute
present of abstractions. The desert has no
memory, no history and is open to all eventuali¬
ties. It is the zero point of history, even the his¬
tory of the Earth itself.
In contrast, a mountain is solidity itself. A
mountain has a memory, conserving the furrows
gouged by the wind and accepting their suc¬
cessors. It is a monument, a record of history, a
cryptogram of time. A mountain can be visual¬
ized, but the desert always eludes our grasp. Like
any inert solid, a mountain can be imagined.
Unlike the desert, it is raw material waiting to
be given a shape. Who fashions these shapes? Not
the wind, which carves unwittingly, forming
shadows in the dark. To shape is to make visible.
The prime fashioner of shapes is the sun.
The eye of the sun is the first to look upon
the dark mountain. As the sunlight describes con¬
tours, it affords a host of viewpoints and of
unchanging images. As it lights up the mountain,
the sun gives a shape to the dark polymorphous
mass, and this first fashioning is indeed a "birth",
a "coming to light" which is akin to the process
whereby a notion comes to the mind of an artist.
Mimicking the sun, the eye creates the world
in all its beauty. The solar eye etches the dark
mountain with its rays and carves out its own
temple. Dayr al-Bahri, the funerary temple of
Queen Hatshepsut at Thebes, is carved out of the
western mountain just as the mountain itself was
carved out of darkness. A pastiche of the natural
art of the architect-sun, it reveals the laws
governing its own creation and the process by
which the eye brings a whole world to light. The
temple hallows the solar metaphor of the eye as
the sculptor of the world. We are at the begin¬
ning, the moment when time becomes time; the
creative act is not a part of the historical1 process;
it marks a new beginning. The temple of Dayr
al-Bahri is a temple fashioned by the creator's eye.
Its beauty, breaking away from the eternity of
the desert, makes history possible. What we refer
to as the "dark mists of time" precede the enlight¬
ening, creative irruption of the eye's vision. This
is what the temple of Dayr al-Bahri has captured
for ever in stonethe beauty of the world at its
birth.
The bas-reliefs of memory
Although the creative act inaugurates time, it also
inscribes its own history therein. The walls,
ceilings and columns of Egyptian temples are
covered with carvings portraying rituals, liturgies
and scenes of war. On the porticoes of Hat-
shepsut's funerary temple, bas-relief carvings
depict the divine birth of the Queen, the naval
expedition to the land of Punt (the Somali coast),

and record for eternity the glory of the sovereign.
So subtle is the delineation that it seems more
like drawing than sculpture. The sculptors fol¬
lowed the pattern set by the wind, the outer walls
of monuments are hollowed out while those
inside are raised. They carved out the background
of the scene so that the details of each figure
are revealed by the slightest of surface variations.
The sculptor's hand informs the stone, engraving
in it a memory destined to last throughout
eternity.
This is why each artist respected the famous
"conventions", or rituals of his craft, the first of
which was the law of ideal proportion. Any per¬
sonal innovation would destroy the permanence
sought. Whereas the carvings made by the wind
on the mountainside can be modified by other
winds, the artist tames erosion, takes command of
the wind and imposes his law upon it. By per¬
petuating the sculptor's act, technique confers
stability.
Thus the exploits of a specific monarch,
recounted in accordance with superhuman rules,
escape the realm of history and are inscribed in
eternity. Everything is portrayed in accordance
with conventions whose disdain for perspective
demonstrates that beauty is not a personal reve¬
lation. The viewpoint is that of the sun, the vision
of the ultimate eye, beside which any subjective
vision is an illusion, if not a misconception. In
the incorruptibility of matter, in the unity of a
form, "man has become Man" and has joined the
immortal gods.
The art of the fresco-
eternity in rhythm
"Nothing in art, not even movement, should
appear accidental". This remark by Degas, which
he used to describe his own technique for con¬
veying the ethereal grace of a dancer in the immo
bility of a drawing, applies with uncanny
accuracy to the frescoes of ancient Egypt. Degas
also portrayed figures in profile yet looking out
of the picture, sometimes in scenes painted from
the wings and sometimes when he brilliantly jux¬
taposed figures in movement and repose.
Critics have long commented on the static
quality of Egyptian art and denounced its
"strange blindness". But it is precisely through
tireless repetition of the same outline that purity
of line can be achieved. Symbolic painting cap¬
tures the essence of the dancer's movement, the
epitome of all movement. Think of the rigorous
training of dancers, their obstinate repetition of
each movement until it becomes exaggerated. In
performing her dance, a dancer must free herself
from her body and reach abstraction, the very

heart of the dance, its truth. The dancer can thus
be seen as an incarnation of drawing. Egyptian
painting is full of dancers and dances, from the
sacred, ritual dances performed in homage to the
goddess Hathor to the secular dances that are por¬
trayed in banqueting scenes. We see the dancers,
agile magicians, moving in eternity.
Three dancers are shown cunningly inter¬
laced, as though snapped by a camera at different
stages of a single movement. They perform
pirouettes, leg lifts, and the acrobatic "wheel"
the feathery lightness of the outline indicating
that the movement is incomplete. The same
method is used to portray processions, with
individual members of the crowd depicted in suc¬
cessive poses indicating forward movement. We
hear the rhythm of their step, just as we hear the
unceasing lament of the mourners in the slow
motion expression of their collective grief.
Beauty is present, then, in a living eternity.
Far from being motionless in time, it oscillates
between what has been and what is to come. This
is the rhythmic beat of a masterpiece, looking
towards its future interpretations, for beauty car¬
ries on an "invincible dialogue" with time.

Hatshepsut, Thutmose III defiled her memory,
breaking statues and hammering out her name.
Yet for us these mutilated faces are still works
of art. The mutilations of some of them have
proved fortunate in the sense that they struck a
chord among admirers of a later age. Time revives
beauty, and beauty senses this and glows at this
hoped-for encounter. A work of art originates a
dream which it is our business to perpetuate; its
endless journey in time is helped along by a
procession of constantly changing onlookers.
The glorious destiny of the unfinished head
of Nefertiti in the Cairo Museum is perhaps an
illustration of this regenerating dialogue. With its
barely outlined features and painted lips, it calls
for an unending process of interpretation. Beauty
is already there, but the unfinished state informs
us that there is yet more to come.
However, the fascination that this sublime
sketch, perhaps no more than a sculptor's trial
run, holds for us today probably owes even more
to its unfinished state than to the fame of Queen
Nefertiti. She is "sublime" since we see in her
our own modernity. It is tempting to reply,
paraphrasing Schoenberg, that she is not modern,
she is simply unfinished. But incompleteness is
the order of the day. The proof of this is that the
unfinished head has finally eclipsed the com¬
pleted, fully-painted portrait bust of Nefertiti in
the Berlin Museum. Is it over-done? In this per¬
fectly finished head, the unexpected angle formed
by the dip of the vast head-dress and the queen's
graceful neck bears witness to an artistic mastery
which is itself divine. But let the divine hold its
peace; silence can be more eloquent than words.
There are negative forms of aesthetics in which
beauty is remarkable by its absence. It is not sur¬
prising that the unfinished head of Nefertiti
should become the idol of moderns who prefer
writing to what is written and fragments to
poems.
When the enigma of the beginning, of the
primordial birth, has been solved, it would seem
that to live again in a new era is simply to repeat
in new deserts the rite of commencement. The
faces of Egyptian statuary smile at this children's
game of making, unmaking, remaking time,
which, after all, simply means coming to terms
with time itself.
There is nothing particularly Egyptian in
wanting to overcome the harsh transitoriness of
existence and to pursue in the permanence of cre¬
ation the impossible dream of immortality. This
may be an heroic struggle, but it is no less banal
for that. What is less banal is, in the desperate
search for the most suitable means of greeting the
eternal, to have penetrated to the essential nature
of things. The greatest achievement of all, in
seeking the guidelines that deliver one from death,
is to have found the secret of perpetual life to
have known how to create forms that will be
capable, thousands of years later, of engendering
new meaning. 1

iHE opening sequence of a remarkable Korean
film, "Why has Bodhi Dharma gone East?",
shows a red light flashing on and off at regular
intervals in the corner of the screen. As it punc¬
tuates the moving images in a kind of visual coun¬
terpoint, it calls to mind the aesthetic canon that
governs the cinema, the art of moving light. In
the final images of the film, a liberated bird flies
up into the early morning sky like a star, while
on the earth below a man and his cow walk
together in harmony.
"Bodhi Dharma", with its flickering light of
water, fire and colour, with its sound and silence,
is a film that conjures up the beauty and wisdom
of the East, where emotion is a pure, immediate
response which is made spontaneously without
any prompting from the intellect. In this way
beauty blossoms in the universe. In skilful hands
the camera can capture and reveal the inner laws
of the invisible world. When it does so, there is
a moment of liberation at which we witness a
pure act. Such a moment occurs in "Bodhi
Dharma" in a scene when an orphan child enters
a temple and takes over the room of a newly
"departed" master.
The great Bengali director Satyajit Ray has
described how he and his fellow students at the
Visva-Bharata university founded by Rabin-
dranath Tagore at Santiniketan in India were
taught to draw a tree by making strokes from the
base upwards, in a movement which is in keeping
with the process of organic growth. At the same
time they were asked to "Consider Fujiyama...
fire within and calm without.. .the symbol of the
true Oriental artist". This Oriental canon of
beauty, which is so essential for the understanding
of the roots of creation and art, is also valid for
a medium such as Western cinema which uses
refined technology.
The soul of stardom
One of the great pioneers and masters of the art
of cinema, the American director D.W. Griffith,
believed that the sense of beauty is developed by
environment. "If I had children," he said, "I
should try to develop in them the sense of beauty.
To do this, I should provide them with rooms
of such simple beauty as that in which my father's
orotund voice poured forth the music of Keats 19

and Tennyson and Shakespeare." Griffith con¬
tinued his evocation of a setting in which beauty
could blossom thus: "we see the truth in silence.
Silence can be more eloquent than all the tongues
of men...." Describing the qualities he sought in
a film star, he wrote: "...Granted that the person
has a face for the movie camera, a face that pho¬
tographs wellthe first thing needed is soul."
Lillian Gish, one of Griffith's most famous
discoveries, possessed this quality to an out¬
standing degree. She had already become a legend
when she was in her early twenties and received
the accolade of stardoma portrait bust by the
fashionable sculptor Boris Loski. In Griffith's
film Broken Blossoms (1919) she made an unfor¬
gettably radiant appearance, her blonde hair sil¬
houetted against a halo of light. In all her screen
appearances she revealed a natural gift for radi¬
ating an inner light.
In the prologue to the silent epic Ben-Hur,
made in Hollywood in 1926, the Virgin Mary was
shown against a halo of backlight using the
biochrome process, while the main story was
filmed in black and white. This notion of colour
emanating from pure white light is a remarkable
example of cinematographic language and was
used much later in many memorable films to
depict beauty in glorious hues. However, despite
technological progress in the use of colour, eco¬
nomic pressures forced film-makers to continue
using black and white, but many directors used
this technique so brilliantly that it was as vibrant
as colour.
'The human face...
a land one can never tire
of exploring'
The play of light and shade on the human face
was exploited with great artistry in such films as
Carl Theodore Dreyer's The Passion ofJoan of
Arc, made in 1928 towards the end of the silent
era. The crystal clarity of Dreyer's stylization
made even silence vibrate. "Nothing in the
world," he said, "can be compared to the human
face. It is a land one can never tire of exploring.
There is no greater experience in a studio than
to witness the expression of a sensitive face under
the mysterious power of inspiration, to see it ani¬
mated from within and turning into poetry."
Hollywood was as sensitive as a celluloid
negative to light and its mysteries. One of the
great early directors, Josef von Sternberg, wrote
that "Light means fire and heat and life.... Every
subject has a moment when light can force its
beauty into full power, and that brings us to the
province of the artist.... Every light has a point
where it is brightest."
Marlene Dietrich is the star who was most
sensitive to Sternberg's use of light. She could feel
on her skin the exact temperature needed to cap¬
ture the luminosity of her beauty on film, and
always used her finger as a meter to test the inten¬
sity of the lighting.
Light flickering from a fireplace inspired
lighting director and cameraman William Daniels
in Rouben Mamoulian's film Queen Christina
(1933), which starred Greto Garbo and John Gil¬
bert. A special lens was developed which was used
to make a long tracking shot, culminating in an
enigmatic close-up of Garbo's face. The beauty
and composition of this sequence make it a land¬
mark in the history and mythology of the
cinema.
Fragile beauty
Hollywood jealously guarded from the public its
techniques for creating the illusion of beauty. For
the stars to retain their beauty and mystery was
a demanding responsibility, and as the years went
by and time left its marks very few of them

continued to face the cruel eye of the camera.
Only rarely did inner and outer beauty meet suc¬
cessfully on the screen after the bloom of youth
had faded.
One of the few celebrated exceptions was
Katharine Hepburn, who first appeared on the
scene as a young girl with freckles and wearing
tennis shoes. Rouben Mamoulian, who directed
her first professional performance as a maid in
Turgenev's A Month in the Country, remembered:
"She had only three replies in the play.... There
was something about herit's very difficult to
describe in words. You can't describe music.
There wasisa kind of luminosity. ..there are
some faces that project the light: hers does."
Hollywood immediately recognized in Hep¬
burn that mysterious aura which is the emana¬
tion of an inner light. Because she had this
quality, she was a natural choice to appear in
RKO Studio's historic Technicolor tests for St.
Joan in 1934. The only star who has been awarded
four Oscars for her performances on the silver
screen, Katharine Hepburn is one of those rare
photogenic actresses with a "soul".
In time the glory of these beautiful faces
which created the poetic canons of the cinema
began to disappear from the screen. Film-makers
began to use lighting that was harsh, crude and
direct. However, two Soviet directors have
revived the forgotten canons of traditional
Oriental art and opened up new ways of depicting
beauty.
The first of them, Andrei Tarkovsky,
introduced the aesthetics of icon painting in his
film about the life of the Russian painter Andrei
Rublev. After taking us on a long guided journey
through striking black and white images, the
vibrant notes of a bell sound as he reveals, in full
colour, fragments of Rublev's masterpiece, The
Old Testament Trinity.
The second director, Serguei Paradjanov,
returned to the techniques of silent cinema when
he used an almost static camera in his film about
the life of an eighteenth-century bard in the Cau¬
casian mountains, Sayat NovaColour of
Pomegranates, which is structured according to
the canons of Oriental music. Meticulously com¬
posed and edited soundtrack and images take us
back to a precise time and place, where from the
mouths of silver-haired children holding sacred
objects, we hear angelic, crystal-clear voices
singing Pity Us, Lord, one of the most ancient and
beautiful canticles.

Chinese painting The sound of silence

AND NAHAL TADJADOD
'T
Opposite page, White and

American painter and
photographer Man Ray
(1890-1976).
This page, Dreaming of
Immortality In a Thatched
Cottage, detail of a hand
scroll by the Chinese painter
T'áng Yin (1470-1523).
lHERE are painted landscapes that can be
passed through or contemplated; others in which
one can walk around; and yet others where one
would like to stay or live. All these landscapes
attain a degree of excellence. However, those in
which one would like to live are superior to the
others." Such was the view expressed by Kuo Hsi,
a great landscape painter of the Song dynasty who
lived in the eleventh century.
The painters of ancient China dreamt of a
total communion between man and nature. Inas¬
much as it partook of the mystery of creation,
painting was considered to be an almost godlike
activity. Underlying the practice of art, and
indeed all Chinese aesthetic thought, was a
philosophical vision based on the concept of the
Void (that is, empty incipience).
The idea of the Void was already present in
that seminal work of Chinese culture, the "Book
of Changes" (I Chmg). The philosophers who
made it a central part of their doctrine were those
of the Taoist school, the two founders of which,
Lao-tzu and Chuang-tzu,* exercised an unfailing
influence on most art critics.
To the Chinese mind the Void was not some¬
thing vague or non-existent but a highly dynamic
and essential dimension of human life and of the
life of the universe. Characterized by the perfect
balance of the breath of life and of the Yin-Yang
duality, at the heart of the interactions by which
all things are governed, it was regarded as a space
in which true plenitude could be achieved. It was
through the Void that human beings could arrive
at an all-embracing view of the universe. For this
reason, in classical China the idea of the Void
provided a key to mastering the noblest pursuits,
ranging from the various forms of art to medicine
or warfare.
'Straw sandals visits
Son of Heaven'
In music, for instance, the Void is expressed by
certain syncopated rhythms that punctuate the
silences. Breaking the line of development, the
silence creates a space through which the sounds
can reach beyond themselves and attain a kind
of resonance that outreaches resonance.
In poetry, one way of introducing the Void
is to miss out certain grammatical links, known
as "empty words". The linear, temporal progres¬
sion of language is thus severed by the poet for
the sake of an open-ended reciprocal relationship
between the subject and the objective world. No
longer is there any distinction between the inner
world and the outer world. A kind of direct com¬
munion with things is thus established, as though
the heart were speaking through them. .
One day Tu Fu (712-770), a famous poet of
the Tang period (seventh-tenth centuries),
appeared in rags before the emperor in exile. To
point up the contrast between his pitiful state and

the solemnity of the occasion, he left out the per¬
sonal pronouns in the poem he then composed,
declaring simply, not without a touch of irony,
"Straw sandals visits Son of Heaven".
In a poem describing a farewell scene, Li Po
(701-762), another famous poet of the Tang
period, deliberately omits the words normally
used to introduce a comparison: "Floating cloud
peregrine mood/Setting sun spurned heart". He
thereby "organically" links together human life
and the world of nature, which does not serve
as an external setting but forms an intrinsic part
of the drama.
Those who have the dimension of emptiness
within them efface the distance separating them
from the outside world. The subject becomes at
one and the same time absent and profoundly
present. This fragmented language in which the
Void is a driving force leaves room for the move¬
ments of the breath of life and thereby suggests
the unsayable.
'By means of a slender brush,
recreate the Void'
It is in painting however that the Void is given
the most striking expression. In some paintings
dating from the time of the Song and Yuan
dynasties (tenth-fourteenth centuries), when
Chinese painting was at its zenith, as much as
two-thirds of the picture may be given over to
the Void or, in other words, left unpainted. Emp¬
tiness is not an inert presence but is felt, on the
contrary, to be charged with a vibrancy that links
the visible world to an invisible world.
Even within the visible world (the painted
area) the Void is still present. Thus between the
mountain and the water, which are the two poles,
the cloud represents the intermediate Void. The
painter creates the impression that the mountain
can be transformed into waves and, conversely,
that the water can rise up in the form of a moun¬
tain. Both cease to be regarded as partial,
opposing, unchanging elements; they embody the
dynamic principle of reality as a whole.
By upsetting all linear perspective, the Void
reveals this ever-present interaction between man
and nature within the painting, on the one hand,
and between the person looking at the painting
and the painting itself on the other. The painting
is thus meant to be "listened to" even more than
to be seen. Producing a painting, or contem¬
plating one, becomes an act of participation, a
form of meditation in which reality is eased out
by truth.
In this sense, painting in China is a
philosophy in action, a sacred activity whose pur¬
pose is human fulfilment. Far from being seen

### 87652: The Sound of silence: Chinese painting
as no more than an aesthetic object, a painting
tends to recreate an "open" space where real living
becomes possible. In the words of the poet and
painter Wang Wei (699-759), "By means of a
slender brush, recreate the immense body of the
Void".
For Chinese painters, the brushstroke truly
represents the process whereby man partakes of

brushstroke has been aided by the existence of
calligraphy and by the instantaneous and rhyth¬
mical execution of a painting, following a long
period of study and rapt attention. Before taking
up his brush, the painter must have achieved a
mastery of the many types of brushstroke
representing the many types of beings or things,
with each brushstroke being the result of close
observation of nature.
"Before you can paint a bamboo," wrote Su
Dongpo (1036-1101), "the bamboo must have
grown deep inside you. It is then that, brush in
hand, gazing intently, you will see the vision rise
up before you. Capture the vision at once by the
strokes of your brush, for it may vanish as sud¬
denly as a hare at the approach of the hunter."
The opposing link that unites the different
natural phenomenamountain and water, trees
and rocks, animals and plantsis expressed
through the Void, and it is thus that the painter
succeeds in recreating the pulsations of an
invisible world at the heart of the seen world.
Only then can each being enter into communion
with all things. Does not legend have it that Wu
Tao-tzu (701-792) disappeared into the mist of a
landscape that he had just painted?
The completed painting, once rolled up,
becomes a universe in itself. Unrolling it (in
China, unrolling and gazing upon a masterpiece,
hour after hour, is an almost sacred ritual), means
each time translating experiential time into a
living space. The Void recreates in the heart of
the beholder the visual music of the universe.

T may well be, in the final analysis, that art is
essentially a means of reconciling the world of
forms that surrounds us with our perception of
these forms. In this sense, art carries us beyond
the kind of cognition that we require for
everyday life by providing opportunities to
accede to heightened levels of perception and
experience.
If this definition of art is correct, then we can
perhaps go further to state that in essence, artistic
creativity involves the act of opening doors to a
level of knowledge and experience that transcends
our surface perception of the world around us.
It is as if we spent most of our lives groping
through a forest of dark objects, which are sud¬
denly illuminated from time to time by the light
that is thrown by works of art, or as if the forms
and sounds that we are accustomed to in everyday
life acquired new depths and dimensions through
the transformation of our cognitive abilities by
the process of creating or perceiving art.
What doors do African works of art open for
us, and how do such doors function? Although
there is no single form of art that can be defined
as "African art", there are a number of styles and
approaches which flow from the creative genius
of the peoples of Africa, and which, taken col¬
lectively, can be seen to belong to the same family
of art. To understand the function of African art,
let us take the mask as an example.
Power objects
Where does art end and religion begin? In Africa,
masks are not mere carvings. They are "power
objects", in the sense that they are a means of
access to an invisible world inhabited by the
divinities, spirits and ghosts which are held in
African cosmogony to share the universe with
mankind.
Just as many peoples in other parts of the
world have developed a religious iconography to
represent the divine, Africans use masks in the
course of religious rituals and ceremonies to estab¬
lish communication between human beings and
the spiritual world, which 'is imperceptible
through normal means of cognition. It is impos¬
sible to understand the stylistic conventions of
carved African masks unless we keep their pur¬
pose in mind.
First of all, African masks are not intended
to mirror real forms. They are designed to reflect
the essence of what they stand for. A mask is not
a reproduction of an object, but a sign that stands
in lieu of the invisible. Since it is a sign, the artist
may encapsulate in his carving the attributes of
the spirit-object that he has set out to represent,
## [Page 27](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/087663engo.pdf#page=27) 🆗
### 87653: African masks: keys to the spirit world
or simply give free reign to his imagination in
order to capture the idea of the divinity or spirit
that is to manifest itself through the mask. Either
way, his task is to achieve a kind of abstraction
that stands in lieu of an outward form.
At the same time, the mask is a face through
which the divinity or the spirit who temporarily
inhabits the body of the masquerader looks out
on the world. In this face, shapes and forms are
often expressed as geometrical relationships. Why
should the eyes of the divinity not be triangles
that stand in a balanced relationship to a cube that
stands for a mouth? Or why should the mask
itself not be surmounted by other forms that
extend skywards in intricate spirals? And for that
matter, why should the face not sit on top of the
head, gazing forever skywards, or be replaced by
the graceful sweep of a sleek form that represents
the spirit of the antelope? Why should the artist's
conceptual freedom be limited?
Free expression
Sometimes the mask tells a story, like the Yoruba
gelede (a secret society) mask that may have sit¬
ting atop its helmet-like form a football player
with a ball at his feet, or an aeroplane that once
caught the eye of the sculptor. Why not? The
mask is after all a window into a dream-like world
in which many strange things exist side by side.
It leads us into the sculptor's imagination, as well
as into the age-old artistic and cultural traditions
that guide his creativity.
Even though the artistic and cultural heritage
from which his work flows is generally well
defined, the African mask carver enjoys almost
unlimited creative freedom. Even where he seeks
to reproduce a pre-existing model that has been
enshrined by tradition as the perfect representa¬
tion of a spirit form, he is still at liberty to add
his own variations and flourishes.
But is this art? Where is beauty to be found
in the strange world of abstract forms and signs
that is so characteristic of African masks? Tradi¬
tionally, the African artist is obsessed by the
rhythm, balance and harmony of forms. On
examining a mask closely, one cannot help being
stfuck by the care and thought that has gone into
ensuring that volumes and shapes are
symmetricalwhen they are not deliberately
made to confront each other in patterns contrived
to produce a visual shock.
The same conceptual freedom that traditional
African sculptors achieve in masks is also found
in carvings of decorative or ritual objects. In some
sculptures, however, such as the famous bronzes
of Ife and Benin, the purpose of the work of art
is to provide a faithful reproduction of the forms
that surround us. Here art sublimates life in its
own way...
Beauty in art is not necessarily dependent on
a faithful imitation of nature, an approach that
the world has absorbed through exposure to
African art. 27

Araditional Indian art is primarily religious.
Everything in it has a divine meaning and no
aspect of life is treated for its own sake. People,
trees, flowers, birds and other features of the
natural world are all depicted in painting and
sculpture, but their beauty is not intrinsic, it lies in
the divine idea which is impressed on those human
minds which are in a suitably receptive state.
The earliest Indian treatise on the theory of
the beautiful is the Natya Shastra, which was
written around the sixth century BC. In it the
sage-priest Bharata set forth the important con¬
cept of aesthetic flavour or rasa. In a famous pas¬
sage, Bharata says that a rasa is a strong and lasting
emotion which may be kindled by transitory
feelings of pleasure and pain. He describes the
main rasas which are aroused by the arts as erotic,
comic, pathetic, furious, heroic, terrible, odious,
and marvellous.
To taste rasa the spectator must be in that
state of freedom which comes from detachment
from the self. His or her mind must be in a pure
and balanced state (satiric). Egoism and desire
must be forsaken before vision and delight are
possible. Through glimpsing a divine vision, the
real nature of the soul is set free. Unlike the
katharsis of Greek tragedy, rasa does not involve
the idea of emotional relief alone. The spectator
does not experience the unpleasant or agreeable
effects of his or her reactions but resolves them
into a blissful state of consciousness.
While the ultimate aesthetic consciousness is
purely contemplative, the steps prescribed to
achieve it through the artistic process are marked
by a high degree of concentration and purity of
mind. Aesthetic activity is like a yoga, a seeking
of truth, a spiritual exercise involving the culti
vation of a disinterested feeling. The emotions
aroused by a work of art do not belong to any
one person, neither to artist, actor or spectator.
They have no location in time and space. As
Ananda Coomaraswamy has pointed out, "all
knowledge and all truth are absolute and infinite,
waiting not to be created, but to be found".
When depicting the gods, Indian sculptors
and painters did not use the Hellenic models
whereby the gods are imagined in human form.
They sought to attain their goal through concep¬
tual insight or intuition rather than by observa¬
tion and analysis of physical features. A deity
symbolically represents a unified set of spiritual
ideas and his body, therefore, should be regarded
as merely a vehicle for the eternal expression of
that particular set of spiritual ideas. Thus the
many-headed gods and many-armed goddesses of
Hindu art represent eternal abstract ideas of
beauty and have no exact counterparts in nature.
One ideal of the divine form is based on the
ancient notion of the Indian hero, the superman.
The Mahabharata describes this ideal form as that
of a mighty hunter who became invincible after
vanquishing the king of beasts in many conflicts
and acquired a lion-like body with broad chest
and shoulders, long, massive arms, a thick neck,
and a very slim waist. In Indian art this leonine
body became the symbol of physical strength.
Nimbleness, another essential quality for success
in the chase, was symbolized by legs like those

of a deer or a gazelle, a feature which is promi¬
nent in the Buddhist cave-paintings at Ajanta in
northern India and in the Buddhist sculptures at
Amaravati.
In both Hindu and Buddhist art, gods who
had acquired divine powers by ascetic practices
are not represented like human ascetics with
bodies emaciated by hunger and thirst, with pro¬
truding bones and swollen veins. Instead they are
portrayed with smooth skin and rounded limbs.
Their veins and bones are always concealed, they
have strong necks, massive shoulders and narrow
waists. Whereas the divinities of the Far East
appear to dwell in a fair garden of peace filled
with delicate springtime blossoms, the Indian
ideal of beauty seems to be set among the celes¬
tial solitudes of a Himalayan skyscape hinting at
the infinite.
A special feature of the Indian concept of the
beautiful is based on the distinction between
pleasure and bliss (ananda), which is stated in the
Bhagavad Gita as being at the core of beauty.
Pleasure is selfish and individual, phenomenal and
relative, whereas bliss is absolute and infinite.
Pleasure is transitory, but bliss is unalloyed and
related to composure and peace. The Ramayana
and the Mahabharata do not end with the van¬
quishing of the unrighteous and the victory of
the righteous. They move on towards the fulfil¬
ment of a life after life. The goal is not the attain¬
ment of an earthly throne but the attainment of
perfection. Sensuality and spirituality seem to be
merely the inner and outer aspects of the same
life. The Ajanta paintings enchantingly depict a
civilization in which the conflict of matter and
spirit has been beautifully resolved.

The Greek ideal

BC) found at Piraeus In 1959.

Xhe human figure occupies a central place in
Greek art and particularly in Greek sculpture. In
the earliest works a diversity of beasts and mon¬
sters are depicted, but the range soon narrows to
a few domestic animals such as dogs and horsesa
trend reflecting the anthropocentrism of Greek
thought, history and character.
The Greeks believed profoundly in the value
of man. This conviction underlies Aristotle's
statement that the city-state is the ideal political
institution. For Plato "Man participates in the
divine" and is "related to the gods". The great
lyric poet Pindar wrote that "Gods and men have
a single mother, only our strengths are different".
At the dawn of Greek civilization Homer sang
of a world where the gods not only mingled with
men butexcept that they were immortal and all-
powerfulfelt and behaved like them.
The gods are thus almost always represented
in human form. The human body is a constantly
recurring motif in Greek art. Soaring temple
columns with their finely-chiselled lines recall the
slender bodies of Greek youths, and the name for
the capital of a column (kionokranon) means head.
In paintings and sculptured reliefs the beauty of
the human form in repose or in action stands out
against a neutral background. Only later, during
the Hellenistic period, do we find some rather
clumsy attempts to represent man in a natural
setting.
Human and divine
This anthropomorphism explains the pre¬
eminence of sculpture, which can render the
beauty of the human body more successfully than
any other art form. In Plato's Republic, when the
philosopher Glaucon refers to Socrates' descrip¬
tion of the magistrates in his ideal city, he utters
this revealing phrase: "My dear Socrates, you
have made your magistrates too beautiful, just as
if you were a sculptor."
Only by representing in a purely human
form the men they honoured, the gods they wor
shipped and the heroes of their legends could the
ancient Greeks understand them and communi¬
cate with them, almost as equals.
When, around the middle of the seventh cen¬
tury BC, sculptors first dared to carve stone
statues that were life-size or larger, they initially
restricted themselves to a small number of human
types, always viewed from the front. These types
are the kouros or young man, naked and standing
upright, his arms held close to his sides and his
left leg slightly forward; the kore, a young woman
who is always depicted clothed, her feet together;
and the male or female figure seated in a hieratic
posture.
All of these types, particularly the kouroi,
have points in common with Egyptian statues of
gods and pharaohs, but there are some notable
differences. The kouros, unlike his Egyptian pro¬
totypes, is never portrayed wearing a garment
around his waist or leaning against a pillar, and
his legs are not attached by a support. The figure
is usually naked, like the Greek athlete on which
it is modelled. It seems to be on the verge of
movement or action, unlike Egyptian figures
which seem fixed for all eternity.
Despite their reserved attitude and their
modest demeanour, the faces of the korai express
great vitality. Many of them are shown smiling

sensually. Their clothing is beautifully draped and
painted. They exude the joy of life and the radiant
charm of youth. Other human figures carved on
votive and even funerary monuments have the
same vitality.
The canon of beauty
How did Greek sculptors succeed in rendering
this ideal, these figures in the full bloom of youth?
Above all through the science of proportions
which, until the beginning of the Middle Ages,
was considered to be the key to beauty. A detailed
description of its principles was given in the fifth

tise on his statue the "Doryphorus" (Spearbearer)
which was known as the "Canon" because it

embodied the ideal proportions of the male form.
Although what he says is not always clear, Poly¬
clitus created a system of fixed ratios between the
different parts of the body which was taken as
a model for several centuries.
But the use of mathematical proportions in
Greek sculpture must date back to much earlier
times, probably even earlier than Pythagoras
(second half of the sixth century BC) whose doc¬
trines had a great influence on architecture and
sculpture as well as on philosophy and political
thought. How could monumental sculpture have
come into being without the use of an elaborate
system of measurement?
The Greeks used Egyptian parameters to
create their large stone statues but, always eager
to break new ground, they soon began to make
their own rules and their own, more realistic,
types of figure. Does this mean that naturalism
was always a feature of Greek sculpture? Most
later theorists, notably Aristotle, have insisted
that art imitates nature. But did the word "imi-

tation" mean to the Greeks "a copy from nature"
as it does to us? And if it did, when did their con¬
cern for naturalism begin and how important
is it?
The aim of Greek sculptors, especially during
the archaic or pre-classical period, was not to
recreate the appearance of nature, but to bring
to the surface the very essence of the model and
above all to render it dynamically, so that it seems
to live. It might be said that the Greek sculptor
worked from the inside out. He brought to light
the masses of the body as though he himself were
creating life, rendering in every detail the har¬
mony of forms. Even during the most naturalistic
periods sculptors never attempted to produce
photographic likenesses, as in academic art, or
cold reflections of abstract forms, as in neo-
classicism. Their works vibrate with life which
is tempered only by a profound sense of balance
and moderation.
This passion for truth led to a constant
renewal of means of expression. At the beginning
of the fifth century BC there were two major
developments. A new pose, the contrapposto,
appeared. There was also a change in expressivity.
The indistinctly human and divine creatures that
had been depicted until then now seemed to
acquire a specifically human soul.
In contrapposto the weight of the figure is
shifted onto one leg, and the other is bent at the
knee. The figure stands at ease, with new supple¬
ness and freedom. The head is turned, the axes
change position, and the rhythms vary. Breaking
out of its solitude, the statue begins to relate to
the space around it.
The smile of the archaic period, with its
promise of eternal youth, gives way to a more
thoughtful expression. The statue looks inward,
addressing its own self and its creator. What it
loses in divine perfection, it gains in depth of
spiritual meaning and humanity. It is no coinci¬
dence that this new departure, which marks the
beginning of the classical style, took place in the
years when the art of Greek tragedy reached its
zenith. In the fourth century BC, this develop¬
ment culminated in the individualized portrayal
of the human figure.
The Apollonian and the Dionysian
This increasing concentration on appearance, this
fragmentation of truth, was ill received by some
artists and philosophers. Though Plato was
doubtless less hostile to the plastic arts than some
writers have claimed, it is true that he severely
criticized the aesthetics of his time. He believed
that beauty lies not in the deceptive and illusory
appearance that gives pleasure to the eye but in
a higher reality, which he called the Idea. He
approved only of geometrical forms, pure
volumes, and mathematical proportions. He
seems to have accepted only works of very
ancient Greek and Egyptian art, which he valued
for their purity of form and their immutability.
## [Page 33](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/087663engo.pdf#page=33) 🆗
### 87656: The Greek ideal
Closer to reality and to the Greek tradition,
Aristotle in the fourth century BC found beauty
in ideal proportions, symmetry and order. Art
for him was merely an imitation of nature; the
instinct for imitation being inherent in man.
Faithful to the naturalistic ideas of his time,
Aristotle remarked that a work of art is a source
of pleasure when we recognize in it a familiar
object, even if the object is not beautiful in reality.
In this he prefigured the modern notion that
there is a distinction between artistic beauty and
physical beauty.
What then did the Greeks understand by
artistic beauty? Was it the mathematical rules and
relations of number which for centuries imposed
simple, clear and symmetrical forms and har¬
monious proportions, as demanded by Polyclitus,
the most normative of sculptors, and Plato, the
most brilliant of philosophers? Or what
Nietzsche called the Apollonian? Or the power
of life, the Dionysian force which brings life
to the smallest surface, the tiniest detail of a
Greek sculpture and makes it a joy to see and
touch?
The Greek idea of beauty may well have
sprung from the struggle of these two elements
clasped in an inextricable embrace. With time,
the Apollonian lost ground and the Dionysian
gradually triumphed and led to excesses of
realism. However, even at the end of its long
development, the art of ancient Greece, in spite
of its capacity for penetrating the secrets of the
human soul and its plastic virtuosity, never went
so far as to create a gallery of portraits, a chronicle
peopled with figures, as the Romans did. Until
the end Greek art was illuminated, however
dimly, by the tender and beautiful light which
emanated from the Greek idea of the perfect man.

Ahe conversion of the Slavs in 988 AD brought
Byzantine culture as well as Christianity to Rus¬
sian lands. And Byzantium in its turn had been,
through Alexandria, the heir to Graeco-Roman
civilization. Thus it can be said that medieval
iconsthe product of early Christian and Byzan¬
tine artappear at the end of an unbroken line
rooted in classical traditions.
Because of this it has been said that Byzan¬
tine art was in a state of permanent renaissance,
always turning towards classical ideals in order
to solve its aesthetic problems. We can see aspects
of this tradition in icons which depict Christ and
the apostles dressed in the robes of philosophers
of ancient Greece, and in others which show
evangelists in the pose, the architectural setting
and even the clothes in which classical authors
had been depicted. When we look beyond the
dream-like and fantastic architecture in Russian
icons, we can distinguish the forms of Greek
colonnades, pediments or atriums.
Built as it was on early Christian and
Hellenistic foundations, medieval Byzantine and
Russian art thus embraced principles of form,
proportion, symbolism and colour that go back
to the great treasure houses of ancient knowledge.
This knowledge was the essential source of energy
of Christian culture and provided the wealth
of thought and beauty that nourished the living
tradition of icon painting for over a thousand
years.
This knowledge postulated certain universal
principles about God, or the Absolute, about the
world and Creation, and about man. It was com¬
plemented by a body of philosophical and reli¬
gious teaching which was at first communicated
orally and later expressed in books and in var¬
ious forms of religious art, including architecture
and painting. At the highest level, the art of
imageryiconographyis a vehicle for
philosophical and theological ideas. It is in this
sense that icons have been defined as "theology
in colours".
Beauty in icons has to be seen in this perspec¬
tive. Medieval artists had no conception of beauty
for its own sake, which is a Romantic idea dating
from the early nineteenth century. For them, as
for the artists of Antiquity, beauty was an
attribute of the Good, which was Plato's name
for one of the highest realms of the universe.
Christians, who inherited the Platonic view
of the cosmos, described the realm of the Good
as that of the "Heavenly Powers and Principali¬
ties". The teaching behind religion and
philosophy, which can be found in the symbolic
imagery of sacred literature and also in icons, is
aimed at bringing the divine Good down to man
on Earth and at the same time raising man to the
level of the Good.
For some, the purest expression of these ideas
was given by Christ to his immediate followers,
without the help of books or images. His mes¬
sage was intended to help humanity pass through
the crisis of the collapse of Graeco-Roman civili¬
zation and to usher in a new era. Orthodox Chris¬
tianity takes, from Greek philosophy the view of
the universe as what the sixth-century monk St.
John Climacus called a "ladder of divine ascent".
According to this view, the cosmos is a hierarchy
with God at the highest point. He is the Pan¬
tocrator, the Ruler of the Universe; Earth is far
below, in the shadow, threatened by Death, by
Satan and darkness. Man stands on Earth. His
physical body is held there but, because of the
spark of divine fire in his soul, he yearns to ascend
towards the angels and archangels, the starry fir¬
mament, the powers and principalities of the
divine world where he rightly belongs.
A spiritual voyage
According to mystical tradition the idea that man
is "made in the image of God" means that we
carry the universe within ourselves. The life of
the soul can be understood as an inner journey
that takes place, not in the three-dimensional
world and in time, but in the spiritual universe
within us.
In the Middle Ages the imagery of icons
served to illustrate some of the key events that
man must inevitably encounter in his spiritual
life. Christ said that we must be "reborn of the
spirit", and the events described in the Gospels
and illustrated in icons can be understood in
terms of the spiritual world. The image of the
Nativity, in which a ray of light descends from 35

### NON-ARTICLE-TEXT
the higher world and illuminates the dark cave
of the lower world into which Christ is born, is
therefore not so much a literal description of an
historical event as a commentary on the meaning
of spiritual birth.
Icons are best understood as abstract rather
than pictorial art, as psychological images
speaking through symbolism and allegory. Time
does not exist in icons and is replaced by eter¬
nity. In the same way space is not limited to the
three dimensions of our ordinary world. Icons
take us to a world of many more dimensions than
our physical senses can perceive.
All icons are diagrams of the universe.
Whether we understand by this the universe out¬
side ourselves (the macrocosmos) or the universe
within us (the microcosmos), the symbols have
the same value. God and the world of the Abso¬
lute are expressed by a hand extending from the

circle in the upper part of the icon; the firma¬
ment or celestial world by a plain gold back¬
ground; the angelic or spirit world by winged
angels; man (signifying the soul) by Christ and
36 ii i
the saints ascending and descending, or by war¬
riors struggling with the forces of the lower
world.
From the icon Christ gazes deeply into the
soul of the onlooker with a compelling and per¬
sonal regard. Within the nimbus around His head
are letters meaning "I AM". This is an appeal to
what lies most deeply within us. Christ does not
address the thoughts and feelings of our outer
selves; He calls to the hidden, inner self.
The asceticism of the icon painter
Plato's idea of Truth, Goodness and Beauty as
equivalent concepts representing the highest ideal
can be used to help us assess the quality of icons.
If the universe created by God has order, propor¬
tion, harmony and balance, and if these are the
product of Truth, Goodness and Beauty, then all
these qualities must be found in works of art that
celebrate God's Creation. Such works of art will
manifest beauty, as well as goodness and truth,
because they are themselves part of that creative
process and conform to its laws.
Icons are works of art of this kind when they
are painted by a man who has by an inward
ascent found divine order within himself. This
can only be achieved through scrupulous spiritual
discipline. The person must train himself to con¬
centrate exclusively on contemplation, prayer and
inner silence and never let himself be distracted
by idle thoughts and day dreaming. He must
achieve complete self mastery through what the
monks on Mount Athos called "voluntary
suffering". This self training gives inner power
and purity which provide the psychic strength
that brings a man or a woman nearer to the divine
light.

Such a person aims to establish permanent
contact with the higher self, or at least the ability
to concentrate himself there when necessary. If
he becomes an icon painter, his art is bound to
express beauty, as well as truth and goodness,
because these qualities will be reflected in every¬
thing he does, just as the presence of light dispels
shadow.
The law governing the effect of light on dark¬
ness applies equally to the spiritual and to the
physical world. It is the same law with two
aspects, one visible and sensory, the other
invisible and psychic. Icon painters could use this
principle to illustrate the invisible in terms of the
visible. This accounts for what otherwise seems
illogical in the icon. For example, the absence of
shadows indicates a luminous world where God
is present and therefore there can be no outside
source of light. The beings depicted are them¬
selves sources of light.
Icon painters inherited from Hellenistic
philosophy the idea that the world was created
by the entry of spirit into matter, and they
believed that light was primarily spiritual. They
also understood that its component elements are
colour. Knowing that the law of spirit and matter
operates at all levels, they could demonstrate by
their use of colour the descent of the Divine Spirit
into the world of humanity. Their art was a phys¬
ical celebration of this divine manifestation, both
in the cosmos and in themselves.
When looking at icons today, we may be
reminded that this incarnationthe birth of
Christ within manis still a possibility.

Moroccan artist Mehdi Qotbi.
JJFIC, one of the great traditional styles of
Arabic script, is formal, angular and dignified. But
when it is traced on vellum in translucent sepia
ink, it acquires a mysterious sensuousness, while
losing none of its majesty.
Over the ages, Arab-Muslim calligraphy
gained in subtlety and beauty from its encounters
with many different cultures. Although the under¬
lying geometry did not disappear, curved script
finally prevailed and the letters became distended,
arched or rounded. Some letters branched out so
much that they transformed the walls on which
they were inscribed into gardens of delight through
which the eye was led along a voluptuous path
between downstrokes and upstrokes. Other letters
were adorned with decorative motifs which coun¬
terbalanced empty surfaces. Where strict geometry
prevailed, colours such as the warm blue or tur¬
quoise of ancient ceramics that still enchant us
today were used to soften excessive rigour. The
quest for beauty was centred entirely on the
word, because figurative imagery was disallowed.
38
Working on wood, leather and bone, and
later on parchment, stone, glazed brick and
other surfaces, generations of calligraphers
enriched their art and transmitted their skills
orally to apprentices who respected the old
traditions.
How do things stand today? Aesthetic values
are not immutable. Just as attitudes to time and
distance have changed beyond measurethink of
the abyss that separates the cities and caravans
of Antiquity from our age of interplanetary
explorationso the scope of creativity has
expanded. Sign and image have been reunited, but
in an anarchic proliferation which must be
mastered, just as techniques for using the new,
synthetic colours must be learned.
In these conditions, how can modern cal¬
ligraphers express themselves and remain faithful
to the lights of inner truth and profound
experience that guide them, and without forget¬
ting the tradition they have inherited? How can
they renew their art without betraying it? It
seems to me that they must do two things. The
first concerns the content of the phrases they
wish to transcribe. The second concerns their
choice of instruments. Content and form are
inseparable.
Traditionally the Arab calligrapher has
always worked with a calamus, a trimmed reed
pen no thicker than a finger. For large-scale
inscriptions such as those intended for the deco¬
ration of panels or walls, the outline of the letters
must first be traced and then filled in with colour,
using a brush. If broader instruments are used,
either on their own or with the calamus, the
ancient signs can be given a new lease of life.
I make my own calligrapher's tools from
wood, cardboard and other materials. I also use
brushes. The signs I trace with these instruments
are still recognizable for what they are, but their
appearance is profoundly modified. As a Chinese
calligrapher once put it: "When the idea is at the
tip of the brush, there's no need to look any
further."
Calligraphy is an art form governed by strict
rules, and the time it takes to transcribe a line

technical means to dawdle or to hurry. Today I
write ten times faster than I once did. My hand
moves rapidly across the page, tracing simultane¬
ously the outline of the words and the shape of
the composition. Not only my hand but my
whole body is engaged in this act that unlocks
a treasure-house of patiently acquired skills. To
write quickly a calligrapher must have absolute
control over movement and breathing alike.
Colours are prepared just before one starts
to write. Pigments and binding agents are blended
with varying degrees of thickness. Colour should
be elegant, flow with perfect ease and illuminate
the act of writing. Its translucence reflects a
smooth, sensual world that radiates calm and
serenity. To achieve such control, the substances
from which the colour is made must be tamed.
When the relation between form and colour
is harmonious, calligraphy is a joy to behold. As
for the act of composition, it is a mirror of my
feelings as I write. Form, whether extroverted or
introverted, is always linked to a moment of

experience from which it derives intensity. I
believe that beauty can originate from this match
between what I write and what I am.
At the heart of the composition throbs an
autonomous world, a field of energy subjected
to the rhythm that I impose on the movement
of the letters. Sometimes the strokes are traced
upward, as if they are about to take flight; at other
moments they settle demurely, as if at rest.
If the form is as it should be, if the strokes
flow confidently, then the artist is content. Cal¬
ligraphy becomes a language of the body,
explaining what surges inexplicably from deep
within the writerchildhood memories or more
recent experiences. These dream-images are mar¬
shalled into shape, they unfold as the leaves unfurl
when the seed becomes a tree. The calligrapher
must guide and direct these sparks of life. The
image of sap rising from branch to branch comes
to mind, and that of a group of dancers obeying
a choreographer's command. I should like to be
the choreographer of my letters and make them
dance across the white page. I translate what I feel
into gestures, and suddenly my reverie is visible.
But how much patient groundwork has to be
done! How much concentration is needed to cap¬
ture this impulse in full flight!
I elongate some letters and compress others;
I soften verticals and flatten curves. When my
letters take flight, I fly with them too. When they
come back to earth, so do I. Sometimes chance
lends a hand, helping me delve more deeply into
my intuitions. In calligraphy, beauty is not always
necessarily triumphant or voluptuous. It can also
result from conflict or drama. For balance to be
restored, the calligrapher must work with great
precision. Then beauty becomes a help in trou¬
bled times. In creative moments, everything is
illuminated, everything becomes calligraphy:
nature, humanity, even the industrial world.
Form derives its energy from the place
accorded to it in space. Words, in Arabic, are
written horizontallybut I give them verticality
and, at the summit of the constructions which
result, I draw the letters together to enhance the
monumental quality of the composition.
In the past calligraphers wished only to reveal
the sublime, and even the slightest hint of inner
conflict was excluded from their work. Today I
can express whatever I wish, but with a liberty
that is mature, a desire that is tempered by a grain
of wisdom. The apprenticeship is long, and the
exercise is perilous. But in the end calligraphy
always rewards the patient and devoted practi¬
tioner.
The artist to whom calligraphy yields its
secrets experiences a sense of exaltation com¬
parable to that felt by dancers who whirl until
they are exhausted. All the storms that trouble
the heart are transformed into simple and pure
gestures. Vaster than the language in which it is
written, the calligrapher's work resembles the
natural sculptures that stand out against the desert
sky and lead the eye towards infinity.

Fra Angélico.

N everyday language aesthetics is roughly
equivalent to the philosophy of art or the theory
of the beautiful, and people are apt to think that
these expressions denote a human preoccupation
so basic that in one form or another it must
always have existed in every culture. But (as so
often happens) the general opinion is misleading:
aesthetics proper is a recent discipline, born of
a real revolution in our perception of the
phenomenon of beauty.
The first book to bear the title "Aesthetics"
appeared in 1750. This was the German
philosopher Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten's
Aesthetica, which was itself made possible as the
result of a twofold upheaval in the position of
art, from the points of view of the artist and of
the onlooker.
Let us deal first with the artist's side. In
bygone civilizations works of art fulfilled a sacred
purpose. As recently as in ancient Greece their
function was to reflect a cosmic order entirely
external to mankind. By virtue of this externality,
41

given that the divine is essentially whatever eludes
and transcends humanity, they acquired a semi-
religious dimension. They were microcosms
(etymologically "little worlds") supposedly
representing in miniature the harmonious proper¬
ties of everything the ancients called "Cosmos".
It was this that gave them their "impressive
greatness"their ability actually to impress
people, who accepted them as phenomena from
without.
In this context works of art had "objec¬
tivity". They expressed not so much an
architect's or sculptor's genius as divine reality,
which they apprehended in their capacity as
modest rhapsodists. We are still so conscious of
this that it does not really matter very much to
us who carved a given statue or bas-relief, any
more than it would occur to us to look behind
the Egyptian cats in the British Museum for the
artist's name. What matters is that they are sacred

animals, transfigured as such in the realm of art.
The modern image
of the artist
Our attitude to works of art has changed radi¬
cally. In some ways it has actually done a U-turn,
in the sense that we may well be acquainted with
the names of creative artists, and even with some
aspects of their lives, and yet know nothing about
their work. The French composer Pierre Boulez
is admired as an intelligent, cultured man who
appears on television, but apart from a tiny élite
made up largely of professional musicians, who
has heard his latest composition, Répons? Even

in less extreme cases, what Nietzsche predicted
in the nineteenth century has become the rule
in modern democratic societies. Works of art are
no longer portrayals of the world but consum¬
mate expressions of an artist's personalityin
short, highly elaborate visiting-cards. The over¬
whelming majority of avant-garde works of art
in the major museums of New York, London and
Paris are like traces left by strokes of genius, in
which we may detect Duchamp's sense of
humour, Stella's imaginativeness and Hartung's
violencecharacter traits rather than a represen¬
tation of a shared world.
Be that as it may, this revolution in attitudes
to artists contains the seeds of the avant-garde
ideology that was so profoundly to affect con¬
temporary art. Admittedly there were "artists"
in pre-democratic societies, but they were not
"geniuses", if by that we mean creators ex nihilo
capable of finding within themselves all the

### 87660: The Origins of aesthetics
sources of their inspiration. The artist of Antiq¬
uity was not so much a true demiurge as an inter¬
mediary between man and the gods.
By reaction it is understandable that the
requirement of radical innovation and originality
that goes with the modern image of an artist
should be inseparable from the tabula rasa
ideology so clearly expressed in the concept of
the avant-garde. The beautiful must not be dis¬
covered as though it already existed in the objec¬
tive world, but invented: and thereafter every
moment of innovation will find a place in a his¬
tory of art (embodied at institutional level in a
museum).
The crisis now affecting the avant-gardes can
be understood only in the context of this history
of subjectivity. It stems in essence from the inner
contradiction inherent in the notion of absolute
innovation. As the Mexican poet and essayist
Octavio Paz has convincingly shown, the act of
breaking with tradition and creating something
new has itself become traditional in the late twen¬
tieth century. The signs of subversion that punc¬
tuated the history of the avant-garde no longer
surprise us. They are by now so banal and com¬
monplace that they have themselves become
museum pieces on a level with the most orthodox
works of art.
The triumph of sensibility
So much for the change on the artist's side. The
corresponding change on the onlooker's side has
to do with the notion of taste. This term was
apparently first used, at any rate in the metaphor¬
ical sense, in the works of the seventeenth-century
Spanish philosopher Baltasar Gracián to denote
man's entirely subjective ability to distinguish the
beautiful from the ugly: i.e. (unlike the situation
in the ancient world) the beautiful no longer
denotes a quality or set of properties belonging
intrinsically to certain objects. As the early trea¬
tises on aesthetics emphasize, beauty is subjective;
it resides essentially in whatever gratifies our taste
or sensibility.
Hence what was to become the central
problem of modern aesthetics, the question of
criteria. If beauty is subjective, if it is (as we say)
a matter of taste or sensibility, how then are we
to explain the consensus that exists about so-called
"great" works of art? How does it come about
that some artists, against all expectation, become
"classics" even beyond their own centuries and
cultures? Once these questions are posed we slide
effortlessly into the orbit of modern aesthetics.
Obviously this account of the origins of aes¬
thetics is primarily valid only for the European
sphere and areas directly conditioned by it.
Nowadays people are searching for a definition
of Europe. It could of course be said to be the
continent of Christian nations, and that is obvi¬
ously not false. I would prefer to define Europe
as the realm of secularity, not because it suppos¬
edly rejects the wearing of this or that item of
clerical attire, but because it put an end to the

era of theological politics. The symbols of this
are the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the
Citizen and, more importantly, the institution of
the National Assembly. Secularity means essen¬
tially a new relationship with the law, starting
with the fact that it stems no longer from cosmic
or divine sources but (for better or worse) from
human ones which are, in theory if not in prac¬
tice, within the volition of individuals.

### 87660: The Origins of aesthetics
The theme of the ending of theological
politics lies at the heart of all modern political
philosophy. From Hegel to Heidegger and from
de Tocqueville to Weber, David Friedrich Strauss,
Hannah Arendt and Louis Dumont, everything
(or virtually everything) has been said about the¬
ories of the social contract, the birth of humanism
and the decline of religion in democratic socie¬
ties. Less attention has been paid to the ending
of what might be called theological ethics, the
derivation of standards and laws from a realm
external to man.
Art on a human scale
But it is no exaggeration to say that the erosion
of theological culture still largely remains to be
worked out. The debates we have been witnessing
since the demise of Marxism are often between
the "optimists" who regard modernity as a slow
but inescapable process of emancipation from
tradition, and the "pessimists" who are more
inclined to see it as what might be called a logic
of "decline". In many respects these arguments
are symptomatic of a change in the position of
a culture which in modern times has essentially
assumed the shape of aesthetics.
It would be absurd, all the same, to use the
word decline. Value judgements are inappropriate
when it is a matter, first, of understanding some¬
thing that exists. But it would be equally point¬
less to disregard a radical change whose origin
goes back to the invention of modern aesthetics,
with its necessary corollary, the artist's primacy
over the world. In our democratic secular world,
with its ever-growing insistence on autonomy,
exception tends to be taken to any reference to
things external to mankind, and perhaps we
should be glad of this. But in such circumstances
it is only to be expected that art should also have
surrendered to the requirement to be "on a
human scale".
For this it quite simply needed to sever its
traditional ties with the sacred. The avant-gardes
of this century, with their exhibitions without
pictures and their silent concerts, have taken the
break as far as it will go. The only question is
whether or not it will be possible, in the vacuum
left by their demise, to recreate a shared world on
the basis of a radical rejection ofall transcendence.

The language of acacias
The acacia tree emits
biochemical alarm signals when
threatened, according to a
report presented by South
African zoologist Wouter van
Hoven to an international
conference at Montpellier
(France) in September 1990. By
producing ethylene, a colourless
gas with a sweet odour, acacias
warn one another of danger, as
from a browsing animal. When
nearby trees receive the signal
transmitted by the ethylene in
the air, their leaves fill with
tannin, a substance found in
many plants which may
be toxic when eaten in large
quantities.
Dublin's fair city
Dublin will be officially
designated Cultural Capital of
Europe 1991 at a ceremony in
Dublin Castle next March. A full
programme of cultural events is
scheduled until October,
including a meeting of leading
European creative artists in
June, a literary festival and
international theatre events. The
programme's strong literary
flavour is not surprising, since
Dublin is the birthplace of such
noted writers as Jonathan Swift,
Oscar Wilde and James Joyce,
as well as three authors who
have been awarded the Nobel
Prize for LiteratureW.B. Yeats,
George Bernard Shaw and
Samuel Beckett.
Island of hope
The main building on Ellis
Island, the immigration station
in New York Harbor that was the
United States' most famous port
of entry, was dedicated as an
immigration museum on 9
September 1990. Between
1892 and 1924, 12 million
immigrants arrived on the
island, mainly from Italy and
Eastern Europe. Constructed
between 1897 and 1900, this
vast building with its great hall
where processing took place
and a "stair of separation"
down which immigrants stepped
to begin life in their new
country, has undergone a 7-year
restoration programme. Archival
facilities are available to visitors
and scholars in a library and
reading room.
AIDS vaccine
A vaccine against AIDS will
not be available within the
next 10 years, although in 5
years' time there will be a range
of drugs to prolong the lives
of persons with AIDS,
according to Hiroshi Nakajima,
Director-General of the World
Health Organization (WHO).
Speaking in New York in
September, Mr. Nakajima
said that AIDS is now the
primary cause of infant mortality
in many developing countries,
especially in Central Africa.
To combat other child
diseases, WHO is contributing
to an international initiative
to develop a "children's
vaccine" which will deliver
many immunizing antigens in a
single dose.
Great themes of humanity
The Italian publishing company
Eldec is launching a
monumental work entitled
"The Great Themes of
Humanity", on which a
50-strong team has been
working for 10 years. The
series consists of 20 300-page
volumes on themes such
as love, the unconscious,
beauty, work, adventure,
friendship, power, and dreams.
Each volume includes a
philosophical introduction
to the theme, a study of its
treatment in world literature,
and a wide-ranging critical
commentary. The illustrations
are by 20 internationally
known Italian artists, each of
whom is responsible for one
volume.
Popularizing science
Molecular biology and brain
research are the two most
often treated subjects in
international scientific journals,
according to John Maddox,
editor of the British scientific
weekly Nature, and Eugene
Garfield, president of the
United States Institute of
Scientific Information. Both
men note that the non-
specialist press is playing
an increasingly important
role in the spread of
scientific information, partly in
response to growing public
interest in scientific research.
Aid for the disabled
The robotics section of
France's Commissariat for
Atomic Energy has developed
an aid for disabled people.
Known by the acronym of
"Master", the robot is an .
articulated arm equipped
with a pincer-like hand.
Computer-controlled and
activated by voice or keyboard,
it can execute a range of
movements which are
difficult or impossible for
the disabled. The robot could
be mass-produced and
used to help disabled people
at work.
Water and life
The International Drinking
Water Supply and Sanitation
Decade, which ends in
December 1990, has led to
the provision of safe water
supplies for 700 million
people, but polluted water
still causes the death of
35,000 people each day
through diarrhoeal diseases.
To further the aims of the
Decade through the 1990s,
the United Nations
Development Programme
(UNDP) and WHO will continue
their efforts to provide safe
water and sanitation for the
hundreds of millions
of people who still have
no access to these services.
Amnesty
and children's rights
As a lead-up to the World
Summit for Children which
was held in New York in
September, t;he human rights
organization Amnesty
International called on
governments around the
world to stop the illegal killing,
torture and arbitrary
imprisonment of children and
to put an end to violations of
"their rights. According to
Amnesty, children are
victimized in many countries
because they are seen as a
"social or political threat".
Pyramid on Everest
Last summer a team of Italian
scientists, technicians and
mountaineers erected a glass
and aluminium pyramid housing
a laboratory at an altitude
of 5,050 m on the slopes
of Mount Everest.
The 3-storey construction,
which can accommodate up
to 30 people, is being used
for biological, medical,
ecological and meteorological
research.
Death by pollution
Each year 2,000 Europeans
die from diseases caused by
air pollution, according
to a confidential study
carried out by WHO on behalf
of the United Nations
Economic Commission
for Europe. According to the
study, millions of Europeans
live in areas where
air pollution has reached
a level that puts health at risk.
The countries of Central and
Eastern Europe are particularly
affected.
Hospital of the future
A multidisciplinary international
team from the American
College of Healthcare
Executives and Andersen
Consulting has designed a
fully computerized hospital
of the future. All
departments have instant
access to patients' dossiers,
thus avoiding errors
and excessive paperwork
while reducing costs.
The prototype hospital,
installed for three years
at the Informan exhibition
centre in Dallas, Texas,
will act as a forum for education
and research on better
integration of new technology
into medical care.
The Club of Rome
Ricardo Diez Hochleitner of
Spain will succeed Alexander
King as president of the Club of
Rome in January 1991. The
incoming president of this
institution which aims to
promote a better understanding
of world problems has
declared that "the work of the
Club of Rome will continue to be
guided by the conviction that
the material and cultural
enrichment of one part of the
world cannot be sustained by
the poverty and ignorance of
the other part".

I saw Lahore, star of the Punjab, at
night, and took its soul unawares. The
birds were roosting in the shadow of
the banyan trees. The pellucid notes
of a sitar were heard, and suddenly
a flute joined in.
According to the books, and to
hearsay, Lahore is the most beautiful
city in Pakistan. The Indus makes the
plain of the Punjab gleam with its
tributaries, which from earliest Antiq¬
uity have brought life and cultural
riches with them. Here at this fertile
crossroads Lahore was born and
grew, to become a key administra¬
tive, religious and business centre.
Lahore lies on a secondary track
of the Silk Road, and is watered by
the river Ravi. It assumed Its Impor¬
tance in the eleventh century, when
it became the capital of the sultans
of Rhazni. After a long period of tur¬
moil, destruction and short-lived
rulers it became ¡n the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries one of the
great cities of Mogul India.
Babur, founder of the Mogul
empire, made it a star of the first
order: under the Mogul dynasty
Lahore was adorned with buildings
that now form a splendid legacy.
I walked to the moonlit red sand¬
stone Fort. Founded, according to
legend, by Prince Loth, son of Rama,
it was rebuilt in the sixteenth century
by Babur's descendant Akbar and
embellished by his son Jahanglr and
his grandson Shah Jahan. The twenty
or so buildings contained within its
ramparts afford an excellent picture
of the development of Mogul art over
nearly two centuries. Audience
chambers and mosques, princely
apartments, royal baths and pavilions
are disposed around gardens, ter¬
races and ornamental ponds.
I dreamed awhile ¡n the Naulakha,
a small marble pavilion encrusted
with semi-precious stones in floral
and geometrical designs. I left the
Fort by the Elephant Passage (Hathi
Paer); and as I stood ¡n front of the
mosaics on the enclosure wall my
imagination for a moment conjured
up the festivities and pleasures of the
court, the elephant and camel con¬
tests, and the polo games. Nowadays,

### 87661: The Magic of Lahore
in the dry moat, men in dazzlingly
white cotton scythe the grass, as
though to obliterate the passage of
time.
I saw the sun rise over Lahore, and
the rosy droplets in the dawn, when
the faithful come home from prayers.
I saw the sun light up the Shalimar
Gardensthe famous "Garden of
Love" laid out by Shah Jahan himself
in 1642. He had a canal dug to bring
water from the Ravi, to replenish the
ponds and irrigate the orchards and
beds of roses, cyclamen and iris.
The royal family would have come
out on to the three terraces, with
their slender marble and sandstone
pavilions set amid the delights of the
trees, and the music of the birds and
fountains, in search of coolness and
to be entertained with dances and
concerts. At nocturnal festivities the
light of camphor-scented candles
would have given the cypresses,
pomegranate trees and waterfalls
mysterious shapes.
The following lines, carved in the
stone beside a fountain, were once
wrung from the sorrowing heart of
Princess Zebun-Nisa, daughter of the
emperor Aurangzeb:
"0 waterfall, for love of whom
shed'st thou thy tears?
Whom mournest thou? In whose
memory hast thou furrowed thy
brow?"
I saw Lahore unfolding to the light,
its women clad in tulip- and mango-
coloured fabrics. The men sweltered
in the heat. In the Shahdara Gardens
I walked to Jahangir's tomb, erected
by his son Shah Jahan, who also built
the Taj Mahal at Agra, in India. An
avenue of venerable banyans and
huge fig-trees leads to the marble
and sandstone mausoleum. On the
enclosure wall a plethora of white
marble ornament representing bowls
of fruit, flowers and ewers is
arranged in elegant mosaics.
To reach the heart of the monu¬
ment I followed a passage decorated
entirely with frescoes from wall to
ceiling, and found myself in another
world. The wind sighed through the
cloisters of the cenotaph. All white
marble, it bears sacred inscriptions
in black marble the ninety-nine
attributes of the name of Allah.
Around the plinth run floral mouldings
in semi-precious stones lapis lazuli,
amethyst, agate and turquoise

mined in the Karakorum Mountains.
How gentle death seems, by the side
of this tomb!
I heard the five calls to prayer ring
out over Lahore. At the mosque of
Wazir Khan, in the heart of the old
city, I admired the brilliance of the
paradise flowers in the splendid cer¬
amic mosaics of this shrine built in
the reign of Shah Jahan. At the Bad-
shahi mosque with its daring marble
domes, built likewise in the seven¬
teenth century by Aurangzeb, the
sun flooded the huge square court¬
yard in which 60,000 worshippers
can pray at once. Its four minarets
climb high into the sky like soaring
birds.
I saw the burial-place of guru Arjan,
fifth prophet of the Sikhs, and the
Samadhi, tomb of the illustrious ruler
Ranjit Singhmagnificent relics, with
their fluted golden domes, of the
period (1764-1849) when Lahore
was the capital of the Sikh kingdom.
I saw Lahore in the middle of the
day, when men surrender to sleep
and a nightingale sings in the shade.
I saw the peacocks displaying in the
English parks, and breathed the
heady scent of the frangipani trees.
During the century of British rule
(1849-1947), a university, cathedral
and other public buildings were built
in the composite style known as
Mogul Gothic, and parks and broad
tree-lined avenues were laid out. The
first curator of the fine Lahore
Museum, which contains inter alia a
splendid collection of Mogul
paintings, was Rudyard Kipling's
father John Lockwood Kipling.
I left Lahore at the time of day
when people weave garlands of
roses, zinnias and marigolds for the
dead. Just before daybreak I betook
myself to the poet's tomb, cooled my
hands and forehead at a nearby foun¬
tain, and murmured to myself these
lines by Mohammad Iqbal:
"I would not let my heart become
attached to this garden:
I went my way, free of all ties."

With Unesco assistance,
a vast rescue operation
The Fort and Shalimar Gardens at Lahore, Pakistan, were inscribed on the World
Heritage List in 1981, shortly after they had been seriously damaged by torrential
rainfall.
With Unesco assistance, the Pakistan authorities embarked on a restoration
programme. In many of the buildings crumbling cement has been replaced by con¬
crete reinforced with layers of a mixture of bitumen and polythene. Roofs have been
covered with jointed tiles and made more waterproof. Cement has been pumped
into fissures in roofs and walls, and a coat of plaster has brought harmony to the
façades.
Five other sites in Pakistan are inscribed on the World Heritage List: the archaeo¬
logical ruins at Moenjodaro (which are the subject of a long-term international
safeguarding campaign), Taxila, the Buddhist ruins of Takht-i-Bahi and the nearby
city remains at Sahr-i-Bahlol, and the historic monuments of Thatta.

TO THE EDITOR

In defence of freedom
I have been a subscriber to the
Unesco Courier for some time. Your
publication is of very high quality,
and reflects extremely well on
Unesco and its mission.
I write to express particular
pleasure in having received the
September issue in which there are
many articles dealing with the role
of a free press. I hope that the
articles contained in this issue will
be read widely in the many coun¬
tries and many languages served
by Unesco. You have done a great
service for the institution and a
great service for the media.
I wish you continued success in
the future.

Spelling It out
The pronunciation of the names of
people and places is bound to create
problems for the readers of a magazine
published in 35 languages. I suggest
that you add the transcriptions of
proper nouns into the International Pho¬
netic Alphabet, either in brackets in the
text or at the end of each article or
issue. You might even consider pub¬
lishing a glossary as an occasional sup¬
plement. Secondly, could you tell me
where I can obtain titles from the
"Archives Collection" mentioned in
your May 1989 issue on Modem
Manuscripts?
Luis Aprigio dos Anjos
Jurubim (Pernambuco, Brazil)
Your idea is very interesting, but don't you
think that adding lots of phonetic transcrip¬
tions to each article would make the magazine
harder to read? We don't always have enough
space for a glossary, but we do add explana¬
tory footnotes where we feel it is necessary.
The different language editions of the Courier
transcribe proper nouns into their own lan¬
guages.
The "Archives Collection" is co-published in
Brazil by the Conselho Nacional de Desenvol-
vimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq).

Homage to Hans Selye
A plaque to the memory of the Austrian-
born Canadian physiologist Hans Selye
(1907-1982) is to be unveiled at Mon¬
treal in October 1992 by the Canadian
government and the United States
National Institute of Health, in the
presence of Nobel laureates in phys¬
iology and medicine. Professor Selye's
work on stress, distress and problems
of adaptation to the modern world
saved millions of lives. He was
described by Albert Einstein as the
father of the general theory of phys¬
iology and medicine. A member of the
learned societies of many countries and
the author of over 60 bestselling
science books, he was also a
philosopher, poet, sociologist and
humanist. I would like to propose that
you devote a special issue of your
magazine to this genius of our time. An
appropriate cover illustration would be
Salvador Dali's work entitled Stress,
which was created for Hans Selye.

Rapid reading
The author of the article entitled "The
PC and the 3 Rs" published in your July
1990 issue on world literacy states that
although forecasts of the decline of
"book cultures" have often been made
in the last fifty years, the market for
conventionally published works has
held up in the face of ostensibly rival
media (recorded music, television,
video).
This is understandable since much
more information can be assimilated by
reading than by listening to cassettes
or radio, or by watching television. It is
possible to listen to an average of
9,000 words per hour, and to read
27,000 words. Rapid readers can
absorb some 160,000 words per hour,
more if they are particularly gifted. This
enormous difference explains the
superiority of books and other written
works to audio-visual material.
Sylvie Massenet

An Esperanto Courier?
In the Letters page of your July 1990 '
issue, three readers petition for an
Esperanto edition of the Unesco Cou¬
rier. As a supporter of Esperanto I share
their point of view, but wonder if such
a project is feasible at the present time.
Esperantlsts have many publications at
their disposal, and some of them would
be unable to afford a subscription to
your magazine because of the political
and economic situation in their coun¬
tries. One research organization which
uses Esperanto as a principal working
language, the International Academy of
Sciences in San Marino, has even set
up a foundation, the Dr. Klemm-
Fonduseto, to cover the nominal sub¬
scription fees of some of its members.
Perhaps it would be more realistic to
launch an "Esperanto column" in the
Courier, or to publish a special issue,
annually at first, to gauge readers'
reactions?

No smoke without fire
You have yielded to criticism (Letters
page, September 1990) from a
member of a non-smoking association
regarding a postage stamp with a pic¬
ture of a Danish actress holding a
cigaretteas ¡f this was a public
scandal or an affront to humanity!
I deeply regret the growing hostility
towards smokers. The use of tobacco
is not necessarily a weakness or a vice,
any more than the consumption of wine
and spirits. There is a difference
between those who use tobacco and
those who abuse it. To treat them all
alike implies a lack of tolerance and
respect towards the first group and
may cause offence to pipe and cigar
smokers' associations. I speak as a
non-smoker.

Agri-culture
I would like to suggest that you publish
an issue or a feature on the close rela¬
tionship which once existed, and still
does among certain peoples, between
agriculture and culture. The world's
growing numbers of city-dwellers are
becoming more and more cut off from
the natural rhythms of life. The gravity
of certain environmental problems
today is leading us to rediscover the
wisdom of those cultures which have
maintained their links with the natural
world.

Making contact
I think it is essential that regular readers
of the Courier, like myself, should be
able to write to one another and
express our differences of opinion in a
friendly and constructive way. Why
don't you give the full addresses of
readers whose letters you publish? If
you did, the magazine could act as a
bridge between people of different cul¬
tures, races, languages, religions and
social backgrounds, who have interests
in common.
