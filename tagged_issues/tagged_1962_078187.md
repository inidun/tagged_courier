### 63558: The Two faces of world health
Between twenty-five and thirty million
lives could be saved each year if health
conditions all over the world were the
same as those in the most advanced
countries. For The Unesco Courier,
Jean Manevy, of the World Health
Organization, has made a special inquiry
into world health today. His report,
published here, is focussed on two
basic features of the global health
picture: the contagious diseases which
are still the greatest cause of death
and misery in the less economically
developed countries and the "killers
of modern times" which afflict the
most economically advanced countries.
IN A MAKESHIFT DISPENSARY vaccination
against smallpox is given in a village of Latin
America. Here, three generations are being
immunised against this disease which still breaks
out in epidemic proportions in some under¬
developed countries. Systematic vaccination
campaigns carried out in Latin American countries
have achieved striking success in recent years.

THE TWO FACES
WORLD HEALTH
by Jean Manevy
The challenge of disease & poverty
If the frightening toll of human lives taken
each year by sickness is to be eliminated, the
less developed countries must first wipe out contagious
disease just as the more developed countries have done
over the past 50 or 60 years.
In a recent interview In Geneva, Dr. Albert Sabin, one
of the men who conquered polio, pointed out that health
conditions in the under-developed countries today are
comparable to those which existed in Western countries
about 60 years ago. "Let us hope," he said, "that these
nations will not wait 60 years to bridge the gap since they
can take advantage without waiting of the discoveries
and experience acquired elsewhere."
Two examples illustrate this point. In Sweden a
century ago the life span of the average person was 41
years; fifty years ago it went up to 52 years; today the
average Swede lives to be at least 70. In India fifty years
ago the average person could expect to live 23 years; ten
years ago average expectancy of life rose to 32 years; today
It Ls 42 years.
The description given by Sir Edwin Chadwick (England's
pioneer of public health legislation) of living conditions
in England less than a hundred years ago might well have
been written for many of the newly developing countries
of today:
"In the courts and alleys inhabited by the poor," he
wrote, "an entire family, or more than one, living in a
single room, was by no means uncommon. Worse still, they
had inadequate water for drinking, washing cooking, no
sanitation and very often not enough light and air. In
the North, the dark satanic mills had sprung up like
weeds. Around them lay vast areas of industrial slums,
where thousands of people lived in indescribably foul and
noisome surroundings, over-worked,- under-nourished and
racked by disease."
Today deaths from typhoid fever, dysentery, diphtheria,
whooping cough and measles are as much as 30 times
higher in the under-developed countries as they are
elsewhere in the world. The death rate for tuberculosis
stands twelve times as high; the Infant mortality rate is
three to four times higher. Malaria alone strikes down
hundreds of millions of persons each year and Ls responsi¬
ble for at least half a million deaths.
The fact is that the eradication of contagious diseases
now stands as Priority Number One on the urgency list of
action required for the 2,500 million human beings who live
in the under-developed regions.
Bad health is without a doubt the most serious obstacle
to a nation's economic and social development. When
disease is rampant production drops dragging down with
it salaries, living conditions and food consumption.
Inevitably the educational level of the nation suffers a
serious blow. Increasingly larger sums of money have to
be spent on curative medicine instead of on preventive
medicine with the result that the general state of health
of an entire country begins to deteriorate and plans
for economic development are often virtually paraly/ed.
This ls the famous "vicious circle of poverty," so often
spoken about, In which poverty engenders disease which
in turn engenders even greater poverty. '
Let us look at this vicious circle as It operates in the
case of malaria, a disease allecting 140 countries and
territories of the world. Malaria is one of the chief causes
of absenteeism from work and of the physical and moral
degradation of the individual. It reduces agricultural
output, blocks the exploitation of natural resources, and
thwarts eilorts made by countries towards Industrial and
commercial expansion.
IN A TRANQUIL SETTING offered by the park of a psychiatric
hospital, an old lady goes for her daily walk, hand-ln-hand with one
of the nursing staff. The economically advanced countries have van¬
quished many deadly epidemic diseases, but now face the serious pro¬
blems of cancer, heart diseases, mental health and aging populations.

WORLD HEALTH (Cont'd)
THE VICIOUS CIRCLE
A victim of'malaria is incapacitated for a period of at
least two months out of every year. During this period
he must be cared for and this often means that someone
from his family or amongst his friends must give up his
or her own work to do so.
Since the disease usually strikes during the harvest
season a malaria-stricken farmer finds himself incapable
of gathering in his crop of rice or maize. Furthermore
malaria saps a person's very will to work and undermines
his mental and physical energies. Unable to plough and
sow his fields the farmer finds his next year's crops
jeopardized.
But this is only part of the malaria story in the vicious
circle of poverty. Malaria is also a killer. Especially
when it strikes children. It is responsible for up to 15 per
cent, of infant mortality in malaria-infested countries.
The death of any child is a tragedy no matter where
it occurs. But In the poor, under-developed countries the
high death rate of children from malaria has economic
repercussions which reach catastrophic proportions not
only for the families directly concerned but for the
development potentialities of the community and indeed
the entire nation.
Let us grit our teeth and face some of the stark facts
squarely. If the figures and statistics about to be given
seem cold-blooded and inhuman when speaking of the
death of children, we must remember that they help to
explain the vicious circle of poverty which holds so many
under-developed countries in a tight grip.
For the family, the community and the nation in an
under-developed area, the birth of a child is considered
a financial investment in food, clothing and education.
It is generally recognized that this investment begins to
show returns only when the child has reached the age
of 15 at which time he begins to contribute to the family
and hence to the community and national economy. If
a child dies before the age of 15 his potential contribution
to the development of his country is nil.
The cost of premature deaths from malaria has been
calculated fairly accurately in a country such as Mexico.
Pocket dictionary of diseases
DILHARZIASIS: Sometimes called
snail fever. An intestinal disease
transmitted to man by a parasite found
in tiny snails living in slow-moving
streams. It attacks young people,
lowers vitality and labour productivity.
Irrigation works often help to spread
the disease into new territories. A
drug exists, but it is difficult to admi¬
nister. Prevention: if environmental
hygiene cannot be improved, then
streams should be cleared of aquatic
plants on which the snails live. Para¬
sites can be destroyed by treating water
with copper sulphate.
V«HOLERA: Intestinal disease caused
by a bacteria (vibrio) transmitted by
polluted water. The patient becomes
completely dehydrated and can die
in less than an hour after the first
symptoms appear. In the mid-19th cen¬
tury, murderous epidemics of cholera
raged across Europe. Can be checked
by vaccination. During epidemics a
"vaccinating pistol" can be used to
inject vaccine painlessly and twenty
times quicker than by a hypodermic
syringe. Long-established centres of
infection: India, Pakistan. There were
1,422 deaths in West Bengal during
the first six months of 1961. Preven¬
tion: clean water.
VjOITRE: A disease caused by
diet deficiencies. Affects 200 million
people. The remedy has been known
for a century: add iodine to kitchen salt.
Cost of this operation and some preju¬
dices against it still hinder large-scale
iodization of salt.
LEPROSY: Ten million sufferers
throughout the world, but only 20%
receive treatment of any kind. Less
contagious than tuberculosis. If
detected in time, can be cured, without
leaving any traces, by treatment with
sulphones. Treatment is nowadays
given by mobile teams or in permanent
centres not at all reminiscent of the
leprosaria of former times.
A/l.ALARIA: Transmitted by mosqui¬
toes and fought both with insecticides
(to kill mosquitoes) and drugs (to kill
parasites in the blood of sufferers).
250 million malaria patients in 1955,
140 million today. Newest danger:
certain species of mosquitoes develop
immunity to insecticides.
ONCHOCERCIASIS (River blind¬
ness): Is caused by a minute worm
transmitted to man by a fly, larvae of
which is carried by freshwater crabs.
When hordes of these worms invade
the human eye, blindness results.
200 to 300 million persons are believed
to surfer from the disease and entire
populations have been known to scatter
before it, leaving their lands depopu¬
lated. Insecticide sprays are now used
to destroy the flies.
PLAGUE: Transmitted to man by
fleas carried by rats. Current reservoir
of infection: wild rodents including
ground squirrels, prairie dogs. Dread
scourge of man for centuries. In India
alone an average of over 500,000 deaths
annually between 1898-1908. Total
deaths in Í959-60 only 19. Prevention:
anti-rat campaigns.
R>LABIES: Virus disease transmitted
to man by the bite of diseased dogs,
cats, wolves or foxes. One of the reser¬
voirs of the disease: Central American
bats. Prevention by destruction of
stray dogs, vaccination of domestic
dogs and cats.

Poverty breeds disease which in turn breeds more poverty. Two of the results of low produc¬
tion are poor nutrition and poor education. These result, in their turn, in sickness and a lack
of preventative and curative medical services. Chronically sick people, sapped of energy,
are poor workers. Health, education, and social and economic progress go hand in hand.
The average life span of a Mexican today is 45 years of
which 30 years are the productive period. If a man dies
at 30 then his productive period has lasted only 15 years
a loss of 15 years. Let us multiply this figure by 24,000
the number of Mexicans who die of malaria annually at
the average age of 30 and we find that the Mexican
economy is amputated every year of 360,000 potential years
of productive contribution. It has been estimated that
this amounts to a financial loss to the national economy
of 156 million dollars per year a straggering sum even
for a rich country.
Malaria, however, is only one disease in the long list
of maladies afflicting millions in the under-developed
countries. Lying as many do in tropical climates these
countries must cope with the factor of prolonged intense
heat which as we know is ideal for the spread of infection.
Hot weather favours the extension of disease in three
different ways.
1) It permits the rapid breeding of insects which
transmit the diseases they carry to man. Sleeping
sickness, malaria, yellow fever, dengue, filariasls, rickett-
siosis, kala-azar, etc... are all caused by .such Insect vectors.
2) It ls Ideal for the proliferation of microbes and tiny
parasites In water. Dysentery, cholera, typhoid and para¬
typhoid fevers, snail fever (bllharzlasls) are only a few
of the diseases caused by amoebae and bacilli found In
water.
3) Finally, hot weather ls favourable to the development
of Intestinal parasites and their eggs, deposited In damp
soil from human excrement. This accounts for many of
the dreaded Intestinal worm diseases, such as the anky-
lostomes, which are one of the chief causes of chronic
anemia and malnutrition.
While the climate of the under-developed countries
cannot be changed, the organization of hygienic .services,
the use of modern techniques, and the Intensification of
public health campaigns particularly In rural areas, have
already begun to show substantial results.
Without water there can be no cleanliness; without
cleanliness there can be no health. The .sanitary problems
of providing pure water and disposing of .sewage are

SMALLPOX: This killer disease is
an anachronism today, 150 years after
the discovery of smallpox vaccine.
It could be entirely eliminated if 80%
of the world's population were vacci¬
nated. Modern dangers: faked vaccin¬
ation certificates ; speed and volume
of international travel. Most afflicted
countries: India, Pakistan, Central
Africa. 60,000 cases in 1960. Impor¬
tant: booster shots at regular intervals
necessary.
I RACHOMA: Virus-transmitted eye
disease (right) can cause blindness.
WHO estimates victims at one-sixth
of the world's population (500 million
persons). In certain countries virtually
the whole population Is afflicted with
1% of all adults totally blind and 4%
"economically disabled" by blindness.
Regular treatment with antibiotics
checks the infection.
Tuberculosis : 309 million persons
given tuberculin tests and 117 million
vaccinated with B.C.G. between 1951
and 1960 in 41 countries and territories
out of a population of 800 million
inhabitants. Latest drug, Isoniazid,

One mother recently objected to WHO
doctor: "Your pills are fine but they
give my children too big an appetite."
TYPHUS: Transmitted by body lice.
Killed hundreds of millions of persons
in the past. DDT spraying of the body
and clothes now successfully destroys
the lice.
Y AWS: A highly contagious microbe
transmitted by simple contact. Chiefly
due to poverty and faulty hygiene.
Can disfigure and cripple victims for
life. Now cured with a single injection
of penicillin. 280 million persons
examined, 35 million treated between
1950 and 1960.
YELLOW FEVER: Transmitted to
man by a parasite-carrying mosquito.
Practically eliminated from the Ame¬
ricas. A few centres of infection In
central and eastern Africa. Prevention:
vaccination and anti-mosquito cam¬
paigns. Reservoir of infection:
monkeys, from whom mosquitoes suck
infected blood.

diseases transmitted to man by animals.
Psitticosis (parrots), rabies (dogs),

Malnutrition - deadly enemy of children
directly linked to two major health problemstyphoid
fever and dlarrhoeal complaints whose chief targets are
children. It has been estimated that one-quarter of the
world's hospital beds are occupied by victims of polluted
water. Among the worst enemies of children, especially
in hot weather, are the dlarrhoeal diseases.. Yet 30%
to 60% of these deaths could be prevented if pure water
supplies were assured. In Asia there are periodic out¬
breaks of cholera, a scourge which could be wiped out
if clean drinking water was available. In Latin America,
of all communities numbering more than 2,000 people,
70% have no adequate pure water supplies. In Africa
water is sometimes stored underground in ostrich egg
shells.
Fetching water is more often than not a woman's job
and it ls not unusual for them to spend more than half
their day at this exhausting work. In some regions the
practice of polygamy is justified by the need for the
master of the house to have enough wives to keep htm
properly supplied with water. In Puerto Rico, there was
a dramatic drop In the incidence of deaths due to
diarrhoea and enteritisfrom 480 per 100,000 to 62- per
100,000after a modernization of the water supply system
and drains was begun In 1945.
Malnutrition, called kwashiorkor In Africa, is a polyca-
rence, or "many lacks", in diet due to déficiences of protein,
iron and vitamins A, B, C and D. It attacks children at
the time whenthey cease to be breast fed and, deprived of
their mother's milk, receive the same food as the rest of
the family. Here is how a reporter of "World Health,"
the magazine of the World Health Organization, graphi¬
cally described malnutrition as he saw it recently in
Latin America:
"Malnutrition ls as ugly as it is widespread. Ugly? The
word is weak. Monstrous. We should like to think of
children as robust, hyperactive, pink-cheeked and smiling.
A COSTLY FEVER
In ancient times...
i i 	
There is no definite proof that malaria was
ever the sole or even the major cause of the de¬
cline of ancient powers and empires, although
this has been claimed in the case of the Greek,
Roman, Singhalese and some other civilizations.
But there can be no doubt that at certain times
malaria has been an important factor in the
complicated equation of civilization decay.
This was most likely true of ancient Mesopota¬
mia when the irrigation systems began to be
neglected, thereby opening the way to an
increase in malaria. Thus appeared the fa¬
mous "chain reaction" whose costly results are
evident today neglect results in malaria
which in turn leads to greater neglect.
...and today
World-wide efforts are now being made to
break this "chain reaction". One striking
example is offered by the Philippines where
anti-malarial campaigns have opened up pre¬
viously infested areas for settlement and agri¬
culture. Within seven years, rice acreage has
increased by 20% and other grain-producing
acreage by 28%. In 1960 self-sufficiency in
rice production was achieved for the first time.
Severely malnourished infants are a mockery of this
notion. They are creatures with scabbed bodies, swollen
joints. They cringe when you touch their red, cold skin,
though seldom do 'they cry out. Their bleak faces betray
little emotion or interest or hope. Their teeth are
wretched, their hair is thin. Yet the human being has
remarkable strength, and there is no better proof of this
than the fact that such pitiable infants can be returned
to the bloom of health with nothing more than food."
The transformation can be so complete as to be
unbelievable. Indeed, doctors find it difficult to convince
parents that only food and not medicine was used to
restore their baby's health in the course of a few weeks
in a hospital. But the parents must be convinced, and
they must be made aware of the importance of nutrition.
Among the pre-school group children from one to four
years of age about half the deaths are attributable to
malnutrition, and most of the other deaths are caused
by diseases which would rarely be fatal and usually
innocuous in well-nourished children.
In that same pre-school group In Latin America,
mortality is ten to forty times higher than it is in the
United States or Northern Europe.
T;oo often, parental Ignorance prevents a child
from getting valuable foods. After weaning,
children are fed nothing but gruels containing mostly
cornstarch. Uneducated mothers frequently believe that
milk causes diarrhea, not realizing that it does so only
because it is not boiled. Even if they can afford meat
once or twice a week, many mothers believe it produces
worms and cannot be digested by children.
Certainly malnutrition can be reduced through educa¬
tion. But the hard facts of economics are basic to the
problem. When a man earns barely enough money to
feed his family tortillas, he is in no position to worry
about buying eggs for breakfast or meat for dinner. In
order to allow him to raise his children properly, his
income must be raised.
Thirty years ago about 40% of the malnutrition cases
admitted to the largest hospital in Central America, San
Juan de Dios in San Jose, Costa Rica, were lost. Doctors
unfamiliar with nutrition deficiencies were giving the
patients massive quantities of vitamins, but few proteins.
Now the treatment has been reversed. Last year the
percentage of deaths among malnutrition patients was
only two. In acute cases, children are also given the
richest protein source of all, blood. Nature is still the
best chemist.
It is also beginning to be realized that cases of mal¬
nutrition should be followed up at home by public health
people, just like cases of infection. In that way the child
or the whole family can be "immunized" with milk.
Otherwise the patient will soon be back in the hospital.
Since conventional protein sources milk, eggs and
meat are beyond the purchasing power of the poor, diets
must be supplemented in other ways. One approach, an
extremely promising one, has been taken in Central
America, where malnutrition is severe. It has been
pioneered by and ls now being applied under the guidance
of INCAP, the Institute of Nutrition of Central America
and Panama, in Guatemala City in a building provided by
the government of Guatemala.
INCAP's 125-man staff is conducting basic research in
nutrition, imparting its knowledge to doctors of many
nations through summer courses and field schools, and
applying its findings in pilot programmes.
After conducting dietary surveys to learn local eating
habits, measure food consumption, analyze foods of the
area and arrive at an accurate picture of general health
conditions, the INCAP scientists set about finding a
practical solution. They knew they had to find a cheap
protein source, one that was consonant with food habits
and within reach of families whose dally income may be
the equivalent of a dollar or less.
Their efforts have produced an inexpensive all-vegetable

mixture called Incaparina, which is developed from corn,
sorghum, cottonseed flour and yeast. Mixed into water,
which the consumer bolls, and flavoured with sugar and
clnammon or vanilla, Incaparina becomes an atole with
the same protein value as milk.
Tested with dramatic success in 1959 and found to be
wholly acceptable to Latin American tastes, Incaparina is
now being produced commercially by private companies
who received the INCAP formula free of charge and give
the Institute in return the right to control the price, qua¬
lity and advertising. Applications for production have
been received from all over the world. One plastic
package containing 75 grammes of powder, reinforced
with calcium, B complex vitamins and vitamin A, costs
four cents. It is the nutritional equivalent of a quart of
milk costing twenty cents or more. It provides a child's
daily requirements of virtually everything but caloric
Intake and vitamin C, neither of which is lacking in Latin
American diets.

he doctor bent forward to listen to the chest
of the child. Through his stethoscope he
detected the shrill note he had suspected he would hear.
His lips spoke the blunt verdict: "Double pneumonia.
It's too late. He will die." He nevertheless gave the child
an antibiotic injection. The mother hugged her little one
to her breast. The father's fingers fumbled with the
acacia branch he was using as a walking stick. Then
the sad trio moved slowly away.
Even at midday it was not uncomfortably hot on this
plateau, ten thousand feet up In the rugged Devil's Moun¬
tain region bordering Ethiopia's northern frontier with
Sudan. The doctor, sent by the World Health Organiza¬
tion, was the very first medical man the inhabitants had
ever seen in this region. He was making an epidemiolo¬
gical inquiry, a two-year mission to find out from which
diseases Ethiopians suffer and die. In order to reach him,
the parents of the sick child had walked since the pre¬
vious evening.
As night fell the doctor learned that the child had
indeed died. First he saw several men walk by his tent
carrying picks and shovels. Then, through the dusk, came
the sound of chanting. Finally, the funeral cortege clim¬
bed the hill on which he was encamped. The child was
burled between a candelabra-shaped euphorbia plant and
a flame-of-the-forest tree on a site overlooking one of the
most grandiose landscapes in the world.
Today, the world faces a serious shortage of doctors.
According to figures published recently by the World
Health Organization there are 1,500,000 physicians for a
total population of 3,000 million.
But whereas Israel has one doctor for 420 inhabitants
(the world's most favoured country In this respect) there
is sometimes only one doctor for 100,000 people in some
other lands. Furthermore most of the doctors practice in
cities, leaving immense rural populations without medical
care. On the basis of a minimum need for 13 doctors to
every 10,000 people, a total of 3,900,000 doctors would be
required. Today the world has not even half this number.
For this reason, and following the recommendations of
the WHO, many countries which cannot afford to wait
until they have all the trained doctors they need are pro¬
viding accelerated training courses for medical assistants
who will set up health centres in country districts. The
job of these medical aides will be to report the outbreak
of epidemics, to give treatment for minor sicknesses and
ailments, to provide medical advice and, when necessary,
to send serious cases off to hospital. They are, as it were,
the watchmen of health and the first elements in a future
medical infrastructure for their countries. In Ethiopia,
for example, the training centre at Gondar has already
graduated 200 medical aides for the health centres that
have now been created in this province which had
hitherto been completely deprived of medical personnel.

PURE WATER A RARITY
For millions of people water is not simply something
that flows freely when a tap is opened. In Asia,
Africa and Latin America, deadly epidemics are
caused by the absence of proper drinking water.
Sometimes it has a bad taste. Often it is short
supply. When it is impure, child mortality rates
from dlarrhoeal disease rise alarmingly. Little girls
scooping up every last precious drop of water
(below) live in a Latin American suburb with
25,000 Inhabitants, where water flows from three
small taps for a few hours three days a week. In
Africa, the public water tap with a clean, cool flow
of drinking water (right) is still too often a rarity.
Even in economically advanced countries, rapid
increases in population growth call for constant
vigilance against infections. New York's water
supplies (1,100,000,000 gallons are used daily)
are checked weekly. To guard against infection
beach and harbour water is watched constantly.
Above, samples are taken in New York harbour.

thousands of people lived in indescribably
foul and noisome surroundings, overworked,
undernourished, racked by disease. The same
words could well apply to living conditions

whose health standards are still only compa¬
rable to those existing in many Western
countries 60 years ago. To bridge this gap,
the eradication of contagious diseases now
stands as Priority N° I. Diseases, like cholera,
typhus, smallpox and plague, have been van¬
quished in economically advanced countries.
They no longer spread death and terror
across Europe, decimating the population of
entire cities as did the plague in London

Hazards of progress & prosperity
In the most economically developed countriesa minority of 500 million
peoplecommunicable diseases have largely disappeared, infantile mortality has
been reduced to a low level and the average length of life often exceeds 70 years.
In these countries, 60 % of deaths are due to cancer and cardiovascular diseases.
The publicity given to these two "killers of modern times" is largely due to
the absence of other important causes of mortality, to the increase in the average
lifespan up to the age when these diseases are most common and also the improve¬
ment in diagnostic skill. The "killers of modern times" are, in effect, degenerative
diseases. This is what Dr. Pierre Rentchnick, of the University Medical Clinic,
Geneva, has to say about them:
The cells of the human body, under the in¬
fluence of a regulating mechanism probably
sited in the stem of the brain, are born, live and die at a
rate that varies according to the kind of tissue involved,
the organ, certain exceptional circumstances such as acci¬
dents, burns, etc. and Anally, the age of the individual.
When, as a result of deterioration of this regulating
mechanism, the cell division rhythm is upset because of
mechanical, physical, chemical or other reasons in asso¬
ciation with a factor X (which some people think ls a
virus), cell division may occur more rapidly and daughter
cells arise which begin to form a tumour and live like
parasites at the expense of healthy neighbouring cells.
Some tumours will remain benign, in other words are
strictly localized at the site where they arise, while others
may become malignant by erupting into the blood stream,
which carries the cancer cells to different organs, mainly
the lungs and bones. This spread of cancer cells takes
place according to laws as yet not elucidated.
Nowadays, with a larger number of methods at our
disposal, early diagnosis of a malignant tumour is possible
if the patient is examined in time. This early diagnosis
is of supreme Importance, because the time between the
beginning of the tumour's growth and the dissemination
of daughter cells (metastases) in the blood stream is, in
most cases, relatively long, extending over several months
and even years.
During this period minor signs and symptoms may be
of the greatest importance and should oblige the patient
to go to a doctor. They include injuries which show no
Courtes/ of the Clarendon Press, Oxford
tendency to heal, lumps and slight thickenings In the
breast, unaccustomed lass of blood from any of the body
orifices, constant digestive upsets or difficulties In
swallowing, alternate bouts of constipation and diarrhoea
with slight traces of blood In the stool, persistent cough
or hoarseness, prostatic enlargement and repeated attacks
of bronchitis.
The doctor, by a blood test, examination of the stool
or X-rays, can study and watch the development of any
one of these symptoms, perhaps detect a cancer at Its
very beginnings,' and, depending on the site, propose that
It be treated by X-rays, cobalt bomb or surgery.
These assertions, far from being Imaginative, arc solidly
backed by statistics. The campaigns for early detection
in the United States, the compulsory check-ups In the
U.S.S.R. the organized examinations In certain other
countries, have saved many patients' lives through early
diagnosis.
Women particularly should undergo regular medical
check-ups from the age of 30 or 35 on, so that any inci¬
pient malignant tumour of the breast or uterus can be
detected and treated In good time In the U.S.S.R. where
the patient not only has the right but also the duty to
be in good health, we were able to sec, In the course of
two visits in 1054 and 1950. that the advanced stages of
cancer of the uterus were unknown, for examination was
compulsory, well organized, and accepted by the women
who were regarded not so much as members of the popu¬
lation but as active and productive elements of a factory,
an administration, or an institute.

'TREES OF LIFE'. The venous system (left) and the
arterial system of the human body as depicted in the
Medicinal Dictionary compiled by James Robert (1743-1745).
Clogging arteries...
How can arteriosclerosis be defined? A very simple
description can be given if an artery is compared to a fine
rubber tube that loses its elasticity with the years, clogs up,
and becomes infiltrated with different substances it carries.
Its interior diameter becomes progressively smaller, and,
if greater pressure is exerted, the rubber tube may burst,
as a cerebral artery bursts in a hypertensive and arterio¬
sclerotic patient, and leads to a cerebral haemorrhage or
a stroke.
Scientifically, arteriosclerosis is the deposit of differ¬
ent fats, cholesterol and calcium, on the inner wall
of the great vessels, the aorta and the coronary and
cerebral vessels.
These arterial lesions may, to complete the picture,
be accompanied by disorders in the coagulation of the
blood, which may cause clotting (thrombosis) in the
vessels and stop the circulation in places. The tissues
normally supplied by these blocked vessels are thus
deprived of oxygen and nourishment, and may form a
completely inert area. The best-known example of this
process is coronary thrombosis.
...and cholesterol
The factors involved in the causation of arterioscle¬
rosis are many and various. One of the most con¬
troversial is the importance of cholesterol.
The most interesting arguments on its role in arterio¬
sclerosis come from clinical and epidemiological studies.
It is known that the disease is more common among the
obese, heavy eater, and in countries with a high standard
of living. Epidemiological studies have revealed the
existence of a statistical correlation between diet and
particularly the consumption of fatty foods and the
frequency of arteriosclerosis.
The first reaction was simply to lay the blame on cho¬
lesterol. But as experimental study continued, the ten¬
dency became rather to define the role of cholesterol
more explicitly and place more emphasis on that of
fats and certain combinations of fats and proteins. This
conception also relates to obesity caused by an excessive
intake of calories, chiefly from fat-rich foodstuffs.
Sedentary life has also been accused of favouring the
onset of arteriosclerosis. The sedentary person thinks
perhaps he is eating relatively little, but may be eating
far too much for his real needs. As he must take in
a certain number of calories, he should use them up
completely by some sport such as walking or by cycling.

Campaigns to lay the bogy of cancer
14
The following statistics, published in the United States,
show how the chances of cure depend on the early estab¬
lishment of a diagnosis:
Rate of cure
where diagnosis is
early: late
Cancer of the breast	 78 % 36 %
Cancer of the uterus 70 % 35 %
Cancer of the lips 90 % 15 %
Cancer of the skin	 95 % 40 %
Cancer of the rectum 40 % 3 %
Cancer of the bladder 55 % 5 %
Cancer of the large intestine 	 85 % 14 %
By laying the bogy of cancer through educating the
public, the campaign for early detection and treatment
can be more successful. It will never be known how many
thousands of deaths have been caused by false modesty,
shyness, the fallacies of popular medicine, or even fear,
in people who went to the doctor too late.
Medical associations have perhaps their share of
responsibility here. They should play a more active part
in the cancer campaign through the press, radio and
television.
A campaign conducted on a national scale should
obviously be well organized so that the public will not be
frightened by words or descriptions which overstep the
bounds of reality and unnecessarily create a "cancero-
phobia."
Health education should therefore be continuous so that
little by little scientific and technical terms become fami¬
liar and do not create panic. At the present time educa¬
tion tends to be too piecemeal, and cancer is usually men¬
tioned in connexion with the death of a politician or a
film star. Then there is a wealth of more or less imaginary
detail, and the general view is confirmed that the diag¬
nosis of cancer Is equivalent to a death sentence.
Along with cancer (and also accidents), diseases of the
heart (or more precisely the whole cardiovascular system)
are the most common causes of death in the modern
world.
The heart uses a great deal of oxygen, and is amply
supplied with blood by two special arteries coming directly
off the aorta, the coronary arteries. When these arteries
lose their elasticity from the thickening of their walls
with deposits of cholesterolthe condition known as arte¬
riosclerosis are no longer able to supply the heart
muscle with an adequate amount of blood. The result is
tissue malnutrition, often revealed by constrictive pain in
the thoracic region. It is a general phenomenon that
every functioning muscle becomes painful when its oxygen
supply drops below its needs, as occurs for example in
the muscles of the calf when there is narrowing or
occlusion of the arteries of the lower limb.
When instead of a simple narrowing of the coronary
arteries there occurs a complete obstruction because of
the formation of a clot (thrombosis), the blood flow is
interrupted and the area of muscle receiving blood from
that artery is deprived of its supply.
This portion of the heart muscle loses its capacity of
contracting and before long becomes necrotic, a develop¬
ment called infarction. Depending on where the necrotic
area is, death may follow immediately and does in about
10% of cases. The necrosis may in fact traverse the
whole thickness of the wall of the heart, which becomes
literally perforated. But in most cases, with present
methods of treatment, the infarction is gradually cured
(by scar formation) after complete rest for perhaps six to
eight weeks.
All epidemiological investigations show that coronary
thrombosis has increased in frequency. Mortality from
this cause in the United States was 20 per 100,000 in 1930,
and 70 per 100,000 in 1949. A similar development has
been observed in European countries, with considerable
variations according to geographical area and class of
population. It has also been observed that coronary
thrombosis is much less frequent among the Bantus, the
Japanese, and the Nigerians.
On the basis of these differences, an attempt has been
made to single out factors that play a part in the deve¬
lopment of the disease: constitutional and hereditary

factors, factors related to ways of life and especially to
consumption of foodstuffs rich in fats and particularly
in cholesterol, physical exercise, mental stress, and the
consumption of alcohol and tobacco. Statistics in some
countries tend to show that coronary thrombosis is com¬
moner among the wealthier classestheir physical acti¬
vity is less, their diet richer in fats, and their cigarette
consumption higher.
From the scientific point of view, it was logical to pay
special attention to eating habits, for the coronary arte¬
ries in infarction are characterized by a thickening of
their inner walls chiefly due to deposits of fatty material
among which cholesterol is abundant. Among some
sections of the population it has been observed that when
the amount of fat in the every-day diet is high the cho¬
lesterol level in the blood also tends to be high, and vice
versa.
Among all the populations so far studied, those with
a diet poor in fats are those which seem to have a relati¬
vely low incidence of arteriosclerosis, angina pectoris and
infarction. In prosperous countries like the United States
and Canada, more and more fat is being eaten. In some
of the less developed countries, the proportionate increase
in fat consumption is even greater. In Japan, for example,
where very little fat used to be eaten, -the consumption
is at present five times greater than it was immediately
after the war.
Investigations into the part played by tobacco in the
causation of cancer of the lung have shown incidentally
that mortality from coronary thrombosis is higher in
heavy smokers. It is surprising how frequently sufferers
from coronary thrombosis turn out to have smoked large
numbers of cigarettes (40 to 60 a day) up to the time of
their heart attack. The action of nicotine on the arteries
of the arms and legs is known a temporary constriction
causing a cooling of the skin but we know less about its
action on the coronary arteries.
As concerns the effects of alcohol on the development of
coronary thrombosis, views at present are divided and
fresh evidence is needed.
Until the end of the last war, the doctor's concern
in the presence of coronary thrombosis was to ease
the pain by means of morphine and to order bed rest.
The pain he could control, but he was comparatively
helpless In the face of the Illness, wich often lead to death.
In the last 15 years or so, a new method has been greatly
developedtreatment with heparin and dlcoumarol deri¬
vatives. The value of these drugs lies in the fact that
they reduce the clot-forming tendency of the blood, and
today it is considered thay they have brought down the
mortality from coronary thrombosis by .v)me 25 to 40';:,.
The surgeons who have dared to violate the sanctum of
the heartformerly regarded as untouchable have tried
to supplement medical treatment by operation. Some
have tried to Join neighbouring tissues to the heart In the
hope that new blood vessels will Increase the .supply of
blood to the heart muscle. Others have gone .so far as to
open the coronary artery to remove the clot responsible
for the infarctiona bold operation that has been
successfully tried only in a small number of selected cases.
The most recent experiment In the treatment of coro¬
nary thrombosis ls not surgical but medical. With new
clneradlographlcal techniques It Is possible to visualize
the coronary arteries and localize the clot. Then, by a
sound placed in the artery, the clot itself can be injected
with flbrlnolysin; this natural constituent of blood plasma
has the property of dissolving the clot In the early stages
of its formation.
Mental illness does not figure prominently as a cause
of death, but of recent years has taken on such Import¬
ance in our lives that it needs to be mentioned along
with the "killers of modern times."
How do people become mentally ill and how are they
cured?
Warning signs: Headaches, inexplicable fatigue, change
of personality, sleeplessness, loss of memory, a lowering of
work output, all require careful consideration by the doc¬
tor to distinguish between a passing Indisposition and the
first warning signs of mental disease. If preventive treat¬
ment ls given at this stage there Ls every possibility o'
avoiding mental illness.
Mental illness: A mental patient ls a person whose abi¬
lity to adapt himself to this environment is disturbed.
Often it ls advisable to free him from the usual demands
of social life. This is the primary reason for hospitaliza¬
tion and the hospital must provide the required atmo¬
sphere.

be a therapeutic community, that is, an artificial social
environment that strengthens the adaptive faculties that
have remained healthy and allows the others, first to rest,
and then gradually to be re-educated. Group activities
should be organized in accordance with the capacities of
the majority, If not all of the patients. These activities,
whether games, self-expression in an art or craft, sports,
lectures or discussions, should preferably be developed on
the initiative of the patients themselves, so that, as far as
possible, they correspond to their needs.
The therapeutic art: It is the task of the doctor to help
patients resume their interest in the world around them
and gradually to grow away from their pathological atti¬
tudes and engage in useful activities. Once the thera¬
peutic atmosphere has been created, more precise tech¬
niques can be applied.
Psychotherapy: The aim of this treatment is to elimi¬
nate the cause of internal conflict and permit the patient
to understand himself better.
Insulin shock: The method consists of injecting in¬
creasing doses of insulin until the patient reaches a state
of coma which is finally ended by giving him sugar. The
treatment is repeated every day for several weeks. The
patient's personality, temporarily disintegrated during the
coma, tends to return to normal on awakening.
Electric shocks: This method provokes sudden loss of
consciousness accompanied by important changes in the
body fluids, often followed by recovery of mental balance,
particularly in cases of melancholia.
Narcotherapy: Also called "narco-analysis", this treat¬
ment consists in intravenous injections of an anaesthetic
to remove the patient's inhibitions and even to plunge
him into the realm of the unconscious so that he can
express himself, relive certain experiences, and thus
be liberated from painful anxieties and sometimes deeply
rooted complexes. Another method is to put the patient
to sleep with the help of various narcotics for 16 to
20 hours a day over a period of 15 to 20 days so that the
overworked nervous system may rest and emotional
balance be restored probably through dreams. This is
known as the sleep treatment.
Modern drugs: Chlorpromazlne and reserpine and
many others that chemistry is discovering in great num¬
bers, seem to be able to selectively relax those functions
which are most commonly involved in mental disease.
Prolonged application, combined with psychotherapy and
sociotherapy, even without resorting to artificial sleep,
sometimes brings about a veritable resurrection. At all
events, these drugs relieve the most painful symptoms of
mental disorder such as agitation, anxiety, aggressiveness,
in nearly all cases.
Results: These vary according to the gravity and
length of the disorder. On the whole, however, one can
say that properly co-ordinated treatment under satis¬
factory technical conditions make it possible to restore
70 to 80 per cent of mental patients to normal social life.
The average stay in hospital, for patients who are cured,
is about four months. If we recall that a few years ago
only about 30 per cent recovered and that these patients
required on the average more than a year to get well,
the progress that has been made is evident.
Those who founded the World Health Organization
nearly 15 years ago defined health as: "A state of complete
physical, mental and social well-being." In the field of
mental health particularly, much remains to be done if
this definition is to be widely applicable. There are
2,000,000 mental patients In Europe alone and more than
one-third of all hospital beds are for mental patients.
Today the battle for mental health ls being fought on
many fronts. The psychiatrist has ceased to be merely
a "doctor for the Insane." With the help of his colleagues
from other disciplines he now tries to do something for
the many people who suffer neurotic difficulties and to
contribute to the cure of psychomatic disorders like
gastric ulcers and asthma. Moreover there is an increas¬
ing tendency to introduce mental health concepts Into
16 public health practice and to seek the advice of psychia¬
trists on wider social Issues such as community develop¬
ment and industrial organizations.

"The establishing of institutes and research
laboratories (concerned with problems ranging
from housing and social conditions to mental
health and epidemiology) is one of the greatest
contributions a country can render to the progress
of science", declared the World Health Organi¬
zation, in a major report on the health situa¬
tion around the world, covering I 57 countries.
Scientific research, today not only
occupies an enormous place in hu¬
man society, but is actually doub¬
ling its activity in the course of each
decade. This progress has been
charted in "Current Trends in Scien¬
tific Research", prepared by Profes¬
sor Pierre Auger, former head of
Unesco's Department of Natural
Sciences, and published by Unesco.
From this comprehensive survey of
world scientific trends and techno¬
logical research (See The Unesco
Courier, July-August 1961) we pre¬
sent here some salient facts on the
development of the medical sciences.

### 63560: Medical research today
MEDICAL RESEARCH TODAY
by Pierre Auger
T:he progress, of benefit to mankind, that has
come from great discoveries such as the
microbial origin of communicable diseases, chemothe¬
rapy, antibiotics, residual insecticides, etc., has actually
taken medicine almost from the Middle Ages to its pre¬
sent level in no more than the past half century.
Although the diagnostic skills of doctors thirty to forty
years ago can still be admired, the therapeutic facilities
at their disposal can now be seen to be, in many instan¬
ces, little better than pious hopes, and those few that
were effective were not well understood and were often
not properly used.
Clinical experience and acumen are greatly amplified by
precise investigations; skilfully prescribed and compound¬
ed medicines, to be taken with water before or after
meals, are largely replaced by single substances adminis¬
tered in a definite dose per kilogramme of body weight at
intervals chosen to maintain a desired blood level.
A further important and fundamental development
greatly influencing research is the change in attitude from
that wholly concerned with the sick individual to that
more widely concerned with keeping the healthy person
fit. The concern for sickness of the patient has thus
widened into that for the health of the community. The
older communicable diseases, for example tuberculosis and
syphilis, are being rapidly conquered and the problems of
the newer ones, such as poliomyelitis and other virus
diseases, are being solved.
These benefits are of value both to developed and
underdeveloped countries. For the former where people
live longer and where their lives are more sophisticated
the importance of cancer and the degenerative diseases
is great; in the underdeveloped countries so great is the
rate of change that these diseases may well be problems
there in the next generation. Another result Ls the in¬
creased size of populations and the attendant problems
of food supplies and nutrition; both of these call for
much thought and study.
The results of past research have been great and bene¬
ficial for man; those of the increasing research of the
future can be expected to be no lass, and will arise more
and more from fundamental studies though these may
often commence during the search for answers to practi¬
cal problems.
Medicine and medical research are no Ipnger mainly
concerned with bedside observations on diseased persons
and the study of the effects on them of empirical
remedies.
Advances in medicine today are based on the study of
the healthy as well as of the sick and the dead, parti¬
cularly In relation to their total bodily and mental envi¬
ronment. Disease is a condition that can be defined in
terms of deviation from the normal, and this means that
the medical research worker must observe the behaviour
of the so-called normal man as well as that of the
sick one.
For the effective prosecution of medical research not
only is the clinician needed but also workers in a number
of other disciplines, 6uch as physics, nuclear sciences,
chemistry, biochemistry and statistics. These are con¬
cerned with ' the examination of normal, as opposed to
abnormal phenomena, which are studied in the sick
person by the clinician and the pathologist.
For future progress clinical medicine must be integrated
with the basic sciences. Many medical problems are in
fact really problems in applied biology, physics, che-

The labyrinth
off
a sick mind
Fortunately, the artist who becomes ill does not lose his
creative ability. This enables the progressive psychiatrist,
using new techniques, to stimulate artistic talents and thereby
gain deeper insight into the sick man's mind. It is not an
accident that the painting reproduced here recalls the work
of Hieronymus Bosch, who was obsessed with the folly and
horror of this world and commented on it in nightmare terms.
The painter, a young Canadian who was familiar with Bosch's
work, did it while he was a patient in a mental hospital in
England. He shows himself lying on stoney ground, his skull
divided into the compartments of a maze from which there
is no escape. Various compartments depict his miserable
childhood, his sympathy for the Ukraine, his mother country,
his disillusionment with political activity, his hopelessness
at ever beiag able to share other people's faith in ¡deal values,
his feelingji of unreality and of estrangement from the sunlit
"normal" world, his frustated sexuality, his fear of imminent
destruction his impulse to cut himself to the bone to see if
he has a sjblid skeleton like other men. The crows represent
doctors viewed in a paranoid light. Below this is a fantasy
of hospital treatment seen as a benevolent conspiracy. In
the centre, at the bottom, he shows how it feels to be the
subject of a clinical conference. The defeated rat that can
find no way out is also himself. It is the work of a hypersen¬
sitive, obsessional patient, a prey to depressive ruminations
and feelings of unreality. His severe inhibitions against
expressing or even admitting positive feelings have prevented
his using his undoubted talents to their fullest advantage.

The surgeon m st understand his patient in his biological
and social setting, his metaboUc and electrolyte balance,
his nutrition and hi respiratory, circulatory, hepatic and
renal functions.
Med.icaJ research is no longer a bedside study separated
from the laboratory. The first half of the~ century
witnessed the disintegration of medicine into spoo1alties.
Now in the second half it·is being reintegrated with other
disciplines derived directly from the basic sciences.
Medical resea.rch is becoming more and more a combined
operation conducted on a wide front. Progress in cardiac
surgery, for example, demands the participation of a team
of experUi versed indifferent disciplines. The study of
-drug addiction needs the co-operation of the pharma­
cologist, biochemist, psychiatrist, criminologist and
sociologist.
There have been political changes in the pattern of
medical research. Atone time this was done ma.1nJly in
the universities, but now it has spread from their confines
and is carried out in hospitals and research institutions
and by organizations sponsored by central government
and intemaJtional organizations, such as the World Health
Organization.
In the past, national gov,ellnments were interested in
medicine mainly -from the preventive aspect. By intro­
ducing the necessary legLslationand a public health se,r­
vice many countries have reduoed the incidence and
morbidity of the major bacterial infections, although
th-ese have to a lesser extent been replaced by virus
infections.
With the changes in the economic structure of maJIlY
parts of the world, t community has had to play an
increasing part in the economics of medicine, pa.rticularly
in the provision of medical care, and the financing of
medical education and research.
As a result of government sponsorship 8;t the
national and international level, attention is
being focused on the study of diseases th Jt were once
oonsidered of minor medical interest. Mental illness and
th chr nic degen rative diseases such as rh umatism,
coronary disease, atherosclerosis and diabetes, are attain­
ing greater prominence in the practice of medicine and
in research programmes. They are of economic impoI'lt­
ance because of the chronic disability thaJt they cause.
Government intervention is aJso c nging the pattern
of medical economics. A whole body of iJ."esearch is
growing up into the economics of the provision of medical
care, and although strictly speaking not a scientific acti­
vity, it is a necessary one.
Another economic trend in medicine that has reper­
cussions on medical research is the gllOWth of health
insurance, which in some countries has glIOWn to such
an ex,tent that there are very few free beds left in public
hospi·tals. This means that there are fewer hospital
patients vailwbleas subjects fo research and teaching.
Furthermore, th i creasing dep ndence of universities on
government funds will result in some of the resear done

nuclear medicine.
Government aid can be of value to medical research
in providirig funds and amenities ,for those projects that

MEDICAL RESEARCH (Cont'd)
Studying man
against his background
With the growth of industrial development In many
countries industrial health and welfare are becoming of
increasing importance, and both government and industry
are concerned with reducing wastage of manpower due to
disease and injury. Many large plants now have rehabili¬
tation schemes for their workers after injury or illness.
The pharmaceutical industry has contributed towards
progress in therapeutics by the discovery of a number of
new and useful drugs. Whereas at one time new drugs
were discovered in university or hospital laboratories,
almost all those marketed in the last fifty years have
come from the laboratories of the pharmaceutical Indus¬
try. This industry is also sponsoring research in the
hospitals and universities on fundamental work.
In recent years there has been a trend towards the
study of man in relation to "his environment. Illness,
particularly mental illness, is being studied against its
social background. If the concept of positive health is to
be pursued many sociological factors must be considered.
Medical education programmes are undergoing modi¬
fication. Medical teachers are going into the under¬
developed countries on an exchange basis to train doctors,
and new medical schools are being built there. The heed
for a close relationship between medical education and
medical research is emphasized in some quarters.
It is now accepted that medical teachers benefit by
undertaking research and similarly the education of the
medical student benefits by carrying out a piece of simple
research. The increasing number of full-time appoint¬
ments in medical schools should give teachers more time
for reflection and research hy relieving them of the
necessity of part-time medical practice outside the
hospital.
The general public is becoming more sickness-conscious
as a result of the medical Information that is now dissem-
CANCER PREVENTION & CONTROL calls for a world-wide
expansion and co-ordination of research, not only to prevent a dupli¬
cation of effort, but because of marked differences in the incidence
of various forms of cancer among different populations. Laboratory
animals, like these mice, are widely used In research work on cancer.

RADIOACTIVE ATOMS are today used both to track down cancer
(radio-isotopes act as "tracers" to locate its site) and to attack cance-
tous tissues. Following exhaustive research, radium, once the main

inated by press, radio and television, although it is often
the more sensational aspects that are stressed. The
patient can no longer be treated in ignorance of his
disease. It should be explained to him in simple terms
and if incurable he should be told how to live with it.
Much disease would be prevented if the layman were
taught the principles of healthy living without producing
hypochondriasis.
With the great reduction in communicable diseases and
with more adequate nutrition there is a resulting increase
in population and increase in length of Ufe. The ultimate
aim of geriatrics which ls concerned with problems of
aging has been summarized as the adding of life to
years and not years to life.
The implications of the longer life are seen when the
expectation of life of 30 years for rural populations in
underdeveloped countries is compared with that of some
other countries of perhaps 70 years. In the latter popula¬
tions there will obviously be many more older people than
in the underdeveloped countries.
In the last decade the problems resulting from this have
come to the fore. They are social, economic and medical.
There is increasing need for older people to be able to
earn at least part of their dayjto-day expenses and even
more to be able to care for themselves as long, as possible.
Much success has been achieved In preventing the elderly
from becoming Immobilized and bed-ridden.
Further work is needed into the understanding of all
aspects of aging and this probably involves studies of
all ages and of the degenerative diseases and cancer.
Experimental research on aging is now being done In
some centres. The varying rates of failure of different
organs with age opens up a wide study of the part
played by environment in its broadest sense and by
genetics. Thus it will be seen that the problems of the
aging will benefit from many aspects of medical research
while their study will in turn contribute to the solution
of other medical problems.

AN S.O.S.
FROM CABLEMAN
TO FISHERMAN
by C. S. Laivlon
DEEP-SEA TRAWLERS with their sea
bed fishing gear have been responsible for
many cuts in international telephonic commu¬
nications through their trawls fouling ocean
cables. It is not uncommon for a cable repair
ship to find a fleet of as many as 40 large
trawlers at work in the area of ocean-bed
cables. Damage occurs in practically every
month of the year and in depths of well
over 200 fathoms (1,200 feet) of water.
Chauffard © Rapho, Paris
E ven In the earliest days of ocean cables, com¬
mercial fishing constituted a hazard, but radi¬
cal developments have come about in both Industries to
so aggravate the situation that now it is causing grave
concern to the communications companies.
Years ago fishing was carried out with hand lines by
small local groups with limited financial resources and
little, if any, government assistance. However, the popu¬
lar realization of the importance of developing this poten¬
tially vast source of food has brought with it great
emphasis by the governments of the world upon basic
research to Improve fishing methods, and the granting of
financial aid to the fishing industry.
The introduction of bottom trawling in the early 1900's
at once increased the hazard, particularly as (instead of
using two ships to keep the net spread between them)
most trawlermen tow the net from a single vessel,
dragging a pair of Otter boards along the bottom attached
to, but in advance of the outer edges of the mouth of
the net.
The safest bottom for a communications cable ls flat
and even, Irregularities cause suspensions across small
concavities. Because cable is inherently stiff and some¬
times has a tendency after having been uncoiled from a
ship's tank to retain a bit of helical springiness, these
suspensions cannot be avoided entirely by laying cable
without residual tension. As a matter of fact, if the
bottom is sufficiently flat and even, better results some¬
times may be achieved by laying it bartlght.
Naturally, if a cable is not resting on bottom at all
points and a trawl board, its lower edge scraping along
the bottom, is towed across It where the cable is sus¬
pended, the probability of fouling is great. Poor main-
tainance of the Iron shoes which sheath the lower edge of
the boards and the bolts which hold them in place, as
well as the shape of the boards themselves and their
attachments, often are contributory factors, but the chief
causes of fouling reside in the cableman's inability to
make cable conform closely to the contour of the sea
bottom and the fisherman's conviction that the boards
cannot be towed off bottom and still function properly.
The fishermen's stock argument runs: "The fish were
here before the cables", but even this "ain't necessarily
so". Fish have a way of migrating from one area to an¬
other with minor changes in water temperature brought
about by shifting currents which carry their food (plank¬
ton) and by the gradual melting of the polar ice caps.
As an instance of the latter, Cape Cod, Massachusetts,
the waters around which were teeming with codfish when
the Cape was named, supports little commercial cod-
flshlng today whereas this fish Ls plentiful in the waters
around southern Greenland, the inhabitants of which
scarcely knew what a codfish looked like sixty years ago.
The advent of refrigeration at sea and the ability to
ship frozen fish inland have revolutionized the fishing
Industry. The number, size and power of trawlers and
the depths in which they operate, all have increased. It
is not uncommon for a cable repair ship to find a fleet
of twenty to forty large trawlers of several nationalities
milling around In a small area on the continental shelf,

### 63563: An S.O.S. from cableman to fisherman
ITU. Geneva
OCEAN-BED TRAWL (above) is a broad net whose
mouth is held apart by a pair of Otter boards which
drag along the bottom of the sea. Some of the modern
trawlers and their gear are so powerful that they can
break the strongest communication cables, in some
cases without even being aware of it. Repairs by cable
ships (right) are costly and time-consuming and cause
major traffic diversions In International communications.
S.O.S. FROM CABLEMAN (Cont'd;
Can two freedoms of the seas' be reconciled?
well over a hundred miles from land, wherever bottom
fish are abundant. The season is limited only by the
presence of heavy field ice. Cable damage occurs in
practically every month of the year and in depths to
well over 200 fathoms of water.
There was a time when a cable could be designed for a
reasonable degree of protection by sheathing it with
heavy wire armor. That day has passed. Some of the
modern trawlers and their gear are so powerful that they
can break the strongest communication cables, in some
cases possibly without even being aware of them. These
cables have tensile strengths on the order of twenty tons
or more but under certain conditions it takes less than
the full tensile strength of a cable to break it.
B ecause two of the basic concepts of the free¬
dom of the seas, the freedom to lay cables and
the freedom to fish, are in serious conflict, the problems
at issue must be resolved on an international basis if
substantial Improvement is to follow.
Efforts have been, and are continuing to be made to
re-design the Otter board. The present bottom trawl is
not an efficient tool in that most of the fish in its path
are able to escape and almost one-third of a trawler's
propulsive effort is absorbed by the friction of the boards
scraping along the ocean bottom. Nevertheless, where
fish are plentiful it Is serving its purpose.
In the past those fishes which inhabit depths Inter¬
mediate between the surface and the sea bottom have
been most difficult to catch (except by hand-lines).
Recently, however, the sciences of "mid-water trawling"
has been the object of considerable research by govern¬
ment agencies and a few private inventors. One product
of this research is the buoyant Otter board which can
be controlled so as to operate off bottom.
Theoretically it should be possible to utilize such boards
with bottom trawls, since the boards are positioned some
distance ahead of the net and a slight upward pull of
22 the boards so positioned should not be enough to lift the
heavy weighted foot-rope of the net off bottom. Their
elevation by as little as a fathom or two would cause them
to ride harmlessly over cables while from the fishermen's
standpoint there would be either a substantial saving in
propulsive effort or a substantial increase in speed of
towing (which improves the chances of catching fish).
Where the bottom is consistently penetrable to a depth
of from 7 to 24 ins. and currents are not too strong for a
surface vessel to manoeuvre, cables have been successfully
buried over distances of about 20 miles in the ocean
bottom across a fishing area ranging in depths between
100 and 450 fathoms of water, but this technique is too
limited in application in the present state of the art to
be of much general assistance.
Research is going forward, however, in the extension to
deeper water of methods utilizing a bottom vehicle,
television-controlled and powered from a surface vessel.
The under-water television camera, with Its ability
actually to photograph cables lying in situ and trawl nets
in action gives scientists a new and powerful tool for
probing these mysteries, but how long It will take to bring
about the desired new techniques of cable laying and
fishing is anyone's guess. They certainly are not
imminent.
Efforts have been made to move cables out of heavily-
fished areas. Ten years ago Western Union moved
several of its transatlantic cables northward off the east
coast of Newfoudland on the advice of government
biologists that the cod would never be found there in
sufficient density to support commercial fishing. It was
known that redfish were there but at that time redfish
were not considered too suitable for the market and when
caught most of them either were thrown back or used
for fertilizer.
Fi rom about 1956, however, as cod became less
plentiful east of Newfoundland and other
nationalities sent their trawling fleets across the ocean to
fish, the lowly redfish, under the more attractive name of
ocean perch, became "socially acceptable" and can now
be purchased in frozen form almost anywhere in the
United States. The result has been that the cable diver-

sions which were costly and time-consuming to make,
afforded only a few years of Immunity from damage.
One of the chief complaints of the trawlermen ls that
unless they have 'the positions of the cables they cannot
very well avoid crossing them, but until quite recently
these positions have had to be kept confidential for
security reasons. However, the wide-spread damage since
the last World War has convinced most governments that
the fishermen already have a fair acquaintance with
cable routes so that not much is to be gained through
continued secrecy.
Now that most of the countries concerned have agreed
to eliminate the security restriction it has been possible
to publish charts for distribution to trawlermen covering
fishing areas where there are cables, showing the route of
each cable but without individual identification as to
owner or terminal points; cables not now In use are
clearly marked, however. '
Every available means is being employed to bring this
matter to the attention of trawler owners, government
officials, and the fishermen themselves and to see that
they are kept fully Informed.
Ihe International Convention accord of March
14, 1884, for the Protection of Submarine
Cables, is evidence that broken cables have been an inter¬
national problem of long standing. The twenty-seven
signatories agreed that anyone who hooked a cable must
sacrifice his gear rather than cut the cable. Cable owners
were required to pay for the lost gear.
Appropriate legislation enacted by the member nations
still is in force but has done little to alleviate the problem.
Before the advent of the botton trawl, ships' anchors
had been the chief cause of cable damage, confining it to
fairly shallow water. But when a fisherman has to
sacrifice a trawl net, complete with Otter boards, he may
well find himself called upon to sacrifice a catch of fish
in the net and, unless he has a spare set of gear on board,
valuable fishing time while he proceeds to port to replace
it. When he returns the fish may not be there, of course.
The- consequential damages (as opposed to the sacrifice
of the fishing gear Itself) are difficult to assess with any
reasonable degree of accuracy and the cable operators
take the view that they cannot be held responsible for
them. Were they to accept responsibility, the way would
be open for fishermen to Ignore the presence of cables
entirely, whereas It ls mast essential from the cable
operators' point of view that tluTe remain some deterrent
to the practice of trawling over cable lines.

### 63563: An S.O.S. from cableman to fisherman
When a fisherman's trawl gets caught on something,
not knowing what he Ls foul of, the natural tendency of
the fisherman Ls to try to free his gear. In doing so, If
it happens that he has hooked a cable, he ls in grave
danger of damaging it electrically, even If he does not
break it entirely. Thus, whether he elects to cut away
his gear and claim damages merely on suspicion of having
hooked a cable, or whether he brings the cable to the
surface and cuts his gear away with the full knowledge
that It ls indeed a cable (thereby still further Increasing
the probability that he has caused damage), the fact
remains that it ls a hazardous practice to tow a bottom
trawl over cable lines.
As an example of what can happen. Western
Union lost four transatlantic cables In twenty-
six hours on February 24 and 25, 1959, three days after
the interruption of TAT 1, the telephone cable laid in 1950
between Canada and Scotland. Six days later (on
March 3) Western Union lost still another. The damage
to the telephone cable Included a tensile break and a cut
less than a mile apart. "Damage to the five Western
Union cables included ten tensile breaks and two Hush
cuts.
These cables are armored with No. 1 HWO galvanized
steel wires which were in good condition. The depth of
water ranged from 170 to 215 fathoms. The telephone
cable was out of use for eight days. Western Union lost
six days on each of two cables, seven on another, eight
on another, and fifty-six on the last one due to an ice
field (on the edge of which the trawler evidently had
been working) moving over the cable, making It
Inaccessible for repair.
The repairs required a total of 43 days of ships' time
and necessitated the remplacement of 19 miles of cable.
The total cost to the cable operators for repairs on UiLs
occasion was about $120 000. Tills, of course, did not
Include the cost of traffic diversions and hire of alternate
facilities where available.
In the first ten months of 19C0 Western Union cables
were Individually Interrupted or made faulty by trawlers
on forty-four occasions, and the telephone cables were
broken on several occasions aLso.
When cable interruptions come singly, suitable fall-back
arrangements can be made to overcome the loss but when
several cables are broken within a matter of a few hours,
such as has happened off Newfoundland repeatedly, there
Ls bound to be disruption of service and long delays in Its
restoration.
Despite the International scope of the problem and the
best efforts of those engaged in telecommunications,
neither of the two recent international conferences on
the Law of the Sea have been able to cope with it, having
been too deeply absorbed in the controversy over the
width of the Territorial Sea. On the other hand, It must
be clear to any serious student of the matter that the
provisions of the 1884 Convention arc ineffectual in
dealing with the situation which confronts us today.
In the early days of radio it was the hope of the fishing
fraternity that this invention would spell the end of
cables and the annoyance which went with them. No
doubt they are pinning their present hope on the develop¬
ment of communication satellites, but from the amount
of money now being Invested In new cable projects and
the extent of these projects it seems like a forlorn hope
lor the Indulgence of this generation of fishermen.

SOLOMON'S TEMPLE WITH

The description of Solomon's Temple In Jerusalem (built about 1,000
years before Christ, but destroyed and reconstructed several times)
has come down to us through passages in the Bible (particularly the
Book of Kings) from the writings of the historian Flavius Josephus
and from the Hebrew texts of the Talmud. Yet when 17th century
drawings were made of it on the basis of these texts under the direction
of a famed English theologian, Bryan Walton, who was well versed
in Hebrew, Latin and Greek, the result was the astonishing building
(above) of well-defined mid- 1 7th century appearance, standing on a
kind of enormous pedestal (below). Thanks to present-day historical,
archaeological and ethnographical knowledge we are now familiar
with the things that once existed whereas the 17th century analysts
of the ancient texts knew only the meaning of words. Right, a drawing

TRANSLATORS
WORDS AND THINGS
by Georges Mounin
TODAY, when translators are becoming almost
as essential a feature in the smooth-running
office as stenographers, foreign languages are, generally
speaking, learned at school. Since the XVIth century, at
least In Europe, this procedure has been so automatic
that it has destroyed any notion that languages might be
properly learned In any other way. Other methods are
looked on as incomplete and suited at best for training
amateurs or rough translators; they are accepted in the
absence of anything better. The system still regarded as
ideal is to learn foreign languages at school. Students
may be advised to live abroad for a time but this ls
treated as an optional addition to help in acquiring a
good pronunciation (since nowadays we have records and
the radio).
This attitude, linked to the development of school edu¬
cation in modern Europe, has completely transformed our
concept of the operation involved In translating. What
we learn at school is a foreign language so that if we ask
what is the essential and adequate requirement for a good
translator we are told that he must have as sound a
knowledge as possible of the language to be translated.
Those who know somewhat more about the subject will
add that he should have a still better knowledge of the
language into which he proposes to translate.
This development of the study of languages has resulted
in the loss along the way of an old view of translation
which was vigorously urged up to the time of the Renais¬
sance: merely knowing the words ls not enough In trans¬
lating, it is also essential to know the things referred to
in the text to be translated.
This was the view held by Cicero who contrasted trans¬
lation of sense with translation of words; it was the view
held by the French philologist, Etienne Dolet, who laid
down as the prime condition of any good translation a
knowledge of the sense and content of the text; it is the
well-established view held by Interpreters who contend
that In Interpreting Russian statements at a congress on
organic chemistry, for example, while It Is Important to
know Russian It Is still more Important to know about
organic chemistry.
This old view shatters the routine conception of trans¬
lation. It emphasizes, for Instance, that "knowing Latin"
signifies two quite durèrent things: It means knowing the
Latin words and Latin grammar but it also means know¬
ing the realities of Latin life which ls very dllferent from
our present reality to which those words refer us.
Translation of a text In a foreign language calls for
fulfilment not of one but of two conditions. Both are
essential and neither is sufficient by Itself: a knowledge
of the language and a knowledge of the civilization with
which the language deals (i.e. the life, the culture, the
most complete ethnography of the people who use that
language as their means of expression).
It Is not enough to study a language in order to be able
to translate It well. What ls needed ls a study not by
way of supplement but as a basic foundation and not
haphazardly but systematically of the culture corres¬
ponding to the language concerned. Stays abroad, for
example, are not a minor optional addition to the equip¬
ment of a good translator; they represent half of his
knowledge.
The suggestion that linguistic knowledge, however per¬
fect, ls not enough to ensure good translation may seem
paradoxical or banal but It can be verified almost
experimentally and in a way which ls perhaps Itself no
less paradoxical.
In 1653, the Cambridge theologian, Bryan Walton,
published the Biblia Sacra Polyglotta In Hebrew, Chai- 25
dean, Greek, Samaritan, Syriac, Arabic, Ethiopian, Per¬
sian and Latin. In the first volume was a Latin "Triple

Freakish animals & botanical blunders
Description" of the Temple of Salomon, based on Holy
Writ, Josephus and the Talmud. The author, a Saumur
theologian, compared the three texts and analysed each
Indication of shape, position or dimensions relating to the
Temple so as to reconstruct a picture of the building.
This Professor of Hebrew knew almost as much Hebrew,
Greek and Latin as we know today and read the texts
fairly accurately. Yet when his forty-page commentary
was given to the illustrator of the volume (undoubtedly
under the direction of Walton himself) an astonishing
picture emerged simply from a reading of the words com¬
prising his text: the Temple of Solomon, carefully por¬
trayed in accordance with the trilingual text, looks like
any English or French building in 1650. Some indefinable
element belonging to the
period leads one to think of
St. Paul's Cathedral In
London or the Place des
Vosges in Paris.
What had happened?
The translators had done a
good job of translation,
had read the words of the
text correctly. The fact
that they saw a sort of
Louis XIV edifice where we
imagine Phoenician or Ba¬
bylonian architecture Is
because we know things
where they only knew
words. No doubt we can
read Hebrew a little better
than Walton was able to
do; but, above all, we know
the whole protohistorical
archaeology and ethnogra¬
phy of Asia Minor with
which they were un¬
acquainted. Bit by bit, we
have discovered the things
referred to by words which,

The Idea of using illus-
strators of a text to check
the element of linguistic
knowledge and the element
of ethnographic and/or
cultural knowledge needed
for translation is justifield
by the fact that. In respect
of a description, the illus¬
tration is actually a re-
translation of the words of
the text. If the illustrator
is not directly acquainted with the thing described, then
he only translates whatever has been provided by linguistic
knowledge; we can thereby measure the contribution made
by a cultural knowledge of the things themselves. There
are other striking examples of the proof of this measure.

Biblical errors. Throughout
history translators appear to
have stumbled over correct
botanical Identifications of the
more than ISO flowers, fruits,
trees, shrubs and herbs men¬
tioned In the Bible. We now
know that "the lilies of the
field" (Luke 12.27) were In
reality anemones (right). When
the Prophet Isaiah (35: 1,2)
declared "the desert shall re¬
joice, and blossom as the rose,"
he was actually alluding (say
present-day philologists and bo¬
tanists) to the Narcissus (above).

or example, paleontology revealed that there
once existed in Patagonia huge edentate crea¬
tures like the Megatherium which, when standing on its
hind legs, was taller than an elephant. For a long time
it was believed that these types of giant Sloth were fossils.
Then a series of discoveries of recent bones, skins and
excremential matter together with Araucanian or Pata-
gonian legends referring to the recent existence of a
harmless but invulnerable grubbing animal, hairy and of
terrifying appearance, led to the suspicion that some
species of Megatherium, far fom being extinct since the
Tertiary period, might possibly have survived almost up
to the present time.
A search was accordingly made for references to its
existence in the accounts written by early XVIth century
travellers. Among those consulted was Father Thévet's
Singularités de la France Antarctique (1558). This work
contained a remarkable description of a creature referred
to as a succarath, readily and conclusively identified with
some sort of giant fossil Sloth such as the Mylodon, a
close relation of the Megatherium, and possessing a long
tall. When it was being hunted, according to Father
Thévet, the animal would carry its young on its back and
protect them with Its long thick tail.
Since he considered the creature "very strange In
appearance", the explorer decided to include a drawing
of it in his book and it is this which makes the story
interesting from the translator's point of view.
B ERNARD Heuvelmans, from whom all the pre¬
sent details are taken (1), writes that "the
naïve picture accompanying this text shows a sort of very
thin lion with a tail like the bushy appendage of an ant-
eater and a grotesque head with a certain resemblance to
a bearded man. At least four or five little ones are
huddled on the creature's back.
"It is more than likely that the drawing was made not
by an eye-witness but in accordance with another per¬
son's description, as was customary at that period. It is
this which explains the frequent distortions in illustra¬
tions of animals which none the less seem to be correctly
described in the text..."
Here is a striking exam¬
ple of what results from a
translation of words un¬
accompanied by a trans¬
lation of things. The illus¬
trator (who had not seen
the animal) translated lite¬
rally what Father Thévet's
words, and nothing but
those words, meant to him.
The difference between his
engraving and the recons¬
truction of the Megathe¬
rium (carried out by a
Twentieth century artist
with the help of all our
present knowledge in zoo¬
logy and paleontology) in¬
dicates the difference bet¬
ween linguistic knowledge
(words without things) and
cultural knowledge (words
together with the things
to which they refer).
This view of translation
as a double operation (in which the acquisition of the
meaning of certain words by means of other words is
not enough) indicates the legitimacy of another para¬
doxical demonstration. Suppose that we were told that
the glazed brick dragons (known as sirrouches) at the
Ishtar Gate in Babylon were very probably some sort of
dinosaur and not imaginary monsters "hétéroclite com¬
positions of parts taken from four or five different
creatures" we would take this to be simply a journalistic
invention.
Yet such is not the case. The famous "scaly quadruped
with the front feet of a lion, the hind feet of an eagle,
the head of a serpent on a long neck, a forked tongue and
on the top of his head, a long horn, various fleshy excre¬
scences and even a short -mane like a horse" must be a
portrayal of some animal which actually existed. -
If the Ishtar Gate had been uncovered in 1802 instead
of 1902, says the zoologist Willie Ley, then the Babylonian

Animals.") Vol. 11, pp. 3-53, Pans, Plön, 1955.

The succarath, the strange animal shown
on right, was described In great detail
by a 1 6th century French priest, Father
Thévet, when he wrote one of the first
books about the natural history of
North America. Whereas a drawing
made at that time on the basis of Father
Thévet's description produced the freak¬

zoology has conclusively Identified the

such as the Mylodon, perhaps now

From "Sur la Piste des Bêtes Ignorées"
Babylons dragon was a real African reptile
dragon would have been taken for a mythological animal;
but, during the XlXth century, the great fossil family of
dinosaurs was discovered, Including one particular group,
the Ornithopoda, which has the hind feet of a bird like
the Ishtar dragon. As early as 1918, the archaeologist,
Koldewey, recognized that if a creature resembling this
dragon were to be met with in nature, its place would be
in the order of Dinosaursand that the Iguanadon of the
Belgian Cretaceous period would be its closest relative.
Koldewey went no further than that but Willie Ley has
found the most plausible explanation so far of the pre¬
sence of this sort of Iguanadon or Ceratosaurus on the
walls of Babylon: we may be dealing with a monster,
reaching a length of some 36 feet, whose existence is still
affirmed to this day throughout the Congo basin.
H
28
ere again, Heuvelmans has scrupulously
supplied the quasi-experimental "translation"
operations whereby a rare African reptile became the
Babylonian sirrouch: the artists of the Ishtar Gate
reconstructed the dragon in accordance with accounts
given by travellers who had seen it (Babylonian travels to
the centre of Africa are a well-attested fact). It was a
linguistic description which provided the model and
supplied the basis for the styllzation which resulted in
the monster:
"If you doubt the validity of this", says Heuvelmans,
"I suggest the following experiment. Ask someone who
has never seen a reconstruction of a dinosaur a child,
for instance to draw an animal in accordance with the
foregoing sketch of the Congolese 'dragon'. There ls a
strong probability that this person will draw a creature
with a remarkable resemblance to the sirrouch of the
Ishtar Gate.
"He will first draw a quadruped with the shape of some
familiar animal (a horse, a dog, a bull or a cat), and will
then, following your indications, add a long tail and the
head and neck of a snake. When you mention the clawed
feet, he will undoubtedly draw the feet of a lion or a cat.
Then he will place on the creature's head the various fea¬
tures which you specify: the small horn and the crest of
tentacles. Finally when you make it clear that the crea¬
ture is a reptile, he will cover the body with scales.
Except for the hind feet, this will result in a very accep¬
table sirrouch."
Bernard Heuvelmans' analysis shows, us how, through a
series of linguistic "translations" followed by a series of
pictorial "translations", a species of Ceratosaurus became
the Babylonian dragon. When we follow the same series
in the opposite direction, we can fairly consider the Baby¬
lonian creature as presumptive evidence for the existence
of the African Ceratosaurus.
These curious linguistic "experiments" may seem far
removed from the concern of translators but they illus¬
trate, experimentally, the very ancient idea (and, in Its
scientific form, the very new idea) that words do not
take the place of things like synthetic rubber replacing
natural rubber. Linguistic signs do not wholly replace the
things they designate, they refer us to those things.
Speaker and listener, or author and reader, must jointly
carry out this journey from thing to sign and from sign
to thing if they are to understand each other.
At its most difficult, the whole work of the
translator consists precisely of trying to give
his readers some idea of the inaccessible things discussed
in a text written in a foreign language and alluding to a
culture which is often also foreign, either In part or in
whole. To give people in the Tropics an idea of winter
and snow; to explain the parable of the Good Sower to
inhabitants of the New Mexico deserts who plant and
watch over their seeds one by one; or even to convey to
French readers that, the Federal Trade Commission or the
Interstate Commerce Commission in the United States
have nothing in common with any ministerial or parlia¬
mentary trade commission in France: these are tasks as
skilled and as difficult as discovering the Megatherium
which is undoubtedly hidden behind Father Thévet's
Succarath or the Ceratosaurus which is probably con¬
cealed by the sirrouch of the Ishtar Gate.
The translator must not be satisfied with merely being
a good linguist, he must also be an excellent anthropo¬
logist; and this amounts to saying that he must not only
know all about the language he is translating but also
all about the people who use that language. And he
thereupon becomes a prestidigitator, a magician, the high
priest of an eighth art.

### 63566: Students abroad in search of knowledge
STUDENTS ABROAD
IN SEARCH OF KNOWLEDGE
by Gordon Behrens
SiiInce ancient times, students have been on
'the move in search of knowledge. In the sixth
century B.C., oriental scholars flocked to the Kingdom of
Lu to listen to the scholarly lectures of Confucius. The
court of the Indian king, Vikramldltya II, in the golden
age of Sanskrit literature drew scholars from as far away
as China and the Near East. The famous Academy In
Athens where Plato taught and the school of Aristotle
drew students from three continents to these ancient
centres of learning.
Europe's medieval universities like Cracow, Prague and
Paris were magnets which brought students from every
corner of Europe. In the 14th century, the forty colleges
of the University of Paris attracted students from every
country in Europe.
The trek of students from one country to another to
further their academic ambitions ls as old as history, but
until fairly recent times such study abroad was motivated
primarily by a student's desire to find the best schools of
higher learning and the best teachers available in his
field. Needless to say, he paid for it out of his own pocket.
Within the last few decades, the whole concept of study
abroad has been revolutionized. Governments, inter¬
governmental organizations, private agencies and inter¬
national organizations have recognized that the exchange
of students is one of the positive ways to promote better
understanding between countries and to help break down
those prejudices and misconceptions which distance, lan¬
guage, race and customs may create between peoples.
More recently, the exchange of students has been
viewed as an important way in which developing coun
tries, lacking trained personnel, can educate and train
their young people In skills and knowledge acquired
abroad, thus permitting them to make a greater contribu¬
tion to the economic and social growth of their own
countries.
Transportation and cost have always been the pro¬
hibiting factors in the free How of students from one
country to another. In this age of the jet aeroplane,
getting there ls easily solved, but paying for It amounts
today to a four-figure sum that only a handful of students
can afford. The medical student from Thailand who
wishes to continue his work In a specialized Held in
Vienna, or the Bolivian engineering student who wants
to study hydraulics in the United States, has to spend
practically a year's tuition and living costs In transporta¬
tion before he ever sets foot on the campus of his choice.
Realizing the benefits of student exchanges as well a.s
the prohibitive costs involved, more and more govern¬
ments and other organizations, both private and Inter¬
national, have awarded fellowships, scholarships, grants
and other forms of financial aid to enable deserving stu¬
dents to travel and study abroad. A Unesco survey esti¬
mates that there were, In 1960, a total of 200,000 students
studying In countries other than their own. Of this
number almost one-half were being helped by awards
from a vast variety of government, private and Inter¬
national sources.
Unesco has, from Its Inception, taken a great Interest
In the programme of the exchange of persons throughout
the world. In 1947 the Exchange of Persons service was
established and one of its first tasks was to catalogue
the great number of fellowships, scholarships and other

115,000 study awards in 113 countries
British Council, London
awards available throughout the world for students who
wish to study abroad.
This job had never been done before on an international
scale. In 1949 Unesco produced Volume I of Study Abroad,
listing 15,000 awards for students to study abroad made
by 281 agencies in 34 countries. Today in its 13th edition,
"Study Abroad" lists more than 115,000 awards available
from 1,652 agencies, institutions and governments in
113 states and territories..
Study Abroad has now become one of Unesco's biggest
"best sellers". It is now looked upon as a veritable bible
of fellowship information by students, educators and
scientists, as well as government and private agencies.
"Dog-eared" copies are consulted by scores of students
throughout the world in the offices of government educa¬
tional counsellors, university libraries and a host of pri¬
vate and public organizations which help students who
are looking for opportunities to continue their academic
work in foreign countries.
T;
30
he latest volume covering the academic year
1962 shows that awards available for study in
foreign lands ase most numerous in the fields of applied
science, social sciences (including education), natural
sciences, mathematics and humanities. But this general
breakdown does not begin to probe the scope and breadth
and unusual character of many awards waiting to be
claimed by some deserving student.
Ten young star-gazers, for example, can continue their
work in astronomy for a three-to six-month period in
a country where the telescopes are more powerful than at
home through a travel grant offered by the International
Astronomical Union. The Associated Country Women of
the World provide an all-expense one-year study abroad
for a young woman interested in studying practical nutri¬
tion, adult education, home and country crafts, or family
welfare. The International Union of Students picks
25 students each year for three to six-year courses in
a University of the U.S.S.R. in the fields of science, medi¬
cine and agronomy. All expenses are paid and an addi
tional grant is available for students from tropical lands
to buy warm clothing.
Over four per cent of all awards offered for study abroad
in the latest Unesco edition are for fellowships, scholar¬
ships and other grants-in-aid made by the United Nations
and its family of specialized agencies (including Unesco).
Future atomic scientists, bankers-to-be and budding
economists are among the recipients of the UN's annual
legacy for study abroad. Farmers, fishermen, meteorolo¬
gists, aviation mechanics and labour relations experts
can also find programmes listed for foreign study by the
UN.'s specialized agencies.
Unesco's own programme for study abroad lists more
than a dozen fields ranging from education to natural and
social sciences, cultural activities, information media,
petroleum research and the training of journalists.
One of Unesco's newest exchange programmes is for
women adult education workers, to provide a travel grant
to enable women active in their own countries in women's
organizations to travel abroad and see what is being done
in other countries by similar organizations. During the
current year, twenty women sponsored by international
women's groups holding consulting status with Unesco
will benefit from this Unesco travel grant. A woman from
Fiji will visit New, Zealand, a Japanese women's leader
will visit the United States and four Scandinavian coun¬
tries, another from Kenya will be visiting the U.K., and
a Northern Rhodesian, Australia. A Nepalese will go to
Sierra Leone and two women from Argentina and Peru
will visit three European countries.
Although international organizations account for an
ever-growing number of awards and opportunities for
foreign study (14%) individual governments still account
for almost fifty per cent of the scholarships and fellow¬
ships and other grants offered to students in Unesco's
latest edition of Study Abroad. Educational groups
account for about 20 per cent of the awards with foun¬
dations, clubs, private groups, etc., making up the balance.
Most awards listed in the Unesco annual are unrestric-
tlve as to eligibility, that ls, who can participate. About
a third of the awards, however, stipulate that a student
receiving the grant be a resident or citizen of one parti-

### 63566: Students abroad in search of knowledge
cular region or country. Another two-thirds stipulate that
the award is for study in a specific country or Institution
of higher learning.
Some awards specify the precise field in which the
exchange student must study, but a fair number (about
one quarter) let the student choose his own field of Inte¬
rest. In those awards which do specifically define the field
of study, applied sciences lead the field with about 20 per
cent, social sciences 14 per cent, mathematics 10 per cent
with liberal arts, humanities, philology, art, culture, his¬
tory, librarianship, museology, etc., accounting for the
rest.
Thousands of fellowships are offered to students of par¬
ticular ethnic origin, countries, regions or continents.
One small college in the midwestern United States, for
example, offers six scholarships every year two to Latin
Americans, two to Africans and two to Asians. A univer¬
sity in Iceland offers a scholarship to a student from the
U.S.A. of Icelandic background and one to a Norwegian,
while a university in Norway offers, through its students'
organization, a year's scholarship to a student from
the U.S.S.R.
Needs of the African students in the newly
Independent countries who keenly desire to
continue their studies in foreign countries, have received
immediate recognition from many countries and awarding
agencies. In a special supplement to Study Abroad
published only a few months ago. Unesco lists 10,000
opportunities for foreign study available to African stu¬
dents made by 136 agencies in 54 countries. Awards are
open to students from 35 African states and territories.
The demand for this document entitled Fellowships for
Africans has been so great that It has already gone
through a second printing.
In addition to numerous awards from international
organizations, countries like the U.S.A., the U.S.S.R., the
United Kingdom, France and Belgium, list hundreds of
scholarships available for undergraduate students to
study in the universities of their respective countries in
any field of their choice.
Private agencies olfer interesting and unusual oppor¬
tunities in a variety of fields. The British Red Cross
Society grants two Florence Nightingale scholarships to
nurses from Commonwealth countries In Africa. Nine
young musicians chosen from Ghana, Kenya and the
Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland can receive scho¬
larships to music academics In Great Britain sponsored by
the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, and
some aspiring student of cinematography from the Repub¬
lic of Somalia can receive a 20-month course in Rome
at the expense of the Italian Government. A considerable
number of scholarships are offered by African countries
themselves for students from neighbouring countries.
In connexion with Study Abroad, Unesco has under¬
taken nine separate annual surveys of students studying
in countries other than their own. The surveys have
included not only scholarship and fellowship students but
also those who are studying on their own. The results of
the surveys are startling. They show that almost two
per cent of all the world's students In higher education
are taking their studies abroad. The total figure is
200,000 and this number ls viewed as even more significant
in the light of the fact that a high proportion of these
students will probably occupy positions of great impor¬
tance in the economic, political and social development of
their own countries.
About 50,000 of the world's students studying abroad
are enrolled In institutions of higher learning In the Uni¬
ted States, although the percentage of foreign students In
the U.S.A. in relation to the total number of students in
higher education ls below the world average. The Federal
Republic of Germany, France, the United Kingdom and
the U.S.S.R. each have more than 10,000 foreign students
enrolled in their colleges and universities. Argentina has
almost that number with a total of 9,269 students from
abroad. Japan counts almost 4,500 students from abroad
and in Switzerland and Austria where foreign students
are fewer in number, they still make up approximately
one-third of the total number enrolled In universities and
colleges.

tries, Unesco found that in 12, more than half of the
students came from only three or four foreign countries.
The study showed, for example, that in Japan, 59 per
cent of the foreign students were from Korea and 25 per
cent from China. The United Kingdom counts 19 per cent
from Its non-self-governing territories, 12 per cent from
India, 9 per cent from U.S.A., and 8 per cent from Nigeria.
Switzerland has 20 per cent of its foreign students from
Germany (1), 13 per cent from the U.S.A. and 9 per cent
from France.
In some countries and territories the percentage of
foreign students ls almost on a par with the country's
own student enrollment. Trinidad and Tobago, for ins¬
tance, have 66 foreign students and only 77 native enrolled
studentsa staggering 85 per cent of foreign students as
compared with the U.S.S.R. which has about 0.5 per cent
of its student population from abroad, and the U.S.A.
with 1.4 per cent.
The Unesco survey shows that more than a quarter of
foreign students studying outside their own countries are
following courses in the humanities, education and fine
arts. Not quite another quarter are taking courses in
engineering. Law and social sciences occupy about 17 per
cent and natural sciences a little more than 10 per cent.
Medicine, formerly one of the most popular reasons for
study abroad, now accounts for about 15 per cent of the
total foreign student population.

his survey made by Unesco helps to provide
agencies and governments with a clear idea of
what sort of scholarships are needed and what they can
best offer to achieve effective results for the money they
provide. Here can be found, both in the documentation
of awards available for study abroad and the survey of
students presently studying abroad which Unesco has
compiled, the clue to problems which exist in this field in
its modern forms.
Unesco has summed it up like this:
"Study abroad is widely recognized as having many
valuable uses. It can give the individual student the
diploma or the experience he needs. It can influence the
international development of the specialized field in which
he is studying. It can further the aims of the organiza¬
tion giving the scholarship which enables him to study
abroad. It can train personnel for employment in projects
for social and economic development. It can spread the
knowledge of certain languages and cultures in other
countries. It can be one of the most effective ways of
breaking down individual prejudices against people in
other lands, thereby encouraging a better understanding
among the nations between which exchanges are made.
"Study abroad can be an adventure in learning but it
can also be an adventure which puts a strain upon the
student. Strange methods of instruction and living con¬
ditions can affect his power to learn. Other things may
test his power of adaptation" (2).
Unesco seeks solutions to these problems through the
Information which it is constantly collecting from the
donors of awards to students for study abroad and from
the surveys made of students in foreign lands. It is
undoubtedly true that the student abroad faces problems
and challenges which his colleague at home escapes, but
what he faces in effect, are those problems and challenges
which face all persons going abroad to learn something of
other men's ways.

USE WORLD'S SURPLUS FOOD
Sir,
Much has been said and written
about the problem of food and peo¬
ple. Surplus food does not reach
countries where it is needed mainly
for political and economic reasons.
The Food and Agriculture Organiza¬
tion of the United Nations could play
a great part in breaking this deadlock
by creating a branch whose job
would be to buy up surplus food
and distribute it where most needed.
It should request food exporting
countries to contribute a certain per¬
centage of their production at a
fixed rate to the "pool". But the
distribution of this food should not
be free unless circumstances demand¬
ed it.

educated me about a man of whose
life and work and background I knew
so little. The world, and I mean all
the world including its politicians
could benefit from his teachings.
When will the world produce an¬

Sir,
I have been waiting for you to de¬
vote one issue to "Tagore and his
mission", as the world has just cele¬

view you have not done justice to
such a great saint, not only of India
but of the whole world who has
also contributed much towards world
peace. Apart from this there are
many other subjects of Asian coun¬
tries which should find place in your
magazine.

Sir,
Unesco must not confine itself to
problems of education science and
culture in isolation from the struggle
to maintain peace and prevent war.
At the present moment Unesco must
do everything possible to lessen the
tension existing in the world. This can
best be done through the publication
in The Unesco Courier of articles by
statesmen, scientists and plain people
from all parts of the world who desire
to maintain peace and live without the
constant threat of war. The most
effective method of preserving peace
is the complete disarmament of all
nations, something that .'ill people in
all countries agree with.
You should publish a number of
articles devoted to a demonstration of
the materia] values that mankind could
acquire by releasing the gigantic re¬
sources now being wasted on arma¬
ments, of the wonderful projects for
the transformation of the face of
our planet which could be put into
effect for the benefit of all mankind
and for the improvement of living stan¬
dards of all peoples.
It is interesting to peruse an entire
issue devoted to Velasquez or the pre¬
servation of the monuments of ancient
Egypt, but the problem of the struggle
for peace must also find its place in
your columns, for there may occur a
terrible catastrophe from which there
will be no recovery, and then there
will be no Velasquez pictures and no
one to see and enjoy them.

FATHER & SON
Sir,
I should like to point out that the
photograph of Commander Adrien de
Gerlache (published in the portrait
gallery "Trail Blazers of Antarctica",
January issue) was, in fact a photo¬
graph of me (his son). The mistake
no doubt arose from the fact that
I also led a Belgian expedition to the
Antarctic, but in 1957, not 1897. My
account of the expedition was publish¬
ed under the title, Retour dans I'An¬
tarctic (Return to the Antarctic) and
included photographs of us both.
There is a certain resemblance bet¬
ween us, but not enough for one of
us to be mistaken for the other. I
must say I was surprised to find my¬
self in the company of Capt. James
Cook and Jules Dumont d'Urville.

BIBLIOGRAPHIES, PLEASE
Sir,
I read The Unesco Courier corres¬
pondence column with much interest
and welcome any friendly controversy
it may raise. Nothing h:is raised so
much controversy as reader eilorts to
improve the Iùlitor's choice! Now I
should like to add my co.il to the fire.
As a Geography specialist I quite
naturally favour scientific geographi¬
cal articles of advanced text. How¬
ever, as I am resigned to the fact that
these and simihir articles are rather
rare, I make the following appeal,
All articles, irrespective of subject
matter, should include a comprehen¬
sive and authoritative bibliography as
a guide to more advanced study. In
this way the "general treatment" of
subject is preserved yet the specialist
is succoured.

Sir,
Your remarkable issues on racism
-and the temples of Abu Simbel (1960)
pursuaded me to renew my subscrip¬
tion. In the issues of the past year
I found nothing of interest to compare
with these. With the exception of
your issues on Africa and Art in the
Life of Man, I was disappoinlcd by
what I read, and consider that at the
present time there arc subjects far
more vital to friendship and under¬
standing between peoples than the
ones you chose.

DIVORCED FROM REALITIES
Sir,
The September 1961 issue of The
Unesco Courier (Africa's Wild Life in
Peril) was such a shock in its fan¬
tastic divorcement from the realities
of life at the time, so remote from the
crucial problems confronting the peo¬
ple of the world, that we could only
throw our hands up in bewildered dis¬
gust. But we arc somewhat appeased
that you put in the brilliant and appro¬
priate cartoons of Cram (Marc Alcu).
The fact that he comes from Spain, of
all places, intensifies the pleasure.

ONE THEME ISSUES
Sir,
There have been so many editions
over the past two years which have
no interest for me because of the
deplorable practice of devoting whole
issues to one topic. Your journal is
supposed to cater for those interested
in the arts, in science, in education.
Why therefore devote whole issues
to one of these? A sensible journal
would contain variety.

of readers will find our new editorial
policy of publishing a greater variety
of articles to their taste.

From the Unesco New
|T NESCO-MINDED JAPAN: A photo-
graphic exhibition prepared in Japan
by the Japanese National Commission for
Unesco illustrates the interest in Unesco's
activities aroused among all sections of the
community. The photographs show work
being done all over the country in schools,
Unesco Clubs, and during cultural and edu¬
cational events to make known the aims
of Unesco, of which Japan became a mem¬
ber ten years ago.
un ASSBOOK' FOR EXHIBITS: The
M. Customs Co-operation Council in
Brussels (28 member nations) in consulta¬
tion with GATT (General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade) and Unesco, has creat¬
ed a special passbook or "carnet" which
allows equipment and goods for display
purposes or equipment needed for radio,
TV and film production to enter a foreign
country on a temporary basis. Duties on
the goods are assessed, but are not pay¬
able providing the goods return to their
country of origin after a specified time.
COMPUTER SERVICE AVAILABLE:
The newly established International
Computation Centre in Rome will be able
to offer computer services to its member
states and to U.N. agencies this year.
This was stated at the recent first Gene¬
ral Assembly of the Centre at Unesco
House, in Paris, when approval was given
to the 1962 programme which includes re¬
search into such problems as the unifying
of "languages" used by computers and the
awarding of fellowships to train specialists.
ART SLIDES OF RUSSIAN ICONS:
The 11th and latest series of Unesco
Art Slides in colour present a collection of
works representing the essential aspects of
the Russian ¡con from the 12th to the 16th
century. These colour slides aim to bring
within reach of a wide public reproductions
of important but still little-known world
art masterpieces. With each set comes
an explanatory booklet in English, French
and Spanish. Prices vary from country to
country, but do not exceed the equivalent
of $10 in local currency.
CENTRE FOR ASIA'S EDUCATORS:
A regional centre for training educa¬
tional planners and administrators a
Unesco-aided project will open in New
Delhi, India later this year. Preparatory
to its creation, representatives of Asian
states have recently been meeting in New
Delhi on Unesco's invitation to study
Asia's most urgent educational problems
and to prepare programmes and curricula
for the centre. Surveys made in 15 Asian
countries showed that nearly 90 million
school-age children are still without classes.
AGAINST DISCRIMINATION IN
EDUCATION: The Convention
Against Discrimination in Education adopt¬
ed in December 1960 by delegates of
Unesco's Member States will come into
force on May 22, three months after its
acceptance by the Central African Repu¬
blic the third member state, after France
and Israel, to accept or ratify the conven¬
tion. It implements the Universal Decla¬
ration of Human Rights which asserts the
principle of non-discrimination and the
right of every person to education.
SITEEL SMELTING BY REMOTE
CONTROL: During a recent experi¬
ment made by the Ukrainian Academy of
Sciences, the smelting of steel at the Dnic-
34 prodzerzhinsk Steel Works was controlled
from a computing centre in Kiev, 300 miles
away. The computer received signals as
soon as the smelting began and its pre-set
programme enabled it to collect and ana¬
lyse information as the operation developed
until, at the moment the steel was ready
for pouring, it gave the necessary com¬
mand.
LONG-RANGE MIGRANTS: Austra¬
lian scientists in Canberra recently
received 40 banded birds from Chile in
South America where they had flow from
Macquerie Island in the Antarctic a dis¬
tance of almost 6,000 miles. Since 1953,
when the Commonwealth Scientific and
Industrial Research Organization began
to gather information on the movement
and migration of birds, nearly 200,000
birds of more than 260 species have been
banded in an area ranging from New
Guinea to Antarctica.
MINERAL GEMS ON VIEW: A
giant jewel box containing speci¬
mens of over 70 per cent of the world's
known minerals is to be built this year at
the Royal Ontario Museum in the Univer¬
sity of Toronto, Canada. The collection
will include gems, gold nuggets, crystal clus¬
ters and brilliantly coloured minerals which
will be enhanced by dramatic lighting
effects, contrasted against a darkened gal¬
lery.
rPPSALA PHYSICS SEMINAR: The
University of Uppsala, Sweden, is
organizing an International Seminar for
Research and Education in Physics this
year. Co-sponsored by the International
Atomic Energy Agency, Unesco and the
Central Committee for Swedish Technical
Assistance, it is open to non-European stu¬
dents and scientists, mainly from the deve¬
loping countries, who will be able to take
part in experimental research work in a
field of physics and learn about the orga¬
nization of research projects, physical labo¬
ratories and the teaching of graduate and
undergraduate students. Applications for
attending the course (Sept. 1962-July 1963)
should be sent to International Seminar,
Institute of Physics, University of Uppsala,
Sweden, and should arrive not later than
April 15, 1962.
i¥|IGH DAM OVER NUBIA': The
far-reaching effects of the building
of the Aswan Dam and the new High Dam
are dealt with in "High Dam Over Nubia"
by Leslie Greener, just published in New
York. In addition to reviewing the archae¬
ological and historical losses, the author
describes the efforts now being made to
preserve as much as possible of the area,
including Unesco's campaign to save the
temples of Abu Simbel and Philae, among
other archaeological treasures.
E
ELECTRONIC ZOO TOURS: By
inserting a key into a small box, young
visitors to the Bronx Zoo in New' York
can listen to a short talk about some of
the animals there. There are 40 "talkie"
boxes at various points around the Zoo,
each containing a tape-recorded talk by a
member of the staff giving anecdotes, infor¬
mation and general zoological background
facts about the different animals.
LECTRICITY FROM THE SEA:
Soviet engineers plan to produce elec¬
tricity by using the action of tides in the
Barents Sea. The power station they plan
to build will be an experimental one with
a capacity of 1,200 kws, located at
Kisleguba, northwest of Murmansk. Tide
levels in the Barents Sea can have diffe¬
rences of up to 35 ft. In slack periods
turbines will be kept working by water
from a reservoir.

A BOY SPEAKS FOR ALL BLIND PEOPLE
This statuette, entitled "I Want Eyes", is the work of a blind Japanese
boy, Shigeru Uchikawa. Though only eight years old, Shigeru has
expressed with dramatic intensity his hope to see the world one day,
despite the failure of one operation to restore his sight. He is a pupil
of Shiro Fukurai (left) a sculptor-teacher at the municipal school for
the blind at Kobe, Japan, who helps his pupils to have confidence and
pursue a purpose through art. Of some 650,000 blind children in the
world, only about 40,000 are in school. Over two-thirds of the world's
10 million blind could have preserved their sight had they benefited
in time from modern preventative medicine and surgery. The theme
for this year's World Health Day on April 7 is "Preserve Sight".
