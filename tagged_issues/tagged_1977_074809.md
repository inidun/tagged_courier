The blue idol
Carved in wood and painted blue, this head surmounting an emblematic pole
(3 metres high) is typical of the traditional art of the New Hebrides in Oceania.
Such sculptures, together with huge, elongated statues, were often placed near
or inside Melanesian dwellings, bringing age-old myths, memories of ancestors,
and the world of the gods into everyday life.

### 46531: Towards a new world order; a document without precedent in UNESCO's history: the Medium-term Plan, 1977-1982
TOWARDS
A NEW WORLD ORDER
A document without precedent
in Unesco's history :
the Medium-Term Plan (1977-1982)
THIRTY years old, Unesco has paused to take stock,
to look at the world as it is today and to suggest
what it could be like tomorrow. This, in a nutshell, is
the substance of Unesco's Medium-Term Plan (1977-1982),
presented in this issue to readers of the Unesco Courier.
To prepare, for education, science, culture and commu¬
nication, a six-year programme of action corresponding to
what the international community united in Unesco can
and should expect of its joint undertaking implies both a
backward- and a forward-looking stance.
What the enterprise involves is a clear-eyed analysis
of the present situation, together with an exploration and
a signposting of those paths by which, through successive
stages of international action, each society and each dif¬
ferent group of human beings may, each in its own way,
carry the hopes of mankind towards the horizon of 1982.
It is this horizon which Unesco's Member States must
keep in view as they consult together, when they meet in
the Executive Board and at the General Conference which
is Unesco's sovereign body. This is the context in which
on a world-wide scale a series of guidelines have been
prepared, to serve national policy-making and regional and
international co-operation alike.
The Plan is the product of a collective effort. But it is
not an impersonal document. When, early in 1976, Unes¬
co's Director-General and his staff prepared the text which
was to be submitted to the Member States and examined
by the General Conference, they were able to draw on
contributions from several sessions of the General Confer¬
ence and of the Executive Board whereafter far-reaching
consultations with the Member States, both the content
and the methods of medium-term planning had been
discussed.
The Plan is indeed a collective one. But if its authors
are the Member States, as well as the Director-General
and his staff, they speak with a single voice. Each chapter,
whether it is general in scope or whether it examines a
specific problem, echoes the aspirations of mankind, the
true "centre of development". From beginning to end, the
Plan sounds a note of hope in the quest for "greater
chances to be human and to create". This message comes
from the depths of the human spirit; it reaches back to
time immemorial yet is constantly renewed.
The hope that the Medium-Term Plan would meet
with consensus proved to be justified, since the General
Conference was unanimous in approving its objectives and
guiding principles.
Consensus but not compromise. In the Plan a large
number of outlooks and approaches are reconciled in a sin¬
gle, all-embracing vision of unity in diversity. It proclaims
that the world is a whole whose parts are bound together
in solidarity, but that this solidarity is meaningless unless
rooted in respect for differences between individuals and
cultures and in respect for paths towards development
which have been freely chosen.
This' issue of the Unesco Courier presents only a se¬
lection of texts from the Medium-Term Plansome of
them given in full, others in abridged form. It should not
be forgotten that these extracts, chosen to illustrate the
main guidelines of the Plan, are part of the larger structure
of analyses and historical surveys which underlie the Plan's
specific proposals and point the way to action that will
enable us to meet the challenges of the future.

SIGNPOSTS
FOR 1982
Introduction to Unesco's
Medium-Term Plan
by Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow
Director-General of Unesco
The Unesco Courier presents on these pages key extracts from
the introduction to the Medium-Term Plan (1977-1982) adopted
by Unesco's General Conference during its recent session at
Nairobi (Kenya). This issue also contains a selection of salient
passages from the Plan itself, which constitutes a landmark in
the history of the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization.
IN a world that is constantly shrin¬
king, as far as both information
and action are concerned, a global
viewpoint becomes imperative. World
problems cannot be considered in
isolation; they are closely bound up
with each other.
At the same time, modern societies
display the greatest varietyeither
as a result of events beyond their
control, such as the growing diffe¬
rences in levels of development and
living standards, or through the deli¬
berate desire of individuals and
groups to assert their identity and
originality.
The crux of the problems facing
today's world lies perhaps in this
constant tension between a unity
which, rising above disparities, seeks
realization in a respect for differences,
and a diversity which, transcending
inequalities and conflicts, is rooted in
man's common vision of the future.
This becomes apparent as soon as
one broaches the fundamental issue
of human rights, which are now ac¬
knowledged to be indivisible and
universal in their application. Even
partial and localized violations of
those rights undermine and negate
their very principle.
Peace, too, is one and indivisible.
As a manifestation of tensions and
friction on a world-wide scale, each
individual conflict seriously threatens
world peace.
Peace itself can only be conceived
on the basis of justice: respect for
human rights and the right of self-
determination of peoples.
Peace is more than simply a matter
of refraining from war. If individuals
are deprived of their rights and liber¬
ties, if peoples are oppressed by
other peoples, if populations are
beset by poverty or suffering from
malnutrition and sickness, if there
is no determination to build a just
world, there can be no lasting peace.
The arms race, which is the most
obvious symptom of today's world¬
wide tensions, devours vast resources
which, directed to other ends, could
substantially improve the lot of the
least favoured peoples and give a
possibly decisive impetus to the
development of their societies.
The unity of the world is also seen
in the global crises which jeopardize
man's future: problems arising from
population growth, the risks of ex¬
hausting natural resources by despoi¬
ling the heritage of mankind and by
continual damage to an environment
which is the collective and irrepla¬
ceable setting for all human life.
The dangers threatening the world
in which we live are of concern to
each and every one of us.
Lastly, development, as the inter¬
national community must now con¬
ceive it, is a global, multidimensional
process taking account of economic,
political, social and cultural factors
in societies considered not in isola¬
tion but as parts of the complex net¬
work of relations and forces which

characterize the present state of
world affairs.
To be set against these ties, which
make a unified and global view of
world problems so necessary, are the
contradictions, the confrontations,
the tensions and the many deep-
rooted disparities which typify the
present situation. Threats of con¬
frontation persist.
Violations of human rights in asso¬
ciation with certain concepts of power
and various forms of racialism or
intolerance are examples of inhuman
behaviour at its most insane and
underscore the difficulties which
obstruct the progress of the ¡deal
of human unity and solidarity.
The inequalities in the modern
world have reached unprecedented
dimensions: economic growth, in
favouring particular societies, has
often taken place at the expensé of
other particularly numerous and
deprived groups. Such inequalities
may comprise overall disparities in
income between countries, due not
only to historical factors but also to
the different conditions in which
material goods are produced and to
the frequently inequitable terms of
international trade.
In the past, the inequalities bet¬
ween societies were relatively minor,
since all were at the pre-industrial
stage; the ratio between the average
income of the richest and the poorest
was approximately 3 to 1.
At the present time, however, the f
## [Page 8](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/074809engo.pdf#page=8) 0
### 46532: Signposts for 1982: introduction to UNESCO's Medium-term Plan
, ratio between average per capita
income in the most and least deve¬
loped countries often stands in the
region of 30 to 1, rising in extreme
cases to as much as 80 or 90 to 1.
There are also inequalities between
different social categories within
each nation.
These material inequalities apart,
equally serious discrepancies also
exist with regard to the possession of
and access to cultural goods and
amenities.
The very fact that there are still
some 800 million illiterates in the
world and that this number, far from
decreasing, has, because of popula¬
tion growth, slightly increased over
the past few years constitutes the
most glaring inequality as far as edu¬
cation is concerned. Inequality bet¬
ween the sexes in regard to education
also remains widespread.
Analysis of scientific development
shows that research potential, mea¬
sured either by the number of research
workers or by the level of research
expenditure, is concentrated in the
industrialized countries. The deve¬
loping countries, though they contain
the large majority of the world's popu¬
lation, possess only between 5 and
1 0 per cent of this potential.
To eliminate inequalities, and re¬
verse the present alarming trend
towards a widening of the gulf
between developed and developing
countries, due largely to the world
economic crisis and the acute wor¬
sening of the terms of trade, is a
matter of extreme urgency.
This is not to advocate integration
in a system in which all distinctions
would be obliterated. Alongside the
disparities which must be removed
there exist certain deliberate, posi¬
tively sought differences.
Individuals and groups, in a great
variety of circumstances, affirm their
desire to remain themselves, to avoid
standardization leading to loss of
their cultural characteristics, their
way of life and their own particular
conception of the well-being of the
individual and his relations with his
fellow men.
More, perhaps, than any other age,
ours is a period of profound and rapid
change. The transformations are
extremely varied, but in most cases
they appear to have one thing in
common: growth.
The modern age has been marked
anddespite certain doubts which
are beginning to emergecontinues
to be marked by virtually constant
growth. But growth directed towards
quantitative increase also results in
other disquieting and undesirable
forms of accumulation, such as the
wilful and constantly increasing pro¬
duction and stockpiling of nuclear
weapons and missiles capable of
carrying warheads of ever greater
destructive power.
Growth itself also has negative
consequences in the form of wastes,
pollution and the general effects of
those human activities which strike
at the overall balance of the planet.
All growth problems raise a number
of fundamental questions. First,
there is the question of inequality.
Far from diminishing it, growth really
seems to make for greater inequality.
Economic growth has undoubtedly
conferred major benefits, particularly
Because of

is not neutral.
The activity of
the scientist is
a social fact... 9
in today's industrialized countries,
where people can on the whole
satisfy their basic needs in terms
of food, housing, clothing and edu¬
cation. This is not so in the deve¬
loping countries, which are, one
might say by definition, unable to
provide their inhabitants with these
fundamental necessities of life.
But within developing countries
there are also often very great dispa¬
rities between those in -charge of
economic, administrative or political
affairs and the broad strata of the
population. Here, it has been noted
that even rapid economic growth
patterned on that of certain industria¬
lized countries has very little impact
on the people at large.
On the other hand, many developed
countries are showing symptoms of
malaise and deep-seated dissatisfac¬
tion due to the uneven distribution of
the benefits of growth. There are
still inequalities based on sex. Des¬
pite progress in this field and the fact
that earlier stigmas have to a greater
or lesser extent disappeared, women
often remain at a disadvantage, par
ticularly in matters of income. There
is also a great deal of inequality
between social categories.
Twilight areas of poverty still exist
in the most developed regions, in
city centres or in distant, neglected
and marginal provinces. The poverty
of the least favoured sections of the
population is of course much worse
in the developing countries, whether
among the rural masses or the often
unemployed inhabitants of the over-
populated fringes of the large towns.
Unemployment is particularly se¬
rious in developing countries where
growth, often limited to the modern
sector, has not succeeded in ensuring
full utilization of human resources.
But it has also assumed such propor¬
tions during the last few years in
certain developed countries that it
is now a major source of concern.
The equally fundamental issue of
the way of life engendered by eco¬
nomic growth is giving rise to in¬
creasing concern with regard to the
ultimate goals of development.
Consumption, which is an essen¬
tial element in sustaining economic
growth, is often diverted to the satis¬
faction of inessential needs. Pro¬
ducts and material objects arouse
needs where needs should determine
economic choices.
This is doubtless the source of
the alienation which many people
feel when confronted with the mecha¬
nisms of the consumer society.
In any case, it is insufficient to
consider the problem in quantitative
terms. The real problem is to know
where growth is leading, and to what
ends, and how man is to find self-
fulfilment through this process.
Only when growth is directed
towards goals which individuals and
groups set themselves, can it become
development in the full sense of the
term, that is, the full flowering of
all man's innate qualities, the expres¬
sion of his creativity in all its many
forms.
Science and technology have
brought great benefits to the human
race and have contributed to freeing
menor at least large numbers of
themfrom the constraints imposed
by nature.
But this power itself is fraught
with dangers, either because of the
damage inflicted by man on the
natural world, of which he is a part
and whose very survival is threatened
by the harm he does, or because of
the more effective means he has
acquired for dominating his fellow-
men. The destructiveness of modern
weapons and the opportunities for

tampering with the biological or
social existence of individuals are
extreme instances of these dangers.
Because of its effects, science is
not neutral. The activity of the
scientist is a social fact, and in this
respect it has political implications.
The universality of scientific know¬
ledge, which goes hand in hand with
its objectivity, should lead us to
consider the whole stock of such
knowledge as the common heritage
of mankind and to challenge any bid
for the exclusive appropriation of
scientific knowledge. If we adopt
this attitude, it is right that such
knowledge should be made available
to all without reservations of any
kind.
The problems of science and tech¬
nology are thus central to the search
for a fairer and more equitable world
order. While it is necessary for
all countries to develop their scien¬
tific and technological potential, this
task is particularly vital and urgent
for the developing countries.
Instead of importing technologies
designed for another environment,
it is better to try, whenever possible,
to devise appropriate technologies in
the developing countries themselves,
taking into account a set of specific
factors, including available resources,
forms of energy to be used, the coun¬
try's human potential.
In this connexion, it would be wise
to envisage the deliberate revival
of technical traditions based on age-
old skills which have long been
neglected in the name of modernity.
Because they tend to be regarded as
a way of reasserting the cultural
characteristics of a society, they can
be an excellent means of winning the
confidence of the whole population,
and not just of an élite, thus initiating
a general movement towards a form
of development benefiting widely from
the participation and initiative of.
every individual. f
"To eliminate inequalities, and reverse the
present alarming trend towards a widening
of the gulf between developed and developing
countries... is a prime necessity."
For this Latin-American woman (above left)
survival is the sole reward for exhausting
labour. Only the new economic order which
the world so urgently needs can improve her
existence and provide her with some of the
advantages (left) of an industrialized society.

As a result, there is a more acute
need to insert the development of
science more effectively within the
whole spectrum of society's ultimate
aims. It is absolutely essential to
reconcile the claims of the world of
learning and those of policy-makers.
The development of science and
technology cannot be left to chance
or to forces which would use them
for their own ends.
Neither economic growth nor the
development of science and techno¬
logy should be achieved at the cost
of sacrificing a people's cultural iden¬
tity. A future world civilization
would be devoid of meaning if it
were to be based on standardization
and banality and not on a wealth of
original cultural features.
Inasmuch as it is rooted in tradi¬
tion, culture has sometimes been
regarded as an obstacle to moderni¬
zation. But far from being a draw¬
back, the fact that countries refuse to
surrender their identity by accepting
alien models should, from both the
national and the global points of
view, be welcomed.
For what is rejected never amounts
to more than an imitation lacking the
authenticity that gives human enter¬
prises their- vigour and value. On
the other handand there are exam¬
ples to prove itthe Third World
countries can modernize themselves
without passively adopting processes
copied from foreign models.
A people's awareness of its cultural
identity can be a force that supports
economic development and moderni¬
zation and gives them a special dyna¬
mic quality.
The demand for recognition of
cultural identity, which is one of
the most characteristic features of
our time, is not a futile, nostalgic
attachment to the vanished past.
It is, of course, linked with tradition,
that record of experience accumulated
throughout the course of history by
a community. But its real signifi¬
cance lies in the use of the past as
a leaven for the future.
The notion of cultural identity,
which crystallized the aspirations of
the peoples of the Third World once
freed from colonial domination, is
still a decisive factor in their deter¬
mination to tackle the future in their
own way, untrammeled by the various
in some cases insidiousforms
of alienation sometimes impressed on
them by societies whose structures
and ways of life and development
imposed themselves as models at
some point during the past.
To assert one's cultural identity is
to resolve to be one's self, but this
does not imply withdrawal and isola¬
tion. On the contrary, it is by remain¬
ing true to themselves that cultures
can evolve harmoniously, grow stron¬
ger and maintain a fruitful give-and-
take relationship with other cultures.
Thus, the preservation of the cul¬
tural heritage, in its more diverse
aspectswhether by safeguarding
monuments and towns from the ra¬
vages of time, pollution or the effects
of human action, or by ensuring the
vitality of languages, oral traditions
and performing arts and musicis at
one and the same time, and indivi-
sibly, an endeavour to strengthen
cultural identity. It is the essential
condition " for making one culture
available and receptive to all others,
é The demand for
recognition of
cultural identity
is one of
the most
characteristic
features
of our time. '
and a source of enrichment for all
mankind.
Accordingly, it is through mutual
knowledge of, and respect for, the
different cultures of the world that
they may all be brought together in
a genuine cultural whole that is free
from domination by the limited values
of its individual components, yet
which eschews the mere pooling of
commonplaces that smacks of cul¬
tural cosmopolitanism.
Nothing is harder to define, how¬
ever, than what a given culture really
is. The same difficulties arise in
defining culture as a whole. Narrow,
elitist definitions of culture, viewed
as a system of fine arts and literature,
and as a luxury reserved for the pri¬
vileged few, must be superseded.
Culture, in the full sense of the
term, is essential to the vitality of
any society; it is the sum total of a
people's creative activities, of its
ways of producing and acquiring
things, its forms of organization, its
beliefs and sufferings, its work and
its leisure, its dreams and its suc¬
cesses.
This being so, policies confined to
culture alone are not enough; policies
in other spheres of human activity,
particularly in education and commu¬
nication, must be devised.
Together with the quest for cultur¬
al identity goes the clearly affirmed
determination of each society to plan
and carry out educational action
geared to its own particular objectives,
rejecting anything that may imply
the imposition of knowledge, attitudes
and patterns of behaviour which are
inconsistent with its real aspirations
and needs.
Very often, the educational systems
of the developing countries are mere
copies of systems devised in indus¬
trialized countries for the benefit of
other societies, employing other
means and serving other values. It
is an essential task of educational
policy-makers to redefine and remod¬
el their educational systems in the
light of their countries' own aims
and their actual social, economic and
cultural conditions.
As far as communication is concer¬
ned, it is equally necessary to steer
clear of the threat to cultural identity
which may lie in the fact that all
countries are not equally well equip¬
ped with communication media.
At the present time, the dissemi¬
nation of information is largely a
one-way process, issuing from a few
centres, mainly in the industrialized
countries. Such information must
reflect the concerns, aspirations and
even the point of view of the societies
from which it stems and on whose
media it depends; their mass commu¬
nication organizations tend, wittingly
or unwittingly, to impose cultural
models.
It is vitally important to establish
the necessary conditions for a truly
balanced exchange of information,
which is the only base for any attempt
to create genuine international soli¬
darity.

people can on the whole satisfy their basic needs in
terms of housing, clothing and education; but this is not
so in the developing countries, which cannot provide
their inhabitants with these fundamental requirements of
life." (Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow)

### 46532: Signposts for 1982: introduction to UNESCO's Medium-term Plan
é A truly balanced
exchange of
information is
the only base
for any attempt
to create genuine
international
solidarity.
> aspects of the problems facing the
modern world lead to a more general
themethe development of peoples
and societies.
Although the problems of deve¬
lopment are foremost among the
concerns of the less advanced coun¬
tries, they also concern the so-called
developed countries. It has rightly
been said that the world contains
only developing countries.
Many industrialized countries are
going through economic and mone¬
tary crises, experiencing serious
shortages in a given sector of pro¬
duction, and are facing environmental
problems or difficulties affecting this
or that part of the community.
Under the pressures for uniformity
imposed by the industrial machine
and aggravated by mass media whose
domination is ill-checked; faced with
changes in economic and social struc¬
tures which sever the individual from
his roots; confronted with crises
affecting youth, urban life and popular
culture, many developed countries
are being obliged to seek new types
of development.
Growth has no meaning unless it
contributes to the fulfilment of indi¬
viduals and of the community, unless
it offers greater chances to be human
and to create.
Such a view of development is
obviously far removed from one that
takes into account only its economic
aspect, that is to say growth meas¬
ured in quantitative terms, for ex¬
ample, the level of the Gross National
Product.
Development of this kind, based
solely on market forces, can only
lead to greater disparities and more
dissatisfaction of all kinds.
Development in its universality and
diversity is a process which is found
everywhere, but its centre is nowhere.
The conviction that this is sobased
on a careful analysis of the problems
of the world situationnaturally leads
us to question the validity of an
international system which, explicitly
or implicitly, assumes that certain
centres of economic power are pre¬
eminent and that international rela¬
tions have a rationale of their own.
Recent crises, such as those in the
monetary and energy fields, have
indeed revealed the limitations of
this system.
In point of fact, there is a deep-
seated contradiction between the
logic underlying the present inter¬
national system, centred as it is on
the industrialized countries, and the
demand for an overall solution of
problems, based on solidarity and
justice.
The clearest proof of this contra¬
diction lies in the demand of the
developing countries for a new kind
of economic relations with the
industrialized countries, ensuring that
each country could control its own
natural resources and use them for
the benefit of its people, participating
on an equal footing in decisions con¬
cerning the operation of the interna¬
tional economic system.
In short, the developing countries
are calling for the adoption of new
and more equitable rules in inter¬
national economic relations.
These aspirations have focused on
the idea of a new international eco¬
nomic order, whose formulation by
the international community has led
to the adoption by the United Nations
General Assembly of the Declaration
and Programme of Action on the
establishment of a new international
economic order (1 May 1 974) and the
Charter of Economic Rights and Duties
of States (12 December 1 974).
In reality, if we take a global view
of these problems, one which is
consistent with Unesco's specific mis¬
sion to reflect upon the various pro¬
blems of our day in their relation
to science, culture, education and
information, we shall see the move¬
ment towards a new international
economic order in its broadest sense,
as a movement towards a world
order embracing its economic, social
and cultural dimensions and satisfying
the basic human aspirations towards
progress, peace and justice.

### 46533: Birthright of man
BIRTHRIGHT
OF MAN
ORE forcefully, perhaps, than
ever before, the internatio¬
nal community is voicing its
determination that human rights, in
the very broadest sense of the term,
shall be respected everywhere. And
yet, on this fundamental issue, huma¬
nity is in something of a dilemma.
For it is manifestly absurd to ac¬
cord freedoms to those who are too
poor to enjoy them. On the other
hand, the cause of human dignity
has nothing to gain from improve¬
ments in the material well-being of
vast numbers of people, if they are
kept in the bondage of ignorance,
cut off from their fellows and excluded
from the mainstream of history.
Human rights are violated daily:
Deliberately: State authorities, claim¬
ing to be a law unto themselves,
justify such violations on the grounds
of "exceptional circumstances" (poli¬
tical or social crises) and the need to
preserve public order or safeguard
national unity.
Flagrantly: The flouting of human
rights in specific, localized situations
(apartheid, remnants or revivals of
colonialist or neo-colonialist oppres¬
sion, foreign occupation...) often
takes place under cover of a travesty
of the principles which are denied.
More subtly: Through the structures
and behaviour of unjust societies
which, while paying lip-service to
democracy, oppress and exploit cer¬
tain underprivileged groups or cate¬
gories of individuals.
Through torture, and through inter¬
ference with freedom of thought,
conscience or religion or with oppor-
14
tunities to seek, receive or circulate
information or ideas.
Violations of which the community
has recently become more aware,
such as the unwarranted seizure of
natural or cultural resources or the
despoiling of the environment.
Violations which arise from con¬
tempt for or rejection of cultural iden¬
tity, or from the tensions present in
multi-ethnic societies.
The achievement of universal hu¬
man rights also implies that everyone
should live in conditions free from
exposure to hunger, poverty, appre¬
hension for the future, or the extremes
of ignorance and social ostracism;
that no one shall be condemned to
distress and despair.
Respect for human dignity is a uni¬
versal principle which admits of no
exceptions.
No international organization is in a
better position than Unesco to appre¬
ciate the fundamental importance of
promoting human rights, to publicize
them and to transform them into
realities.
The scandal of inequality cannot be
justified by the claim that times are
hard. On the contrary,, the require¬
ments of public order and security
not to mention the lust for powerare
neither a vindication nor an excuse for
arbitrary imprisonment and the use of
torture. Concern for growthnot to
mention the lure of gaincannot
make the subjection and exploitation
of human labour acceptable; nor can
the desire to build up an intellectual
élite warrant keeping the mass of the
people in ignorance.
Unesco has set itself five main
tasks in the field of human rights:
1 The first involves increasing our
knowledge about human rights
and denouncing violations of them.
The aim is to protect man as he is,
through the rights inscribed in texts
which already exist. Without aban¬
doning the quest for solutions to the
eternal conflict between the individual
and the State, it is also necessary to
promote knowledge and recognition
of human rights as a field for co¬
operation between the individual and
the State, when confronted with
abuses of private power (in the case
of multinational corporations, for
example) within the framework of a
new economic order.
O The second task concerns res¬
pect for cultural identity. The
right to one's own culture is invoked
throughout the world in the strug¬
gle against racial, ethnic, linguistic
or cultural discrimination, as a
basic human right.
Without losing its political, liberat¬
ing function, the notion of cultural
identity is now beginning to have
economic and social implications,
in the current search for a new inter¬
national economic order. It is
becoming increasingly obvious that
the introduction of such an order
implies that each nation should have
an ever clearer sense of its identity
and vocation.
By asserting their own cultural
identity, all peoples, whether or not

### 46533: Birthright of man
One of the tasks that
Unesco has set itself as a
matter of priority, is the
safeguarding and protection
of human rights, which are
violated dailyeither
flagrantly (racialism,
neocolonialism, abuse of
State power, etc.) or more
insidiously (exploitation of
labour, scandalous
inequalities, linguistic or
cultural discrimination, etc.).
Left, the child's garden of
happiness, all too frequently
replaced by the indignity of
bondage (right), as in this
detail from a mural by the
Mexican artist David Alfaro
Siqueiros (1896-1974).
they are their own masters politically,
whether or not they are great powers,
whether they have a full range of
resources and skills at their disposal
or are still developing, can lay the
foundations for cultural pluralism.
Acceptance of and respect for such
pluralism, based on equal rights and
mutual esteem, has now emerged as
a factor for peace and understanding
between nations.
Cultural regions rarely coincide
with political boundaries. This being
so, comparisons, exchanges and
friendly relations should be possible
between countries which share a
common heritage, even if their
economic or social circumstances or
ideological standpoints are today at
variance.
Q The third task concerns a part of
humanity that has for too long
been subject to discrimination, or
even exploitation: women, who re¬
present almost half of the world popu¬
lation, almost 70 per cent of them
living in developing countries.
Despite all the progress and efforts
made, the three causes of women's
inferior position in the world, namely,
the burden of family responsibilities,
inequality in education and discrimi¬
nation in employment, have by no
means disappeared.
As far as Unesco is concerned, two
major principles of action may be laid
down. The first is that any genuine
change in the status of women in¬
volves bringing to light all the forms
of discrimination to which they are
subjected in education, science,
culture and communication.
The second principle is that women
must themselves take steps to im¬
prove their situation. This implies
that they should participate in work¬
ing out reforms designed to grant
them a fair deal.
Women's full contribution to the
progress of society also presupposes
their ability to gain a hearing in
decision-making bodies, from village
councils or co-operative associations
right up to the highest national level.
There is a wide gap between official
recognition of women's fundamental
political rights and active participation
by women in political life: when wo¬
men are represented, such represen¬
tation rarely reflects their numbers or
their abilities.
A The fourth task is to defend the
rights of refugees and members
of national liberation movements.
Ever since it was set up, Unesco
has helped refugees. In the years
following the end of the Second
World War, for instance, it supported
the United Nations Relief and Works
Agency (UNRWA), assuming techni¬
cal responsibility for the education of
the children of 1.5 million Palestine
refugees. 1971 saw the launching
of a special programme of aid to
African liberation movements recogni¬
zed by the Organization of African
Unity.
C The fifth and final task concerns
the mobilization of education and
the media in publicizing the vital need
for universal observance of human
rights. The contents and interrela¬
tions of those rights should be ex¬
plained and people should be encou¬
raged and enabled to seek a fuller
understanding of the preconditions for
human rights, and to strive for their
implementation.
The promotion of education and
information concerning human rights
poses a great many problems. The
development of teaching about hu¬
man rights encounters difficulties
identical with those met during any
process of educational change or
reform. Teachers must be prepared
for new tasks.
Education and information have a
crucial role to play as societies ad¬
vance towards their chosen goals.
The assurance of human rights will
depend to a considerable extent on
educating and informing people so
that they are aware of their rights
and know how to exercise them in an
effective and responsible manner.

### 46535: In search of a lasting peace
SEARCH OF
A LASTING PEACE
AT its 1 8th session in 1 974, the
Unesco General Conference
strongly emphasized that:
"Peace cannot consist solely in the
absence of armed conflict but implies
principally a process of progress, jus¬
tice and mutual respect among
peoples designed to secure the build¬
ing of an international society in
which everyone can find his true place
and enjoy his share of the world's
intellectual and material resources..."
What is at stake today, as far as the
issue of war and peace is concerned,
is the survival of the entire human
species, or at any rate of mankind as
the vehicle of civilization.
The relative calm that has settled
on relations between the industrial
nationsdue, at least in part, to the
balance of atomic terrorshould lull
no one into an undue optimism about
the future. Above all, it should not
delude us as to what is happening
here and now. War continues to
wreak havoc, the only difference
being that the theatre of war has
moved to the poor countries, where
the effects of the major international
antagonisms continue to make them¬
selves felt in various ways.
Without the guarantee of peace
and the reduction of tensions, the
solution to all the problems facing
mankind would be seriously jeopar¬
dized. Similarly, no international
settlement secured at the cost of the
freedom and dignity of peoples and
respect for individuals can claim to
be a truly peaceful one.
In view of the destitution and stag¬
nation which is the lot of a consid¬
erable proportion of mankind, and the
need to marshall all available resour¬
ces in order to satisfy the vital needs
of a rapidly expanding world popula¬
tion, the frantic arms race, which in
What the world
spends on arms
in one day would
finance all Unesco's
work for seven years.
itself constitutes a serious threat to
world peace, increasingly stands
condemned in the eyes of the world
as a scandalous squandering of ener¬
gies and resources.
True peace, in the sense intended
by Unesco"just, lasting and cons¬
tructive"should be seen not merely
as the absence of war but as an equi¬
table and democratic system of inter¬
national relations, entailing the es¬
tablishment and maintenance of an
order of friendly understanding and
co-operation based upon a commu¬
nity of interests among peoples,
rooted in respect for and the promo¬
tion of human rights.
Unesco is not competent to settle
specifically political disputes between
States. However, it has a mission
to work directly and explicitly for the
strengthening of peace. As its foun¬
ders stressed, Unesco is concerned
primarily with the minds of men, and
"it is in the minds of men that the
defences of peace must be cons¬
tructed".
Unesco must undertake the work of
educating young people and adults,
making an appeal to freedom, the
exercise of judgement and generosity,
so that the reign of fellowship may
prevail and the public at large may
acquire an informed understanding
of the conditions in which a just peace
founded on mutual respect may be
achieved.
For the price of a bomber...
nmWm HERE is an absolute prerequisite for any juster new order:
I peace and the removal of such obstacles as the arms race
B which undermine the very principles inseparable from the
establishment of such an order.
"Unesco is concerned with the arms race, and particularly with the
prospects for. at least gradual disarmament, from two points of view.
"In the first place, if only a part of the immense financial, human
and intellectual resources which are today being swallowed up
without any constructive result were allocated to more fitting ends,
this would be sufficient to remedy the most glaring forms of human
wretchedness and to make a decisive contribution to concerted and
resolute action by the international community for the benefit of
mankind.
"Secondly, it is important to dispel the artificial atmosphere of
distrust and mutual fear which is sustained by the arms race and to
remove the threats which the perpetuation of this situation leaves
hanging over world peace.
"Decisions in this matter depend in the last resort on governments
themselves. It is to them that I now turn, earnestly appealing to
them not merely to redouble their efforts to achieve agreed disarma¬
ment, but also to set aside part of the resources now being used for
the accumulation of weapons of destruction, for programmes which
serve the cause of mankind in Unesco's fields of competence.
"I will go even further and say that to make available to Unesco
itself the amount of money represented, for example, by the cost of a
modern bomber or any other expensive piece of military equipment,
would be on the part of the Member States taking such a step, both
a symbolic gesture of great importance and a direct contribution to
the cause of international co-operation in education, science, culture
and communication."

### 46537: Science, technology, man and society
SCIENCE.
TECHNOLOGY,
MAN
AND SOCIETY
NO one today can doubt that
science has acquired a politi¬
cal dimension. It stems from
the power that knowledge confers
upon the individuals, groups and
countries which possess it.
It is a characteristic feature of
today's world that some nations have
an infinitely greater share than others
in the activities which contribute to
the advance of knowledge. Modern
science is the product of the work of
a relatively small number of teams of
scientists in a limited number of
countries.
The vast majority of research pro¬
jects (95 per cent) are still confined
to the 25 most developed countries.
In the most powerful of these coun¬
tries, the greatest resources for scien¬
tific research have been allocated, in
the first place, to military projects or
to large-scale programmes which
combine the quest for prestige with
the pursuit of industrial power (nu¬
clear energy, space programmes) and,
in the second place, to economic ob¬
jectives (computer science, electro¬
nics, aeronautics).
Lagging behind in science and
technology, the developing
world is increasingly dependent
on the industrialized countries.
The transfer of technology has
proved both inadequate and
ill-adapted to local needs.
Unesco will spare no effort to
solve this major problem
through the promotion of
scientific education in
developing countries, through
help in preparing science
policies and through research
into the relations between
science and society. Opposite

### 46537: Science, technology, man and society
These countries generally possess
between 100 and 300 scientists and
engineers for every 1 0,000 of their
inhabitants, together with a develo¬
ped industrial sector, a diversified
economy and a high rate of urban
development.
At the other end of the scale, where
the size of resources devoted to
science and scientific development is
concerned, are some 30 or so of the
world's least developed countries.
In these countries, whose economies
are more often than not predominant¬
ly agricultural, there are rarely more
than a few hundred scientists and
engineers for every million inhabi¬
tants.
Illiteracy is still rife and there is
relatively little demand for science.
For these countries the road to deve¬
lopment necessarily lies through the
application of the discoveries of
scientists in other countries.
The developing countries are at a
similar disadvantage where the edu¬
cation and training of scientists and
engineers are concerned. The ave¬
rage number of science degrees per
100,000 population in 1970 was
37 for North America and 13 for Eu¬
rope, but only 3 for the Arab States,
2 for Asia (including Japan), 1.4 for
Latin America and 0.2 for Africa.
THE industrialized countries asa
whole are estimated to pos¬
sess 90 per cent of the world's
scientists and engineers (i.e. ten
times as many as the developing
countries). It might take as long
as a century to redress this imbalance.
In consequence, the existing body of
scientific knowledge is in some
measure irrelevant to the problems
facing the modern world.
This being so, the application of
science and technology for the
benefit of man and society calls for
action on two fronts:
existing knowledge must be applied
to the solution of present-day pro¬
blems in agriculture, industry, com¬
munications and the other sectors of
economic life; the major difficulty
encountered here concerns the "trans¬
fer" of knowledge;
the necessary capacities must be
developed to enable the developing
countries eventually to take part in
the world-wide progress of science
and to cope with their own problems
as equal partners of the most advan¬
ced countries.
The fact that the developing coun¬
tries lag behind in scientific and tech¬
nological development has contribu¬
ted to their increasing dependence on
the industrialized countries.
This issue immediately leads to
another: how can existing technology
be transferred and how may alterna¬
tive technologies be developed out¬
side the mainstream of current tech
nological trends in industrialized
countries?
There are limits to the transfer of
technology. In the developing coun¬
tries, economic and social conditions
will often call for the creation of
technologies whose characteristics
(labour-intensiveness, energy require¬
ments, use of raw materials) differ
radically from those of existing tech¬
nologies. In practical terms, this
amounts to the development of alter¬
native technologies rather than adap¬
tation.
ATTEMPTS through aid pro¬
grammes and through sales
by multinational corporations
to provide developing countries with
similar or identical technologies so
that they can follow in the footsteps
of the industrialized countries have,
to say the least, not been entirely
successful. The widening techno¬
logy gap and the dependency resulting
from such attempts have led to greater
disappointment on the part of all
concerned.
This is not to say that the increas¬
ing availability of vaccines and phar¬
maceutical products, miracle seeds
and efficient synthetic fertilizers, and
the increased capacities for the disco¬
very and exploitation of natural
resources, have had no impact on
the developing countries; but at the
same time they have been penalized
by continuing injustices in the inter¬
national economic system, coupled
with their inability to choose and
master their own technologies.
It would be advisable, in the first
place, to select priority areas of
scientific activity or research which
would have a positive impact on the
global effort to improve the transfer
and adaptation of technology. Spe¬
cial emphasis should be placed on
the development of analytical tools
necessary for the planning and eva¬
luating of transferred or alternative
technologies.
Unesco's action will be primarily
concerned with the following mat¬
ters:
the evaluation of trends in science
and technology as they affect society;
the identification of the cultural and
moral problems posed by progress in
existing scientific disciplines;
the study of those human aspects
of science and technology which are
of particular concern to the develop¬
ing countries.
Education, and higher scientific
and technological education in parti¬
cular, is a first priority. It is essen¬
tial to concentrate the slender
resources available on a small number
of carefully selected key problems in
fields which are most vital to medium-
term developmentland and water
management, agriculture, cheap
forms of energyand rigorous selec
tion is the basis of scientific policy¬
making in the developing countries.
Such reasoning has led Unesco to
concentrate on the promotion of
endogenous scientific development
which, in most of the developing
countries, remains a more distant
prospect.
To this end, a general four-point
strategy has been adopted:
to promote science education for
everyone;
to assist in the training of speciali¬
zed staff and in the establishment
and operation of institutions concer¬
ned with higher education, research
and the provision of scientific and
technological services;
to encourage the formulation of
scientific and technological develop¬
ment policies;
to foster a better understanding of
the impact of scientific and technolo¬
gical progress on society.
WHAT is required in many
countries is a thorough¬
going reform of teaching
programmes and methods. This
should usually be accompanied by
an increase in the time devoted to
science and technology in primary
and secondary schools, so that pupils
are provided with a sound basis for
further studies in a particular branch
of science or technology.
In the developing countries, science
and technology students will, in the
course of their careers, have to as¬
sume direct or indirect responsibilities
in the scientific and technological
development of their countries. It
will thus be equally important to equip
them to understand how science and
society are interrelated.
A major obstacle to the extension
of technological education in many
developing countries has been the
resistance of pupils and parents to
manual and technical training, which
is considered as inferior to more aca¬
demic studies.
Moreover, in many countries, tech¬
nological education for girls has fallen
short of that offered to boys. Some
Member States are now overcoming
this resistance, partly through care¬
fully prepared campaigns by the mass
media in favour of legislation to make
technological education compulsory.

### NON-ARTICLE-TEXT
Development should be
the servant of mankind
and not its master. The
ultimate purpose of
economic growth must be
spiritual and moral
fulfilment, and not merely
material well-being.
Unesco's mission is to
view development in
human terms, and to
encourage men, women
and children alike to
express their cultural
identity. Right,
motherhood in Nepal.

### 46539: Man; the centre of development
MAN-THE CENTRE
OF DEVELOPMENT
IT is still unreservedly acknowl¬
edged that development can nei¬
ther begin nor continue without
economic growth.
Today, however, no one can deny
that this is not the whole story, that
economic growth is justified by the
social progress which it engenders
and that it is more than just a stage
on the way to such progress.
Economic development cannot be
dissociated from the development of
society as a whole. It depends on
the active participation of everyone,
and this can only be obtained through
smoothly running institutions and the
whole-hearted support of individuals
and groups.
The principles of humanism deter¬
mine the goals to which development
must be directed. Man must benefit
from it. Development must not
merely contain the promise of greater
social justice: it must, from beginning
to end, translate the principle of
equity into realities.
Furthermore, development must be
of benefit to man from every point of
view. The raising of living standards
is, of course, fundamental, but an
improvement in material conditions is
not enough, by itself, to allow people
to lead a life worth living.
Development must therefore be
aimed at the spiritual, moral and
material fulfilment of man in his
entirety, both as a member of society
and as an individual. It should lead
to, but it should also derive from,
greater and more informed particip¬
ation by the individual in the life of
the community.

### 46539: Man; the centre of development
The humanist principle also deter¬
mines the paths of development. If
man must clearly be the objective and
the beneficiary of development, he is
in the first place its agent.
If the humanist significance of deve¬
lopment is to be fully appreciated,
it is equally important to take account
of its international context which,
to a large extent, determines its
conditions.
The importance of the international
community's decision to work to¬
gether for the establishment of a
new economic order on a world
scale cannot be over-emphasized.
Apart from an indispensable in¬
crease in the resources available to
the developing nations, what this new
international economic order pro¬
mises and demands is that each
country should be able to make its
own decisions and control its own
destiny. This is independence in the
profound sense of the term. This is
dignity for the community and for its
members.
Consequently, each country will be
enabled and impelled to reorganize
and liberate its economic and social
life, and to assemble its resources
more coherently in an autonomous
development effort inspired by freely
accepted motives and aspirations.
In the task of explaining, illustra¬
ting and achieving this new order,
Unesco has an extremely important,
unique and in many respects central
role to play.
Unesco, as an organization respon¬
sible for the growth and enrichment
of all the sciences and as the only
body which provides opportunities for
participation in large-scale programmes
of intellectual co-operation, thereby
providing access to the world's store¬
house of scientific knowledge and
information, should logically serve as
the focal point and catalyst in the
creation of social science infrastruc¬
tures and in promoting the develop¬
ment of a social science with national
and international, disciplinary and in¬
terdisciplinary components.
In other words, it is Unesco's task,
on behalf of the United Nations sys¬
tem as a whole, to co-ordinate all
efforts in this field.
Unesco, with its general responsi¬
bility for the promotion of spiritual
values, is also empowered to act as
a centre for humanistic and ethical
reflection and to go beyond merely
technical considerations, viewing the
problems of development in terms of
their human significance.
Cultural action cannot be confined
to the mere diffusion of culture, and
access to culture means more than
merely making cultural works avai¬
lable. For even if the individual has
the means and opportunities to parti¬
cipate in cultural life, he must also
make an effort intellectual, ideologi¬
cal or psychologicalwhich in many
cases requires him to perform a lib¬
erating act: the assertion of his per¬
sonality in the search for cultural
identity.
The participation of large numbers
of people in cultural life reflects first
and foremost a sense of belonging to
a culture and to the society from
which it emanates.
Even when a culture is related to
others, it has certain unique features
which reflect its specific identity.
This is true of all countries, and is
more obvious still in cases where
cultural identity is asserting itself with .
particular force as the expression of
the dignity of peoples that until
recently were subject to foreign poli¬
tical and cultural domination. In this
way access becomes participation.
Where individuals are concerned,
access to and participation in cultural
life encourage creation and innova¬
tion, the exploration and free expres¬
sion of the self, thereby leading to
new and as yet unsuspected forms of
art.
If the public at large is to partici¬
pate effectively in cultural life, it is
vitally important that policies to
promote cultural activities should be
integrated with action in other fields
designed to achieve the same object.
These policies concern three sec¬
tors in which action by the authori¬
ties may provoke action in depth, the
effects of which will be felt particu¬
larly in the medium and long term:
education, communication and book
promotion.
Decisions taken by Member States
reveal their growing awareness of
the overall nature of development
and of the fact that culture is one
of its inherent factors.
The true cause of the disequilibrium
with which the world is confronted at
the present time is seen as much as
a crisis of values as an economic
crisis. There is a realization that
man aspires to new values more than
to comfort and enjoyment.
This quest for new values is a cul¬
tural process whereby man displays
his essential dignity and his equality
with his fellows, by communicating,
creating, fashioning himself, by giving
to life a meaning and a richness which
stem as much, if not more, from the
state of "being" as from the state of
"having".

### 46540: The Educational imperative
THE
EDUCATIONAL
IMPERATIVE
A
NY fundamental reform of edu¬
cation is first and foremost a
structural reform.
The idea of universal education
was slow in taking shape. For a
long time access to education was
restricted to the few.
Now, as a result of increasingly
rapid changes during the last few
decades, it is clear that education is
both a factor of development and
progress and a fundamental human
right.
But broader access to education
is not enough if education is to be
truly democratic. Equality of oppor¬
tunities must also be achieved, and
this means that education must be
adapted to the needs and characteris¬
tics of different groups.
Whilst education is taking an in¬
creasing number of forms, the need
for an educational experience com-

### 46540: The Educational imperative
By 1985, Asia, Africa and Latin America will need 12 million teachers (3 million more
than in 1977). It has always been and remains one of Unesco's major concerns to promote
education as a ladder to progress, especially in the developing countries. The teaching
provided for tomorrow's men and women must have international dimensions. Below,

has 3,000 pupils of all ages.
mon to all, and in any case for an
education of equal quality for all,
is essential to democracy.
Educational policies, once limited
to a few broad guidelines, now tend
to set their objectives firmly within
the framework of the social, econo¬
mic and cultural environment.
Unesco has played a major role
in this process. After an earlier pe¬
riod of scattered activities, it set out
to define the goals of educational
policy and planning more clearly, edu¬
cation being considered as an integral
part of social and economic deve¬
lopment. A special effort has
been made to emphasize the need
for formulating national educational
policies based on the principles of
self-reliance.
Priority for Unesco assistance will
be given to the least developed
countries and to those countries
which are preparing or carrying out
fundamental educational reforms,
aiming in particular at improving edu¬
cation for the socially and economi¬
cally underprivileged.
Concern for renewal of the content
and methods of education lies at the
heart of the universal desire to en¬
sure that education meets the re¬
quirements of our time.
But the preparation and applica¬
tion of content and methods are
hampered by certain specific diffi¬
culties. The most obvious of these
results from the transformation of
human knowledge caused by the
progress of science and technology.
Secondly, the tasks assigned to
education by a world undergoing
technical, social (and doubtless mo¬
ral) change are linked to the emer¬
gence of new goals, and in particular
to the search for a new world order,
embracing the economic, social and
cultural aspects of life.
Thirdly, those directly involved in
education expect its content and
methods to be less theoretical and
better adapted to the social environ¬
ment, and more deeply rooted in na¬
tional languages or mother tongues.
More important still, they expect
education to be more closely related
to life and capable of helping chil¬
dren, young people and adults not
only to understand the world in
which they live or will live, but also
to transform it.
The content of school textbooks
must no longer reflect cultural and
ethnic values (or indeed cultural and
social conditions) other than those
of the country in which the pupil is
living, so as to facilitate learning
and the integration of individuals
with their family and with their so- k
cial environment. t

### 46540: The Educational imperative
Universal access to education is not
enough. Teaching programmes must be
adapted to local cultural traditions and
local social and economic conditions, and
should be deeply rooted in the national
language or the pupils' mother tongue.
Too many schools throughout the world
still have to contend with a crippling lack
of facilities lack of books, equipment
and teaching materials. Teacher and
pupils at this village school in Tanzania
(right) seem to be coping with such
difficulties, judging from their expressions
of rapt concentration. Far right, tiny oil
lamps brighten the autumn darkness in
India during Dewali, the festival of light.
> Generally speaking, Unesco will
endeavour to stimulate and guide
the activities undertaken in Member
States by identifying gaps to be filled
by international action, with particular
reference to the specific needs of
the developing countries.
In the vast majority of countries
there is still a considerable demand
for teachers, despite the efforts of the
last decade.
To provide universal primary educa¬
tion in 1985, the three regions of
Asia, Africa and Latin America would
require more than 12 million teachers
or 3 million more than in 1977.
Taking potential world require¬
ments as a whole, it is estimated
that more than 4 million primary
school teachers must be trained
between 1977 and 1982, the majo¬
rity for the least developed countries.
The problem is equally serious in
secondary education since, during the
same period, the annual average
rates of increase for teaching staff
should reach 3.9 per cent in Asia,
6.1 per cent in Latin America and
6.4 percent in Africa.
During the next few years, there¬
fore, the recruitment crisis, still acute
in many developing countries, may be
expected to persist or even to worsen
in those countries where population
growth and the rapid expansion of
enrolments in primary schools will
entail an increased demand for tea¬
chers at all levels.
In the majority of countries, insti¬
tutions of higher education have
been responsible for a cleavage both
between urban and rural populations
and between intellectual and manual
workers. Despite continuing attempts
to view society as a whole, these
divisions still persist even in the
most industrialized countries, and to
a much greater extent in countries
which imported models from the
former colonial powers. 61.2 per
cent of the total world population
lives in rural areas, and in several
developing countries this figure
exceeds 75 per cent.
The way to integrated rural deve¬
lopment will be much easier if higher
education is made accessible to rural
populations.
Higher education can no longer be
geared exclusively to the needs of a
specific age group. It must widen
its scope to include the community
as a whole. Democratization is thus
essential if the contribution of higher
education to social progress and
human development is to be streng¬
thened; it is also one of higher edu¬
cation's chief goals.
In this respect, the establishment in
1972 of the United Nations Univer¬
sity in Tokyo (Japan) constitutes an
important landmark. Its task is to
study the urgent problems concerning
the survival, development and welfare
of mankind from an interdisciplinary
standpoint.
Another feature of the current
transformations is the emergence of
educational systems which employ
the services of various kinds of spe¬
cialist teachers, such as part-time
teachers with practical experience in
production or management. This is
one of the trends in education's
growing responsiveness to society.
Secondly, the use of media such
24

### 46540: The Educational imperative
as radio, television and other audio¬
visual systems makes it necessary
to call on technicians and even engi¬
neers who thus contribute their
skills to the work of education.
The training received by teachers
is reflected in the education they
provide, the effects of which extend
into the working life of their pupils.
The adults of the early 21st century
will have passed through the hands of
teachers trained in the next few years.
Unesco's work in this field has
three guiding principles:
to ensure that the training of edu¬
cational personnel plays a significant
role in educational innovation;
to promote the formulation of inte¬
grated policies and plans for the
continuous training of teachers of all
kinds;
to compare practical experience
acquired in teacher training in the
light of educational reforms in diffe¬
rent countries.
The growing demand for education
is coupled with the increasing length
of the educational process. There
can, however, be no question of
prolonging school or university edu¬
cation indefinitely. The concept of
life-long education implies that
adults at different times in their lives
and within the framework of their
various experiences, should make use
of all the opportunities offered to
them.
Unesco's activities in this respect
are threefold:
endeavouring to help Member
States to develop certain elements of
their educational systems, such as
literacy, adult education, etc.;
making a considerable contribution
to the elaboration of the concept of
life-long education;
thirdly, in recent years, Unesco
has begun to study certain specific
problems related to the reorganization
of educational systems.
There is at present a broad agree¬
ment of principle in the different
countries concerning the need to
promote and intensify adult education
using procedures suited to the diver
sity of situations. Adult education is
an integral part of educational sys¬
tems designed with life-long educa¬
tion in mind. By educating parents
and parents-to-be, it creates a fav¬
ourable environment for, and is
complementary to, the education of
their children.
Adult education, which is in
essence multidisciplinary, may be
regarded as a set of activities corres¬
ponding to' various objectives, of
which the most important are:
the intensification of the struggle
against illiteracy;
the improvement of professional
efficiency;
the understanding of the major
problems faced by the national and
international community;
the acquisition of practical know¬
ledge in areas such as health, nutri¬
tion, upbringing of children, and
consumer affairs.

### 46541: An Equal chance for everyone
AN EQUAL CHANCE
FOR EVERYONE
SOME groups of people, such as
the illiterate, rural communities,
women and girls, the young
and the elderly, have fewer opportu¬
nities than others for expressing them¬
selves fully, as individuals or as mem¬
bers of society.
Taken as a whole throughout the
world, these groups are chronically
short of basic necessities, and take,
little or no part in the life of the
community.
This state of affairs cannot be
remedied from outside, through
international action alone. Primary
responsibility for defining suitable
policies must rest with Member
States themselves.
Illiteracy cannot be eradicated
without a concerted effort by the
populations concerned.
The integrated development of ru¬
ral areas can only be planned in the
context of regional and national de¬
velopment, including that of towns
and cities.
The status of women cannot be
changed without changing the factors
responsible for their status.
Lastly, these disparities cannot be
eliminated on a global scale unless
young people are directly involved in
social, educational and cultural
action.
Illiteracy and poverty go hand in
hand. In the 25 least developed
countries, where the average annual
income is less than ij> 100, over 80
per cent of the population are illiterate.
What is more, the total illiterate popu¬
lation includes a steadily increasing
number of women: 58 per cent in
1960, 60 per cent in 1970.
If the trends of the last two decades
continue, fewer than 30 per cent of
children aged between 6 and 1 1 in
the 25 least developed countries will
be attending school in 1 985.
The problem of illiteracy has ano¬
ther aspect: a consequence of politi¬
cal and social inequalities, illiteracy
itself can make for inequality. From
the inequities of the colonial system,
there emerged, and still persist, social
and economic systems, certain
features of which (subsistence or
barter economies, social ostracism,
and so on) are no incentive to literacy.
Delays in the adoption or applica¬
tion of agrarian reforms have
weakened the motivation of adult
literates. At times, literacy cam¬
paigns seem hardly capable of ad¬
vancing beyond the experimental or
even symbolic stage.
Furthermore, some literacy pro¬
grammes, although reaching large
numbers of illiterate persons, appear
to have been conceived in response to
immediate requirements for training
semi-skilled labour rather than with
regard to social factors.
Even where literacy programmes
exist, the obstacles encountered often
appear to be insurmountable: lack of
human and material resources; elitist
social structures favouring minorities;
inadequate communications and
transport; multilingualism; lack of
written material, and so on. But the
main obstruction is probably the
absence of a "literate environment".
Literacy work is based on the fact
that exclusively oral communication
is not a sufficient basis for the changes
brought about by any development
process. But literacy training is only
one stage in education and literacy is
pointless unless it leads to further
activities which correspond to the
principles of life-long education.
Unesco's own activities should be
planned and conducted in full aware¬
ness of these ethical, social, economic
and educational considerations.
Most of the 130 million children
between the ages of 6 and 1 1 who do
not attend school and most of the
800 million illiterate adults live in
rural areas. The low level of their
training all too often prevents them
from enjoying the benefits of progress
in science and technology.
This state of affairs has two equally
unacceptable results. On the one
hand, since they lack the guidance
of even the most rudimentary scien¬
tific information, farmers often make
irrational use of soil, water and
vegetation, which may lead to the
collapse of ecosystems, reduced pro¬
ductivity and the exhaustion and
possible abandonment of the land.
On the other hand, the introduc¬
tion of advanced technologies that
are unsuited to local conditions may
also contribute to undermining the
physical foundations of rural life.
The isolation which distance and
the lack of transport facilities inflict on
rural communities is aggravated by
the relative absence of the informa¬
tion media. In the 25 least deve¬
loped countries, for example, where
90 per cent of the population lives
in rural areas, annual newsprint
consumption does not exceed 0.1 kg
per person; in two-thirds of these
countries there is not even one radio
receiver for every 40 persons.
Frequently illiterate, unorganized,
impoverished and sometimes igno¬
rant of the language used for adminis¬
trative purposes, the people of rural
areas are handicapped in coping
with social structures which they do
not understand or which may even
reject them. This being the case,
rural society may become introverted
and in some cases actively resist
change.
Experience has shown, however,
that rural populations can mobilize
their productive capacities for the
sake of their own development, espe¬
cially when it is clear that they
themselves will reap the benefits of
doing so.
The priorities of rural development
include research in agriculture, eco¬
logy and hydrology, together with
the elaboration of techniques suited
to the implantation of small industries
in rural areas.
The expansion of out-of-school
education, including the training of
farm workers and craftsmen, out-of-
school programmes for women and
young people and educational televi¬
sion and radio broadcasts is necessary
to overcome the backwardness of
rural areas and to meet their develop¬
ment needs. Non-academic me¬
thods are particularly suited to the
training of agricultural workers, as
experience shows that such training
is not effective unless it is based on
practice.
Efforts to increase the participation
of women in education and training
must, to be effective, be accompanied
by action affecting certain aspects of
education itself. Educational stan¬
dards and programmes must be freed
from all distinctions based on discri-

PARADISE REGAINED Once upon a time, the story goes, on the banks of a clear pool, the lion saw himself
reflected as a lamb, and the lamb as a lion... If the social and economic inequalities
provoked by poverty disappeared, men might at last see each other as brothers.
mination between the sexes. Simi¬
larly, if the stereotypes and precon¬
ceptions which are largely to blame
for the inequality of women are to be
eliminated, textbooks and other teach¬
ing materials must present a positive
image of women and their role in
society.
Least favoured among young people
are those who live in rural areas. In
most cases, the opportunities open
to them (training possibilities, em¬
ployment and living conditions in
general) are much more limited than
in urban areas, which are the focal
points for industrial development.
Young people in rural areas conse¬
quently suffer from a feeling of iso¬
lation and frustration and are tempted
to leave the countryside for the towns.
In countries currently facing eco¬
nomic difficulties, the growth of un¬
employment, which particularly af¬
fects young people who are looking
for a first job, or who have only
recently started work, combines with
social or psychological difficulties due
to prolonged insecurity (relegation
to the fringes of society, delinquency'
and a sense of futility) to heighten
the traditional tensions between
youth, eager for change, and the older
generation, more anxious for stability.
Young people are, however, ex¬
pressing opinions and convictions on
world issues such as peace, interna¬
tional understanding, human rights
and the struggle against colonialism
and racism which show a common
concern among groups belonging to
different countries and different social
and cultural backgrounds. In many
respects, these preoccupations echo
the efforts currently being made by
the international community to
establish a new world economic and
social order.
Through their willingness to com¬
mit themselves on such matters, and
through the ideas and activities of the
organizations to which they belong,
young people show that their role in
the community must be more than a
passive one: they want their voice to
be heard in decision-making itself.
In the developing countries, the
action taken by public authorities
reflects society's increasingly broad
recognition of the role of young
people in development. The mobili¬
zation of young people has often
been a corner-stone in nation-build¬
ing. In a great many countries,
young people have taken a major part
in the struggle for decolonization,
and their participation in development
is a natural and indispensable conse¬
quence of such involvement.
In a number of industrialized
countries, young people's participa¬
tion in social and cultural life has
increased appreciably in the past few
years. This is borne out notably by
the change in their social and legal
statusin particular the lowering of
the voting age.
Unesco can and should play an
important part in eliminating all
these inequalities which, provoking
tension and social unrest, place the
groups that gain from development
in conflict with those which, irrespec¬
tive of their size, derive little or no
benefit from the process.
In this connexion, Unesco proposes:
1 to adapt literacy programmes to
local conditions, rendering literacy
"functional" in the widest possible
sense of the term, and to encourage
the active, constant involvement of
society in this task;
O to devise rural development pro¬
grammes based on the principle
of. integration and aimed at reducing
existing inequalities;
Q to reveal all the_discriminatory
practices to which women are
subjected in education, science, cul¬
ture and communication and to
encourage women themselves to
work to improve their situation;
4 to encourage young people's
involvement in development stra¬
tegies and to enable them to express
their point of view on society and on
themselves.

### 46542: Man and his environment
MAN AND HIS
IT is sometimes said today that the
triumph of technology has brought
about a divorce between man
and nature, and that this is gra¬
dually undermining a civilization which
neglects the very bases on which its
development must be founded.
The most obvious and frequently
encountered examples of the negative
effects of the changing relationship
between man and his environment
are : imperfect understanding of the
natural systems and mechanisms
which enable life on earth, to continue;
disregard of the unintentional effects
of technology, in particular the va¬
rious forms of pollution; poor man¬
agement of the soil, forests and water;
unbridled consumption of fossil fuels;
uncontrolled urbanization; the rele¬
gation of rural populations to the
fringes of society; destruction of
existing life support systems; and the
crushing of traditional cultures.
In this context, what is frequently
called the "environment crisis" refers
in the first place to the deterioration
of physical and biological surroundings
which is a by-product of the sharply
accelerated expansion of man's dom¬
ination of the planet and, more
particularly, of his unchecked exploit¬
ation of natural resources.
It should also be noted that this
environment crisis is commanding
attention at the very moment when
the necessity for a new international
economic order is becoming apparent
and when the classic forms of deve¬
lopment and the ways and means of
providing technical assistance for
countries in need of it are under
challenge.
There is talk, for example, of a
"crisis of civilization," which people
are trying to remedy by efforts to
improve the "quality of life".
It is no accident that the major
intergovernmental scientific co-operation
programmes with which Unesco is
concerned have developed, mainly
around such disciplines as geology,
ecology, hydrology and oceanography.
These activities are still of para¬
mount importance but the accent is
being laid more and more on inter¬
disciplinary attempts to improve the
quality of the human environment
in general. Increased and decisive
contributions from the social sciences,
the humanities, culture, education
and communication are called for,
as well as close co-ordination of all
these activities.

and financially, two major international
research programmes: the Upper
Mantle Project (1963-1971) and the

### 46542: Man and his environment
ENVIRONMENT
Unesco has developed major programmes of international co-operation concerned with the sciences of geology,
ecology, hydrology and oceanography, as well as with the preservation of the cultural heritage. From works of art
to the tiniest forms of plant life, man's environment and all the living creatures that share it with him have been
adverselyand sometimes irremediablyaffected by the advance of technology. Above, a botanist at the
Timiyazev Agricultural Academy in Moscow examines a larch seedling. Left, restoration of the smaller of two

of Scientific Unions (ICSU). The
results have made it possible, for the
first time, to draw up a comprehen¬
sive account of the evolution of the
earth's crust throughout geological
time.
Ecology and ecosystems
The thin layer of soil, water and
air surrounding our planet, to which
all life is confined and in which man
lives and has evolved, consists of a
number of complex, self-sufficient
units or ecosystems, within which a
certain equilibrium is maintained as
a result of interaction between
communities of animals, plants and
other organisms and the chemical
and physical elements of their habitat.
The key question is, how far can
man go in the manipulation of the
environment? The progressive simpli¬
fication of agricultural ecosystems
carries with it the risk of disruption
and breakdown, since a simplified
ecosystem is generally less able to
resist invasion by pest or disease or
to accommodate unexpected events.
As the size of human populations and
economic activities increase, so does
man's potential for disrupting such
systems.
Resources are limited and unevenly
distributed. The land surface of the
earth, which forms man's habitat,
constitutes about a quarter (some
13,000 million hectares) of the total
surface of the globe. But of this total
only one hectare in ten is arable land
under cultivation. With very consid-
, érable labour and capital investment,
only one additional hectare out of
ten, at present covered by pastures
or forests, could conceivably be
brought under cultivation.
In other words, we are already
making use of the land that is most
productive and easy to exploit. What
is more important is that some of the
land already in use is showing signs
of deterioration. It has been estima¬
ted that about five million hectares
are at present lost for food production
each year, mainly through the
expansion of built-up areas and through
processes such as erosion and salini-
zation.
The urgently required increases in
useful biological production must
therefore be sought through more
rational use of available land resources.
There is an even more urgent need
in all regions for information which
directly links the resource and environ¬
mental problems encountered in a
given area with the social, cultural,
economic and biological characteristics
and aspirations of the populations
which live there.
In short, population-environment- 1

AT the end of the Second World
War it was generally and
sincerely believed that the
universal dissemination of informa¬
tion would be sufficient to ensure
understanding and respect among
peoples and to allay conflicts.
But euphoric optimism about the
"free flow of information" overlooks
certain essential facts, not the least
of which is the uneven international
availability of facilities for press com¬
munication. (Editors' note: A forth¬
coming issue of the "Unesco Courier"
will be devoted to the problems of
communication in the modern world.)
The concept of the free flow of
information has in fact worked to the
disadvantage of countries only
recently freed from various forms of
subjection.
For them, in the last analysis, it has
meant primarily opening the gates to
a flood of information from outside
while they themselves' have been
unable to make their voices heard.
The flow is predominantly from a
small number of technologically
developed and highly industrialized
countries to the rest of the world.
The significant expansion of mass
communication media over the past
10 years has chiefly taken place in
the industrialized world, and over the
decade the gap between developing
and developed countries has actually
widened.
Thus, even though television ser¬
vices now exist in many more coun¬
tries than 10 years ago, in most the
number of television sets
remains small. In some 30 countries
of Asia and Africa there are no tele¬
vision services at all.
In Africa, 9 countries and territories
have no daily newspapers; only 15 of
the remainder have a daily circulation
of more than 10 copies per 1,000 in¬
habitants.
In Asia, daily newspaper circulation
is less than 1 00 per 1 ,000 inhabitants
in 12 countries, and in only 6 does it
exceed 1 00.
In only 7 of the Spanish-speaking
countries of North and South America
does daily newspaper circulation rise
to more than 1 00 copies per 1 ,000 in¬
habitants.
Fifteen countries of Africa, 1 1 Spa¬
nish-speaking countries of North and
South America and 6 Asian countries
have no national news agencies.
It is also clear that the developing
30
countries are increasingly dependent
on the industrialized countries for
access to the books which they most
need for progress in education,
science and culture. This means
that they have to import or translate,
at considerable cost, works published
in the industrialized countriesand
such works, moreover, are not always
suited to their needs.
It is symptomatic that, according to
the latest statistics, approximately
three-quarters of the works translated
throughout the world were originally
written in English, French, Russian or
German (in that order) and that, with
the exception of the Spanish-speaking
countries of Latin America, only 3 per
cent were written in the languages of
the developing countries.
Unesco has identified four major
objectives in the field of communica¬
tion:
I Promotion of a more balanced
flow of information and ideas at
international level, respecting the
various cultures and individual priori¬
ties of each country.
O Promotion of the widest possible
circulation of information, know¬
ledge and ideas, without, however,
neglecting protection for the rights of
creators. Unesco's role here is to
organize the protection of copyright.
It should take into account the educa¬
tional and cultural needs of the inter¬
national community, particularly its
least favoured members, in an effort
to find solutions reconciling authors'
rights and users' interests.
Q In the field of communication
research, Unesco's first task is to
encourage new ways of thinking
about the process of communication
and its role in modern society. Giv¬
en the lack of trained research
workers in some regions, an impor¬
tant area of Unesco's action will
consist of assistance to Member
States in overcoming these obstacles.
A In communication development
the first problem is to prevent any
further widening of the gap between
the developed and developing coun¬
tries. Appropriate conditions and
institutions must be created to allow
for media expansion in the develop¬
ing countries of Africa, Asia and Latin
America, and facilities established for
staff training.
Unesco has a key role to play in
promoting the concept of communi¬
cation policies and helping countries
formulate such policies and put them
into effect.

### 46542: Man and his environment
The promotion of books and reading, the development of communication
media, and the very nature and quality of information itself are occupying
an increasingly important place in Unesco's programmes. Although an
ever-increasing number of relatively inexpensive, good-quality books are
now being produced (above), they remain inaccessible for many peoples.
Audio-visual equipment sometimes takes their place, as in this literacy class
in the Ivory Coast (opposite page) where children and grown-ups are
learning from a television programme.

### 46547: Books for all
Books for all
Without books, the implementation of cultural, educational and
communication policies would be impossible.
Although about 70 per cent of the world population lives in the
developing countries, these countries produce a fifth of the books
published in the world, the remainder being concentrated in about
30 industrialized countries.
Cost is the chief obstacle to the development of book production
in the developing countriesauthors' fees, acquisition of copyrights,
financing of translation, and the cost of manufacture.
The developing countries are obliged to look elsewhere to meet
their home demand, which is increasing with the spread of education
and the advance of literacy. This involves heavy financial outlays.
Moreover, imported books are by no means always suited to the
aspirations of their peoples, most of which could be satisfied by
national authors, who are often obliged to publish abroad because
there is no place for them in the economic pattern of local publishing.
Although the reading public has approximately doubled during the
past 25 years and the number of potential readers continues to grow,
as a result of the population explosion and the general advance of
education, several surveys have shown that, even in countries whose
publishing industry is flourishing, the percentage of those who do not
read books is often high, sometimes exceeding 50 per cent.

natural resources balance is the key
problem area where further information
is required throughout the world.
Although problems concerning the
environment and the utilization of
resources assume a specific form in
different geographic areas of the world,
they should nevertheless be viewed
in their global or regional perspectives,
since the same type of problem is
often shared by several countries.
Information acquired in one country
on how to halt the spread of desert
areas, for example, has a major bear¬
ing on the ecological, economic and
social future of the country concerned,
but is also of obvious interest to
other countries facing similar condi¬
tions and difficulties.
The urgency of the problem of
developing a firm basis for the rational
use and conservation of the resources
of the biosphere and for the improv¬
ement of the relationship between
man and the environment led to the
launching of Unesco's Man and the
Biosphere (MAB) Programme.
This programme provides a major
interdisciplinary focus at the inter¬
governmental level for improving
knowledge of terrestrial biological
resources and interrelationships be¬
tween human activities and terrestrial
ecosystems. The programme, in
which both developed and developing
countries are playing an active part,
has now moved into its operational
phase and is conducted in co-opera¬
tion with the other United Nations
organizations concerned.
The complexity of these problems
calls for integrated, interdisciplinary
research. Natural scientists on their
own can supply only partial and- in¬
adequate answers, and these increas¬
ingly need to be related to social
requirements and conditions.
Natural and social scientists should
therefore participate on an equal
footing in the planning and implemen¬
tation of research projects. In a current
study on the interrelations between
population, environment and resources
in small islands of the Pacific, for
example, the research team includes
ecologists, pedologists, nutrition
experts, human geographers, bio-
geographers and marine biologists.
Water resources
The development of human socie¬
ties, and of the cities where these
societies flourished, has always been
conditioned by the availability of the
water resources essential for their
existence. Despite all its technological
transformations, the modern world
has not changed this immutable law.
On the contrary, the problem of
water has, in our time, assumed new
dimensions, due partly to population
growth but even more to the rapid k
increase in the requirements of f

### 46542: Man and his environment
agriculture and industry and to
urbanization.
The solution of this problem is a
prerequisite of economic and social
development, and calls for the cre¬
ation of special structures in national
administrations. More and more coun¬
tries are facing a crisis concerning
both the quality and the quantity of
their water supply.
In 1975, according to a rough esti¬
mation, the world consumed some
3,000 km3 of water, in other words,
about 70 per cent of the total mean
discharge of the rivers from which
most of the world's renewable water
is obtained.
It is reckoned that between now
and the year 2000 water consumption
will double, rising to about 6,000 km3
per year, or merely a quarter of the
volume of water in Lake Baikal, or
a tenth of the deep ground water
reserves under the North-West Sahara.
Viewed on a world scale, these
figures appear to give no cause for
alarm, but two points should be borne
in mind.
In the first place, doubling the
quantity of water available to users
represents for the world a vast invest¬
ment. Secondly, such investment will
be far greater than that already made
for current utilization, since the yield
from the necessary works will pro¬
gressively decline.
Furthermore, water resources are
very unevenly distributed throughout
the various regions of the world and
in different years and seasons, so that
there are many countries where the
situation is already critical.
The age-old practice of using rivers
and streams as sewers has not only
persisted to the present day, but has
assumed such proportions as to lead
to alarming results.
Subjected, successively, to domes¬
tic, industrial and agricultural uses,
all of which cause varying degrees of
pollution, the same water is finally
required to carry down to the sea all
the organic and inorganic waste ine¬
vitably produced by large population
centres and in particular by industrial
complexes.
These wastes collect in the rivers
and lakes which are no longer able to
destroy them by a natural cleansing
process, so that they even seep through
into the ground water.
The resultant deterioration makes
the water less fit for further use, and
creates a serious threat to public
health while harming the fauna, flora
and natural environment.
The solution of water problems
requires technological, administrative
and economic activities closely related
to the overall development of the
countries or regions concerned. The
programme proposed' by Unesco is
designed to furnish the essential scien¬
tific elements required to provide
guidance for these activités and to
ensure their effectiveness.
The oceans
Unesco must enable its Member
States to acquire the knowledge
necessary for them to exploit the
resources of the oceans in a rational
manner, balancing its various uses in
such a way that long-term survival
and an enhanced quality of life are
ensured.
It must also help Member States to
create the necessary structures, to
acquire scientific knowledge and to
apply that knowledge to the mana¬
gement of man's activities in the
marine environment.
Urbanism and
the quality of life
The man-made environment of
towns and villages is changing with
such ruthless speed that the author¬
ities in many countries confess that
they are powerless to control the
process. The forecast that the popu¬
lation will have doubled by the end of
the century, the advance of indus¬
trialization and the almost universal
trend towards urbanization all combine
to increase this anxiety.
In every case, the increasing density
of urban populations is accompanied
by a radical disruption of the very
fabric of the town. Traditional func¬
tions (communication, trade, political
affairs, leisure activities) are segre¬
gated in different districts. Historic
quarters disappear either as a result
of speculative building projects or
because the overcrowded streets are
abandoned to the least privileged
social categories and quickly deterio¬
rate. Fast transport networks tear the
city apart.
The inability to cope simultaneously
with the use of land, the creation of
jobs and improvements in communi¬
cation systems leads to a steady dete¬
rioration of urban living conditions.
Thus the town, once pre-eminent as
a hub of civilizing influences, is decried
as a place where every form of pollu¬
tion, time-wasting difficulties, segre¬
gation, psychological stress, solitude
and occasionally even danger are
rampant.
The environment is also being rad¬
ically altered by the tourist industry
which, in certain countries, dominates
the private and public building sectors
and destroys the natural balance by
setting up massive installations with
no regard for the sites and traditions
of the population.
Such problems always have insepa¬
rable ecological, social, ethical and
cultural aspects. Physical plans based
on purely economic calculations cannot
solve them.
Pseudo-planning extolled as a pa¬
nacea, still presides over the creation
and management of human settlement
and, astonishing as it may seem, must
share an equal responsibility with
anarchical liberalism for the sacrifice
of the architectural heritage to private
interest or those of State; for the
slow death of rural centres and the
cultures they nurture; for the conges¬
tion of subsidized housing estates in
remote suburbs; the concentration of
offices and factories and the dreary
migrations of workers which they in¬
volve; and, lastly, for the standardized
planning of residential areas in which
the car is king and whose inhabitants
lose both the feeling of belonging to a
community and their cultural identity.
True planning, which cares for the
quality of life, will consider human
settlements as extremely complex
systems requiring patient research in
many different fields if they are to be
dealt with scientifically.
Methods of measuring the quality
of the environment are being devised.
Studies are being conducted on the
social and cultural effects of tourism.
Exercises in programming are being
prepared for those responsible for
environmental matters. Other studies
are contributing to knowledge about
traditional architecture and the pro¬
blems involved in its adaptation to the
needs of present-day life.
Unesco is collaborating with several
Member States in the preservation
and presentation of monuments and
sites, and historic quarters and towns.
Practical experience shows that
operations designed to improve the
environment by what are regarded as
purely technical methods do not
succeed unless they take due account
of interrelationships between men
themselves and between men and
their environment.

Of vital importance in Nepal's campaign
to preserve the cultural and natural heri¬
tage of the Kathmandu valley, the
inventory is the product of a long-term
effort by the Nepalese authorities and
organizations of the U.N. system, includ¬
ing Unesco. (See Unesco Courier, De¬

by the artist and engraver Anatoly Ka-
lashnikov.
'Burgos Man'
One of the most important paleonto¬
lógica! discoveries of recent years was
made in the summer of 1976 by anthro¬
pologists from Madrid University. In a
cave some 15 kilometres from "the
Spanish city of Burgos they unearthed
fossil remains (including a whole jawbone)
some 200,000 to 250,000 years old.
These are thought to be vestiges of late
pithecanthropes (ape-men) or early
Neanderthal men. "Burgos Man" and
"Montmaurin Man" (France) are the
oldest fossil remains of man yet disco¬
vered in Europe.
Flashes
Unesco has added three new LPs to
its "Musical Atlas" recordings of the
world's traditional music: songs and
instrumental music from Hong Kong
and Romania, and of the Peu/ (Fulani)
people of West Africa.
A recently-Inaugurated "European
University of Florence" provides research
courses in history and civilization, eco¬
nomics, law, and political and social
sciences.
Two new Unesco 16 mm colour TV
films portray traditional building in two
African countries. One deals with the
medina of Fez (Morocco) and the other
shows how the people of Mali use mud
to build their houses.
M Children from any of the 18 member
countries of the Council of Europe
studying in another member country are

of an industrial designer in all teams .
planning new factories so as to ensure
visual values that create a harmonious
environment.
The discovery along the Bes-Aryk
River (in Soviet Kazakhstan) of WOO
ancient burial mounds is helping Soviet
archaeologists to establish links between
an early nomadic hunting culture and a

WHO OWNS THE OCEANS?
Sir,
If only you had left out the question
mark in the title of your January 1 977
issue "Who owns the oceans?" Surely
it would have been much better if
WHO (World Health Organization) or
some other international body owned
them for the benefit of mankind.

S.O.S. SEA MAMMALS
Sir,
I began some months ago to call
attention to the plight of a great num¬
ber of sea mammals, which are
threatened with extinction as a result
of hunting, fishing and pollution. I
am writing to you now because this
problem has become critical. Marine
mammals are found in all oceans and
seas, and unless urgent steps are
taken, they are likely to disappear.
Such an event would be a disaster,
especially as the scientific study of
these mammals is only in its infancy,
and we have so much to learn from
them.
Bernard Monier
Cap-Ferret, France
STRESS AND ADAPTABILITY
Sir,
In his article on stress (Unesco
Courier, October 1975), I.S. Khorol
has drawn an accurate picture of the
growing crisis in man's abilities to
adapt to different situations. One
further aspect of this problem, how¬
ever, requires attention.
The author accepts the idea that
everyone has a certain amount of
"adaptation energy", which is reduced
after every stress. It should be point¬
ed out, however, that the amount of
adaptation energy that is used up
depends to a great extent on a per¬
son's reaction to a given stress and
not only on the intensity and duration
of the stress to which he is subjected.
Adaptation energy is expended in
two types of behaviourin "explora¬
tory activity" aimed at changing an
unwanted situation or adapting to it,
and in "refusal to explore", which
leads to unproductive tension, neuro¬
tic alarm and other similar conditions.
The paradox lies in the fact that
although "exploratory activity" requi¬
res a far greater outlay of energy
(heat energy, for example), it leads
less frequently than "refusal to ex¬
plore" to an exhaustion of adaptive
abilities and to illnesses. This may
indirectly confirm the fact that adap¬
tation energy (which cannot at pre¬
sent be measured) is really a special
form of energy which is not derived
from others.
It may well be, then, that the
wounds of those who have not
accepted defeat and are ready for
battle and bent on victory really do
heal faster.

THE CONSERVATION
OF NATURE
Sir,
The problems of nature conserva¬
tion and the use of natural resources
are, together with the problems of
war and peace, arousing serious
concern throughout the world.
I believe that the Unesco Courier,
as an international publication with a
wide readership, could and should
open its pages to a regular column
on nature conservation and the ratio¬
nal use of natural resources, with
articles covering the important and
varied work being carried out in every
country.
This would permit the sharing of
experience and the co-ordination of
efforts to find a solution to the pro¬
blem of the interrelations between
nature and society, which is of such
great importance to the progress of
mankind.
Prof. Khacatur Mirimanyan

Conservation of Nature

EDITOR'S NOTE: Articles on the con¬
servation and rational use of natural
resources appear regularly in the
Unesco Courier, and the issues ol
January 1969 ("Can we keep our
planet habitable?"), January 1973
("Only one earth") and January 1974
("Power from the sun") were entirely
devoted to different aspects of this
problem.
WORLD HUNGER
Sir,
Your issue on world hunger (May
1975) raised a number of questions
in my mind. Should all the peoples
of the world feel guilty in the face of
famine if some of them are neither
capable nor determined enough to
produce maximum food yields through
intensive farming?
Should we all feel responsible if
increasing numbers of children conti¬
nue to come into the world, with
scant regard for the possibilities of
feeding them ? Can it really be God's
will that the earth should become so
overpopulated that only starvation,
wars and natural catastrophes can
redress the balance?
It must be admitted that the indus¬
trially advanced countries have always
exploited the natural resources of the
developing countries for their own
profit, impoverishing these countries
by paying absurdly Tow prices for the
commodities and raw materials extrac¬
ted from them. Compensation has
never filled the gap in value between
goods taken from the developing
countries and goods which the latter
have received.

OSSETS, ETRUSCANS
AND BASQUES
Sir,
A letter in your November 1976
issue from G. I. Kusov describes the
discovery of one of the mysterious
rock-fortresses in the North Ossetian
area of the Caucasus. No less mys¬
terious than these medieval construc¬
tions are the Ossetian people.
About ten years ago there was an
"Ossetic Institute" in France. The
studies it made of the Ossetic lan¬
guage revealed a curious similarity
between certain words in the Ossetic,
French and Basque languages. The
Institute finally concluded that the
Ossets must at some unknown period
have made their way to southern
France, and that the Basques were of
Ossetic origin.
The Institute even considered the
possibility of a link existing between
the Ossets and the Etruscans, ano¬
ther ancient people whose origins are
still something of a mystery.

HARAMBEE
Photo Dwarka Morjaria-Unesco
"Harambee" in Kiswahili means "Pull together!" This expression
might serve as the keynote of the thinking behind Unesco's
plan of action for the next six years, adopted at the Organiza¬
tion's General Conference, held in Nairobi, the capital of
Kenya, from 26 October to 30 November 1976. Mural deco¬
ration above is the work of art students at Nairobi's Kenyatta
University. Combining ancient and modern themes, the
composition is particularly symbolic at a time when the
international community is urgently seeking a new and more
equitable world order.
