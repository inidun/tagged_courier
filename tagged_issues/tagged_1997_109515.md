In August 1947 Unesco began to publish a news bulletin about its activ¬
ities. Its title was the Unesco Monitor, and it was the forerunner of
the Unesco Courier, which began publication in February 1948.
That was half a century ago. Today, leafing through thefifty volumes
of the Cbí/ríerthat stand on our shelves, we can retrace, page by page,
a unique journey through the intellectual history of our time. This
body of reading probably has no equivalent in the international press.
How many magazines can claim to have opened their columns to so many
notable figures from so many of the world's cultures, gradually build¬
ing up over the years a kind of encylopaedia of the age's intellectual
life and its achievements in the sciences and the arts?
All those who have lent a hand are justly proud of their association
with this long and painstaking enterprise. One thing that none of
them can forget is that the Courier's Odyssey is first and foremost
Unesco's. If the Courier has been able to capture and harness the fair
winds of intelligence, it is because they have blowninto Unesco's sails.
What is Unesco's ultimate purpose? Torn between dreams of utopia
and the obligations of an intergovernmental organization, reconciling
the day-to-day demands of hundreds of field projects worldwide with
the principles laid down for it by its founders, does it exist to serve a
thousand different goals or a single one? In this issue we have asked
Alteau, a talented young cartoonist, and Doxuan, story-teller and
humorist, to answer this question in a form that we hope you will find
both visually and intellectually entertaining.
A year ago we gave twenty young cartoonists carte blanche to
draw the image of Unesco as they saw it. In the present issue we
invite readers on a journey of investigation that will take them to the
heart of Unesco and reveal the coherence of the ideals that are its
lifeblood.

BYAKIKOSUEYOSHI
Japanese children's literature came into
being in the second decade of this cen¬
tury. The first literary review to be entirely
devoted to it, Akai tori ("The Bluebird"),
appeared in 191 8. The country was then enjoy¬
ing a period of prosperity, and the liberal cur¬
rent of opinion known as "Taishô democracy"
was in the ascendant. In education, efforts were
being made to develop children's characters and
creativity by introducing them to artistic activ¬
ities, and the emergence of books written specif¬
ically for children seems to have reflected soci¬
ety's sudden upsurge of interest in them. To
begin with, however, the authors were exclu¬
sively male, and women did not play any of
the leading roles in their stories.
Kenji Miyazawa, for instance, ignored
women almost completely. In "Matasaburô
the Wind" (1939), the predominance of male
characters is flagrant. The main character is a
little boy who has just started primary school
in his village. His father features in the story
but his mother never appears, and although the
teacher is not identified, it is evident from the
language he uses that he is a man, while nearly
all the schoolchildren who are named are boys.
There is a similar preponderance of male char¬
acters in "Night Train in the Milky Way",
which tells the story of a young boy's encoun¬
ters aboard a night train, and in "The Life
Story of GusukôBudori" (1941). This imbal¬
ance is understandable in view of the fact that,
at the time, Japanese women had neither real
social position nor employment.

Cow", 1942), the only one of Nankichi

### Japan: breaking the stereotype
" I he emergence of books
written specifically for
children reflected Japanese
society's sudden upsurge of
interest in them."
Niimi's highly popular children's stories to
feature a female character, is particularly illu¬
minating about this situation. The main char¬
acter, who lives with his aged mother and an
equally aged cow, is a good sort, but his fond¬
ness for the bottle all too often leads him
astray. Fortunately, his cow knows its way
home and always brings him back when he is
in his cups, acting in this respect like a prop¬
erly dutiful wife. For that reason, Mr Watarô
has no need of a wife, but the reader learns in
the course of the story that when he was
young he had a beautiful, hard-working wife.
At one point, however, he had by force of cir¬
cumstances to choose between his wife and
his old mother, and he unhesitatingly chose to
separate from his wife, whom he sent back to
her family, and look after his mother.
One of Kusurô Makimoto's children's sto¬
ries, Haha no hi ("Mothers' Day", 1937), is
probably the first to have taken the mother's
role as its central theme. On Mothers' Day,
three children prepare the meal in place of their
mother. She is at first delighted but at the same
time confused, since it is traditionally the
woman's role to do all the household jobs,
and with nothing left to do she soon becomes
bored. The next day, things return to normal
and the mother goes about her work, unques-
tioningly and in silence. The idea that she could
have had a hobby or outside interest seems
never to have crossed the author's mind.
I Women take up thepen
It was not until after the war that things began
to change, when women turned to writing
themselves. The image of motherhood became
more substantial but still remained within the
bounds of the role assigned to mothers by
society.
In Momoko Ishii's Non-chan kumo ni
noru ("Non-chan goes up in the clouds",
1947), for example, a little girl who thinks
that her mother has betrayed her over some
trivial matter runs away from home in tears
and falls in a pond on the surface of which
the clouds are reflected. When she comes'
round, she finds herself on a cloud, where she
meets the old "guardian of the clouds". The
story gives the author a chance to describe a
typical Japanese middle-class family of the
## [Page 8](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/109515engo.pdf#page=8) 🆗
### Japan: breaking the stereotype
time. Non-chan's father is a white-collar
worker and her mother, though a housewife,
is an educated woman and a talented singer. It
later transpires that she would have liked to go
to a school of music, no doubt in the hope of
turning professional, but she is quite happy in
her role of mistress of the house and mother,
and harbours no dreams of venturing outside
the home.
In the 1960s, there was an unprecedented
boom in children's literature. More and more
books were written by women and they con¬
tained more and more female characters the
portrayal of women by women who were
attempting to make young children aware of
what adult life could be like, involving such
unthinkable and absurd events as divorce and
death.
One example of this trend is Chiisai
Momo-chan ("Little Momo-chan", 1964),
which is also the first story to feature a work¬
ing woman. Momo-chan's mother has cho¬
sen to go out to work and has to put her
daughter in a crèche thus proving her to be
a determined woman, since at that time only
the children of single-parent or poor families
were sent to such institutions. Momo-chan's
adventures have remained popular with chil¬
dren and women ever since.
The main character in Toshiko Kanzawa's
Harapcko onabc ("The empty-bellied stew-

pot", 1969) is an old cooking pot who has
had enough of feeding other people and
decides to go off and eat lots of delicious
things, despite the efforts of the other kitchen
utensils to try and stop her. In a postscript, the
author, who is a woman, explains that her aim
in telling this story was to describe the "heart's
never-satisfied yearning" and the "sudden feel¬
ing of emptiness that may come over a house¬
wife who spends all her time working for her
husband and children". The fact that Hara¬
pcko onabe is not a work of realism no doubt
made it easier for Toshiko Kanzawa to express
a housewife's dreams and longings.
Career women and
bluestockings
In the 1970s, it was still difficult for women
to combine housekeeping and a career, and
people still looked askance upon single career
women. Yoshiko Okkotsu's Jttsansainonatsu
("The summer of my thirteenth year", 1974)
shows the stereotyped image of the unmarried
woman as a frigid bluestocking.
Little Rie's mother dies in childbirth, and
her father, a feckless drunkard, starts wom¬
anizing. Rie is taken in by her old aunt, an
unmarried teacher of English, who spends her
time reading weighty tomes in a foreign lan¬
guage and never has a kind word for her.
Finally, Rie can no longer bear the icy atmos¬
phere she lives in and runs away to live with her
father's current mistress, a fat, vulgar, unedu¬
cated hairdresser in a working-class suburb
who nevertheless welcomes her with open
arms.
From the 1980s onwards, it became normal
for women to go out to work and they no
longer had to make the choice between their
job and their home. The fathers who appear in
children's books of this period all fit the
stereotype of the career-obsessed man who
devotes all his time to his work and his busi¬
ness relationships and has no time for his-
home and family. More and more stories about
divorce paralleling what was happening in
society appeared at this time.
In Mama no kiiroikozô ("Mummy's little
yellow elephant", 1985), I told the story of a
divorce from the children's viewpoint. The
couple split up because of the husband's infi¬
delity. The mother then passes her driving test
and buys an old car to broaden her horizons.

husband, but it's not easy. She gets into several
scrapes and even causes a road accident. Her
adventures are presented as comedy, but she is
nevertheless shown as trying to win her inde¬

who is victimized by her husband and family
but whose life revolves around her home. In

of such a woman, tormented by doubts about
the validity of the life she is leading. She is a
conscientious mother who dutifully runs the
household and brings up the children. She has
followed her husband as he was posted from
one place to another, taking charge of the
removal each time and making great efforts to
adapt to each new environment. Her husband
gives her no help around the house. They had

In the 1970s and 1980s, nearly all the chil¬

an interest in women's issues. One of them is
Hiko Tanaka, whose Kalendâ ("Calendar",

lives of "daughters, wives and mothers", with
those of the younger generation, for whom "a

### East Africa: silent partners
East áfrica
Silent partners
BY EVANGELINE LEDI BARONGO
B«>elow(from left to right),
3 children's books from East
Africa: Okot p'Bitek's Song of
Lawino and Song of Ocol, a
study of the conflict between
traditional African cultures
and Western ways; Hare and
Hornbill, an anthology of
stories inspired by the oral
tradition; A Son of Kabira, a
best-seller by Ugandan novelist
Davis Sebukima.
For centuries, children in East African
countries gathered around the fire, usu¬
ally after their evening meal, to listen to sto¬
ries told by their grandparents. Boys learned
about the exploits of brave men and legendary
hunters, while girls learned the secrets of a
successful marriage.
Today this tradition is disappearing. "Mod¬
ernized" stories for children are told in class¬
rooms, libraries and clubs by teachers and
librarians. Many parents and grandparents no
longer have the time to sit around the fire
telling stories, and even if they did, the
extended family is contracting. Most children
no longer live in villages with their grandpar¬
ents but with their parents in cities and towns.
One consequence of these changes is that
traditional stories are being passed down to the
next generation through a growing body of
children's books and the children's sections of
daily newspapers such as the Kampala (Uganda)
New Vision. Most of the books are published
in English, but quite a number are being writ¬
ten in the major African languages, especially
Kiswahili. The stories arc mainly based on
myths, folklore and legends, although some
of them contain sharp social commentary.
The authors tend to use their writing to send
a message to teach, criticize, or try to correct a
social injustice. Most try to help children to
learn about themselves and their community,
explaining how they arc expected to behave now
and when they become adults. Their books are
based on strong moral precepts.
My daughter is my fortune
The image of women as a commodity is pcrva- '
sivc. A Son ofKabira, a popular book by Ugan¬
dan author Davis Sebukima, tells the story of a
preacher, Nanziri, who says of his daughter, "I
shall make a fortune out of her." His attitude is
in line with traditional practice, especially in
rural areas, where daughters may be sold in mar¬
riages that make their parents a fortune.
In the same book, the author describes an
argument between two co-wives about the
best way to celebrate the homecoming of their
husband's son. When the husband intervenes,
he says, "Don't start shouting now, you will
disturb my head. It is as if you were beating a
drum in it." The women immediately stop
arguing and go away because they know their
husband has no interest in what they have to
say. He alone will decide what is to be done.
Solomon E.K. Mpalanyi's Ndikumma
Okolya also shows women meekly accepting
their subordinate role. When one of the char¬
acters tells her friends that her husband mis¬
treats her and probably has a lover, they are
unsympathetic and laugh at her predicament.
They agree that her husband's behaviour is

wrong, but tell her that she must put up with
it as a normal part of married life. In the local
language in which the book was written, they
say, "Take care, friend, your husband can beat
you up with your own stick."
Another image offered to child readers is
that of woman as a family servant. In one story
by Davis Sebukima, a carpenter with two wives
receives a visit from the village chief, whereupon
he calls his first wife and asks her to bring some
beer. The first wife is preparing lunch and so
the carpenter orders his second wife to serve the
beer. She is busy with the housework, but she
stops what she is doing, docs as she is asked
and, as tradition demands, kneels down, fills
the glasses and serves the men. She remains seated
and refills the glasses when the men empty them
until her co-wife brings in the lunch.
The message is that the woman must serve
the man. When the chief arrived, the carpenter's
wives were busy. He was doing nothing and
could easily have fetched the beer himself. But
this is not a husband's job, and so he ordered
his subservient wives to do it for him.
In Fixions, first published in Nairobi in
1969, Taban lo Liyong writes about an old
man so rich that he had married sixty-five
wives who had cost him 8,000 head of cattle in
bride price. Here the author is telling young
readers that a man's wealth, status, prestige

and social respectability are judged by the
number of wives he has. This reflects the tra¬
ditional linkage in this part of Africa between
a man's wealth and the number of his wives. In
a predominantly peasant economy, this is
hardly surprising. The more wives a man has,
the more hands he has at his disposal to labour
in the fields and create wealth for him.
A recent book of talcs for young and adult
readers, IjukaKabumba's The Wedding Ring
and Other Stories (Kampala, 1992) describes a
conflict about land ownership between two
co-wives, Buyanja and Buhcsi. Their husband,
Gyenda, arbitrarily decides that all the land
is his alone and that neither of the wives has
any claim to it. They are to use the land to
produce food and crops to sell, but nothing
must be sold without his permission and any
money they make must be handed over to
him. He is also in charge of their recreation.
"I shall use my discretion to decide which of
you will accompany me to parties," he says.
Another story tells how Buyanja decides to
leave Gyenda and go back to her parents. How¬
ever, her father immediately decides to pack
her off back to her husband, without listen¬
ing to her or consulting his wife.
Both of these episodes underline one of
the dominant male attitudes in Uganda and in
Africa in general: wives, daughters, sisters and

a Western education. Their home is the scene of
a clash between traditional African culture rep¬
resented by Lawino and modern culture rep¬
resented by Ocol. Ocol recites a litany of com¬
plaints against his wife. She can't dance foreign
dances like the rumba and the samba; she has
an old-fashioned hair-do; she still cooks with
firewood instead of a Primus stove; she doesn't
know the names of the months; she doesn't
have a Christian name and is ignorant of the
word of God contained in the "Clean Book"
(the Bible).
Lawino begs her husband to understand
her and to respect their African culture. She
tries to get him to appreciate the beauty of
traditional dances and her Acholi hairstyle.
She tells him that the clay pots she uses for
cooking millet cannot be used on Primus
stoves, and adds that she knows the names of
the calendar months perfectly well, but only
in her people's Acholi language. Acholi names
like hers, she says, arc full of significance
because they convey messages, commemorate
events and bestow honour and recognition
for service to society. Christian names lack this
kind of significance.
The Song ofLawino is a powerful defence
of African culture, especially the culture and
respectability of the African woman, who is
depicted as a conservative traditionalist.
A very different image is presented In
Joseph Buruga's book, The Abandoned Hut
f\ Ugandan schoolteacher

L
^.lùLùL A . ^
(Nairobi, 1972), which portrays the African
woman as a copycat of European cultures, val¬
ues and life-styles.
Buruga tells the story of a man who asks a
woman named Basia why she has rejected him.
Without waiting for an answer he tells her
how he prefers his own culture and hates it
being adulterated by alien values like those
that have "spoilt" her. "Oh, Basia," he laments,
"you rejected me because I do not like your
ways. . . . You want us to go to the houses
[nightclubs] where people gather to drink
colourless liquids which at times look like
blood [red wine]." He explains that he is
against indoor drinking and dancing places
because the dancing keeps people up until the
early hours of the morning and because the
dancers are not involved in making music
(singing, drumming, etc.) but merely dance
to music produced by others. For him, this is
like being visited by spirits or attending the
funeral of a dead friend or relative.
"The Kakwa (African) people drink in the
open under the shade of trees or house veran¬
dahs," he says. "They drink when the sun is
still up in the sky. When night comes, the
drinking party closes until the following day.
The night is the time for night-dancers
(witches) to roam through the villages like
lost bulls."
Here the author is trying to tell his young
readers how important it is to take pride in tra¬
ditional African culture, while also describ¬
ing a widespread social phenomenon at a time
when many young African women frequented
nightclubs, bleached their skin to make it
lighter and wore wigs so that they seemed to
have long hair like European girls.
\ Social change
This image of women is to a large extent a true
reflection of reality. Society, not the authors,
are to blame for this. In recent times, how¬
ever, great strides have been made by women's
organizations and government policies to pro¬
vide greater opportunities for women. In
Uganda, for example, women arc involved in
national development at all levels. There is a
fully fledged Ministry of Women in Devel¬
opment and more than forty women parlia¬
mentarians in a House of some 280 members.
The principle of including women in public
decision-making is replicated in political orga¬
nizations right down to village level. In sum,
the role of women in society is improving
rapidly and spectacularly.
The authors of children's books cannot
fail to be aware of these developments, and it
is to be hoped that they will soon be offering
their readers far more positive images of
women than they have until now. H

### Former USSR: from ideology to love
FORMER USSR
From ideology to love
BY JULIA PROSALKOVA
Mn illustration by I. Bilibin
from a 1900 edition of Lovely
Vasilisa, a Russian folk tale.
rThe picture of women in Russian chil¬
dren's literature before the October
Revolution of 1917 is similar to that found in
Western Europe. At the same time it has its
roots in Russian history, culture and Ortho¬
dox Christianity.
After the Revolution critics rejected this
image almost totally on the grounds of its
extreme sentimentality, and in the 1920s and
1930s made attempts to put children's litera¬
ture on a new footing, using stories inspired
by traditional folklore and classical Russian
literature
These critics, who were themselves out¬
standing writers, had very firm ideas about
the range of themes and styles and the aes¬
thetic and ethical criteria that should be used
in children's books. Writers such as Kornei
Chukovsky dismissed prc-Octobcr children's
literature as "commonplace and bourgeois",
objected to the image of women it projected,
and blackballed the themes of family, parents,
motherhood and love.
These guidelines were dictated by a strong
insistence on a culture dominated by political
and social considerations. The Soviet state
regarded children's books as a powerful instru¬
ment in the ideological education of the rising
generations. "The purpose of Soviet children's
literature is to shape a communist personality,"
wrote I. Motyashov. This was the drawback:
authors had to follow an ideological and edu¬
cational line and were obliged to write within
the official framework.
i Hard-working
mothers
Until the 1960s female characters were por¬
trayed in children's books with a complete
absence of psychological realism, as revealed
in a classic poem by the talented Soviet poet
Sergei Mihalkov, And what about you? A
group of children are sitting in the street on a
summer evening. They are at a loose end, and
to pass the time they start making all kinds of
boasts. One of them brags that his mother is
a pilot. This does not faze the other children,
who in their turn start boasting about their
own mothers' jobs. The mother of one child
is a doctor, another's is a policewoman, a
third's an engineer, a fourth's a teacher, and so
on. Finally the children agree that "We need
all kinds of mothers, they are all important".
But nothing is said in the conversation about
mothers as such, only about their work and
their jobs.
This is not surprising. The new ideology
had liberated women from some of their tra¬
ditional tasks by making the community
responsible for the upbringing of children,
in nurseries, kindergartens, youth clubs and
other institutions. The collectivist mind-set
imposed a pattern of behaviour exemplified
in heroines whose lives were dominated by
their sense of social duty.
Only a handful of books do not conform

£.oya Kosmodemianskaya, a

was held up as a model for
Soviet youth. Above, two

fictionalized biography (1951)
show her as a girl (in 1937)
and as a heroine honoured

to this model and succeed in bringing their
characters to life. Among the schoolteachers,
youth leaders, and two-dimensional mothers
and grandmothers the reader sometimes comes
across a girl or young woman of noble birth,
who experiences all kinds of trials and tribula¬
tions before finding a niche in the new society.
But the critics usually gave this type of heroine
a frosty reception.
From the 1920s to the 1950s women tended
to be portrayed as conventional, insignificant fig¬
ures. There were very few exceptions, the most
remarkable being Arkadi Gaidar's novel Timur
and his Squad. Even today children still love
Timur and his girl-friend Zhenka, a tomboy
who hides the depth of her feelings for Timur.
IHeroic figures
Faithful to the poet Mayakovsky's famous dic¬
tum, "Build life by example", the critics wanted
women revolutionaries and heroines who had
distinguished themselves during the Civil War
or the Second World War, or by "constructive
labour", to be displayed as models for the
younger generation. Authors wrote fictional
versions of the biographies of girls from rich
aristocratic families who had chosen to throw in
their lot with the people and the Revolution.
In the real world, these women led tragic
lives, but in children's books they were
depicted as cardboard figures. Their portraits
were drawn superficially and conformed to a
physical and psychological stereotype. In
appearance they are round-faced, short-haired
and clear-eyed, with resolute chins. In charac¬
ter they are bold, courageous and obstinate.
Little is said about the stirrings of love.
The most notable exception is Ruvim Fraer-
man's The Dingo: A Story of First Love, a
picture of everyday life in the Soviet Union
presented through the story of a teenage girl
and her mother, who is divorced from a hus¬
band whom she still loves. One day the hus¬
band arrives with his new family in the town
where the mother has settled with her daugh¬
ter, who falls in love with her father's step¬
son. The author convincingly shows how
envy, jealousy and the girl's initial hostility
towards the young man gradually turn into a
shy and touching first love.
Lyubov Voronkova, Valentina Osceva and
Maria Prilezhaeva are among the few women
writers who tried to create female characters
that would be credible to the younger genera¬
tion, only to be accused by the critics of senti¬
mentality, antisocial tendencies and philistinism.
The thaw
More realistic portraits of women began to
reappear in the 1 960s, the years of the "thaw".
Female characters started to ask themselves ques¬
tions, to have feelings and to act unpredictably.
From now on their image obeyed a creative
logic and was drawn with greater literary skill.
Authors became more responsive to their per¬
sonal inspiration rather than to the official line.
Women ceased to be merely iron-willed crea¬
tures faithfully performing their social duty
and began to be depicted as tender, homely and
absorbed in their children's affairs. Women
teachers became more feminine and Young Pio¬
neer leaders stopped speaking in slogans.
The change was largely due to the arrival on
the scene of a new generation of young writers
born after the Revolution. They kept official
ideology and the educative conception of chil¬
dren's literature at arm's length, and introduced
a new style and new subject-matter. Their por¬
traits of women were closer to everyday life,
more profound and more authentic.
In "The Thirteenth Year of Life", Sergei
Ivanov created two original female characters,
a good-hearted and pretty thirteen-year-old
girl and her mother, an intelligent woman.
The mother, who has married for the second
time, loves "the free life" more than anything
else, and thinks of herself as an attractive young
woman absolved from family obligations. The
selfishness of the mother is contrasted with her
daughter's attachment to the family home.

women's involvement in working life gave rise

### Former USSR: from ideology to love
to psychological stories in which women and
children are presented as victims. Mothers'
lack of participation in the upbringing of their
families is seen as a cause of juvenile delin¬
quency and the cruelty of neglected children
left to their own devices. Problems such as
extreme poverty and family conflicts are
described for the first time.

their drunkard husbands, work as cooks and
do dirty jobs. Real-life experience in the Soviet
Union is here seen in a bitter light.
In the 1980s women's personal problems
and their relations with the world around
them come to centre stage. Girl heroines are
portrayed with greater physical realism and
psychological complexity.
The awakening of adolescent feelings is the
theme of R. Pogodin's The Oak Grove. In
this story whose gawky young heroine is not
yet a woman, but has ceased to be a child, the
author describes all the complexities and con¬
flicts of a teenager who is at once lighthearted
and frank, lyrical and lucid.
One of the best children's books published
in the late 1980s, Yuri Koval's Wormwood
Tales was inspired by the author's memories of
his mother and grandmothers. Written in sim¬
ple, poetic language, it vividly evokes the hap¬
piness of childhood, when mother and her
love arc always there.
Grandma's return
The symbolic popular figures of Russian folk¬
lore have also made a comeback, notably the
grandmotherly figures who are called "babas"
in our villages. In Russia, the "baba" has always
been associated in children's minds with the
idea of stability, and serenity, warmth and
patience, generosity and kindness.
One of the characters in Pogodin's novel
"Where the Goblin Lives", a lonely old
woman named Vera, would have been incon¬
ceivable in a book written between the 1930s
and the 1 960s. She spends her life looking after
other people's children, wherever they come
from, as if they were her own. Her last act,
when she is almost blind and is starting to
lose her mind, is to save the novel's young
heroes, who are on the verge of starvation, by
sacrificing for them her beloved rooster, the
only living creature in her dilapidated home.
With great generosity and love, an old peas¬
ant woman in Pogodin's story "Where do the
rainclouds come from?" rescues a city boy
from the solitude of orphanhood. She shares
with him her sense of the oneness of human¬
ity and nature. "I have killed a toad," the boy
tells her one day. "How can it live when it is so
ugly?" She docs not scold the child, but goes
out of the cottage, returns with a big stone
and puts it on the bench in front of him.
When he asks what it is for, she says: "You
might need it. I too am ugly."

### North America: mothers and daughters
North america
Mothers and daughters
BY ELKE LIEBS
I There is no such thing as the archetypal
I North American woman. She is as
many-sided as the continent itself, a vast
fusion of races and religions. All the same,
books for children and adolescents provide
an interesting overview of the expectations,
projected desires and anxieties of young peo¬
ple as they confront the older generation.
These books featuring parents and children
offer insights into what is considered socially
representative and generally acceptable or unac¬
ceptable.
However, the realism of this type of liter¬
ature is limited. It is a setting for encounters

story describing a strong

between many-faceted realities, where con¬
flicts arise and solutions are sometimes found.
Above all these situations stimulate us to
think about our own identity and that of
others, about cultural differences and shared
values.
\A lust for life
^LjKI'1
These shared values might be generally defined
as "lust for happiness" or "lust for life". We
even find the theme of lust for survival in Vera
and Bill Cleaver's book, Where the Lilies
Bloom (1969). This is the story of a fourteen-
year-old girl who, after the death of her
mother and father, makes superhuman efforts
to bring up and hold together a large family,
thereby fulfilling a promise that she has made
to her dying father. The strength of character
that she deploys in the process would honour
an adult woman but it also consigns her to
great solitude.
The ideal in this book is that of the family,
whose life-giving and life-supporting func¬
tion is made abundantly clear. Led by the ener¬
getic Mary, the children collect rare medicinal
herbs which they sell to make a living. The
story ends when Mary's sister starts a family
of her own. The two girls have very different
characters and ideals. Mary is brave and has
disciplined herself to be so hard and unselfish
that childhood and youth pass her by. Her
very virtues deprive her of what she most
needs the love of others. Her sister is gen¬
tle, pretty, conciliatory and indecisive in all
matters except for her decision to marry.
The fact that the roles of the sisters are
reversed at the end of the novel raises the ques¬
tion as to whether these two images of woman
arc mutually exclusive in the author's mind.
They certainly provide a striking demonstra¬
tion of the psychologist Erich Fromm's the¬
ory that a person must first learn to love him-
or herself (and accept the love of others) before
becoming capable of loving others. The same
principle applies to the family. This story deals
with two kinds of survival physical and

above all psychological for a girl, a young
woman, a human being and a family.
In / Would Rather Be a Turnip (1971)
another story by the same two well-known
authors of children's books, the family is seen
in a different light. After her mother's death,
twclvc-ycar-old Annie lives alone with her
father and an extremely wilful black house¬
keeper until the housekeeper's nephew, who
was born out of wedlock, moves in with them.
Annie's hatred of the intruder is expressed in
eloquent fantasies, as when she writes a "novel"
about an illegitimate child being thrown into
a dustbin. Unlike Mary, Annie is able to sub¬
limate her fantasies of violence and eventually
she saves the life of the once-hated new fam¬
ily member by shooting a bull that is threat¬
ening him. Through this symbolic act, she
liberates herself from the constricting world of
her prejudices and doubts. The little nephew,

who is exceptionally gifted and far more
mature than she is, has long since won her
over and passed on to her his own love of
reading. She comes to understand that the
word "family" does not necessarily only
describe a blood-relationship.
Keep your cool is the rule
Awakening sexuality is another common
theme in literature for adolescents. At first it
is surprising to see how naturally twelve- to
fourteen-year-old girls use an erotic vocabulary
which still, absurdly, sometimes makes their
mothers blush. But this linguistic ease hides a
lack of real experience. In most cases, the greater
their skill with words, the greater their fear
of what lies behind them. But that fear must
on no account be admitted. Keep your cool is
the rule. So all these girls dream of the kind of
great love affair they have seen on television and
arc bitterly disappointed when they have their
own first emotional experience. What's more,
they can expect little help from their mothers.
We often come across the stereotype of parents
who arc desperately worried if their fourteen-
year-old daughter has not yet dated any boys
but are dismayed when she falls in love.
Patty Dann's book, Mermaids (1986), for
example, which has been turned into a highly
successful film, seems to me symptomatic of
this conflictual situation that many American

### North America: mothers and daughters
mothers impose on their daughters. Fourteen-
year-old Charlotte is familiar with her mother's
many relationships with men and makes ironic
comments about them. As a psychological
defence, she goes on a purity trip and decides she
wants to become a nun. Unfortunately, she is
also her mother's daughter and is constantly
falling in love. Despite her "experience", she
thinks she is pregnant after her first real kiss.
Erotic and religious fanaticism culminate in a
scene where she bares her breasts to the crucifix.
As George Bernard Shaw said about his Saint
Joan, she is "in love with religion".
Adolescents still occasionally go through
such phases today. But the situation in this
story becomes implausible when mother and
daughter both develop a crush on the same
man; when the mother's concern for her
daughter's welfare is confined to cynical com¬
ment; when she takes a malicious delight in
stealing her daughter's first love (making Char¬
lotte weep for the first time in her life); and

### North America: mothers and daughters
when she does not even want to come into
the house with the father whom her children
long to see on his only visit, an incident which
verges on disaster.
The real message of this contradictory
book remains somewhat obscure. What we are
shown is a distorted picture of emancipation,
psychological neglect and sarcasm which pre¬
vents us from experiencing clear feelings. Just
three sentences are devoted to fourteen-year-
old Charlotte's first physical experience with
a much older man.
Fortunately, families aren't always so
neglectful in adolescent literature. In Lois
-, Lowry's short story, Anastasia Krupnik
(1979), Anastasia is treated with understand¬
ing by her educated and sensitive parents (her
father is a professor and her mother an artist)
when she rebels against the arrival of her baby
brother, whom she hates. Arguments between
the parents are worked out with humour and
mutual respect, even in the presence of their
ten-year-old daughter.
In one particularly moving scene, the daugh¬
ter questions her mother in great detail about her
first experience of love. This conversation is
coloured with a striking mixture of timidity
and frankness. Love, pain, disappointment,
death, weakness and strength are discussed in
simple language that even a little girl can under¬
stand. This story makes a pleasant contrast with
many others in which children and adolescents
are ignored when they ask questions and arc
told that they should know the answers to all
their problems by the time they are fourteen.
Down-and-out in Boston
Poverty is another subject which increasingly
appears in adolescent literature. In Lois
Lowry's Taking Care of Terrific (1983) the
heroine and her girlfriends decide to bring a lit¬
tle happiness into the lives of a group of poor
old women by taking them boating in one of
Boston's parks.
In other stories the protagonists are them¬
selves confronted with poverty. In Norma
Fox Mazer's novel Silver (1988), a fourteen-
year-old girl lives in a mobile home with her
mother, who works as a cleaner and has a
younger boyfriend. The general atmosphere
is one of mutual understanding and frank¬
ness. Then the daughter starts working secretly
as a house-cleaner to help her mother make

ends meet. She gets to know other girls and
finds out that life always holds problems,
sometimes big ones. One of the girls is forced
to endure sexual abuse in her rich uncle's house.
Her moral shame contrasts sharply with the
modest pride of the mobile home dwellers.
Here romanticism mingles with blunt social
criticism in a way that is neither Utopian nor
convincingly realistic. Yet the story docs cap¬
ture a slice of life that faithfully reflects what
is happening in America today.
Another theme is the experience of Jewish
immigrants in the United States, as it was
shaped partly by poverty and the ghetto and
partly by the events of the Second World War.
Judie Angell's book One Way to Ansonia
(1985), which opens in 1899, contains a nuraj
ber of fascinating portaits of women of dif¬
ferent ages. They have a hard time adapting to
their new culture and face problems that arc
due to the weight of their own culture's patri¬
archal traditions and customs. Once again, the
women demonstrate remarkable resourceful¬
ness. The main character displays boundless
energy in her battle to acquire education and
assert her identity. With her child in tow, she

leaves her family, returning later as an indepen¬
dent woman who is now capable of experienc¬
ing happiness.
Getting their man
After reading a number of books for young
people it is surprising to sec how many girls
and women believe that they must attract a
boy or a man, not from a position of inde¬
pendence and emancipation, but in order to
catch him and get him under their thumb.
The reader may well be surprised by the
extent to which these women depend on accep¬
tance by men. To keep the man they love, they
are apparently prepared to put up with arro¬
gance, rudeness and boredom, as well as being
lectured to and told how to behave. Hilda Col-
man's Notfor Love (1983) dishes up all the tired
stereotypes of American girlhood: a pseudo-
harmonious parental marriage based on indif¬
ference; interest in clothes, parties, sports and
boys, and anxiety at the emptiness of vacations.
It takes the political commitment of a man
friend extremely handsome of course to lead
the main character, Jill, in a different direction
and to remain true to her new ideals even when
her mentor seems to let her down.
Another book, Dear Lovey Hart, I am
Desperate (1 975), is more subtle. In her capac¬
ity as the university newspaper's "Miss Lonely
Hearts", a female student gradually comes to
understand the differences between superfi¬
cial and deeper feelings, conflicts and solu¬
tions. In the process she learns about herself
and her own contradictions.
The mothers portrayed in these two books
are another striking example of the clear-cut

### North America: mothers and daughters
contrasts that still typify the image of the aver-
rage woman. They are either helpless and resigned
or thoroughly self-assured, hard-working and
co-operative. They show respect and under¬
standing (or indifference) to their grown-up
daughters. When it comes to love affairs, the
daughters hardly ever turn to their mothers, as
if they fear incomprehension or rivalry.
But for the most part these women of all
ages are imaginative, energetic and determined
to make sense of their lives. In the final analy¬
sis, all the stories discussed here convey a sim¬
ple message: never give up the search.
" D ooks for children and
adolescents give a good idea
of what young people think
about their elders."

In accordance with its mandate, Unesco

explores many different fields, calls for
standard-setting instruments, training,

THE UNESCO
Sexist schoolbooks
A teaching guide entitled Down with
Stereotypes! shows how sexist models
which belittle women are transmitted
from generation to generation. Most of
the messages conveyed to pupils,
students and children by school
textbooks and children's literature do
not take into full account the fact that
women's life patterns have changed
significantly in recent decades.
Women from different cultural,
social and traditional backgrounds have
proved that they can not only follow roles
and careers which have been traditionally
reserved for men, but that they can
contribute new outlooks and methods to
them. However, this change has not been
fully reflected as yet in school textbooks
and children's literature; nor has men's
increasing participation in roles and
careers which have been traditionally
regarded as reserved for women.
Some school textbooks and
children's books still convey messages
which are largely false and out-of-date.
They do not encourage or consolidate
the changes that are taking place and are
not adjusted to the new situations. The
goals of the United Nations Decade for
Women (1976-1985) were to promote
equality between men and women;
women's participation in development;
and women's contribution to the
strengthening of peace.
Courier july-august 1997
It has thus become urgent to eliminate sex stereotyping in school education and
to see that schools endeavour to promote positive and egalitarian attitudes
between the sexes. This idea has been reaffirmed on several occasions, notably
at the World Conference of the United Nations Decade for Women (Copenhagen,
July 1980), which urged governments "to take all necessary measures to
eliminate stereotypes on the basis of sex from educational material of all
levels". When strategies for the advancement of women were adopted at the
World Conference to review the Decade (Nairobi, July 1985), it was
recommended that "studies on women's contribution to all aspects of
development" be included in school curricula. The Report of the Fourth World
Conference on Women (Beijing, September 1995) identified as a critical area of
concern "stereotyping of women and inequality in women's access to and
participation in all communication systems, especially in the media".

The Report stresses that "the continued projection of
negative and degrading images of women in media
communicationselectronic, print, visual and audiomust
be changed. Print and electronic media in most countries do
not provide a balanced picture of women's diverse lives and
contributions to society in a changing world. In addition,
violent and degrading or pornographic media products are
also negatively affecting women and their participation in
society. Programming that reinforces women's traditional
roles can be equally limiting."
Changes can only occur when those responsible for the
conception, writing, illustrating, editing and interpretation of
school textbooks and children's literature are convinced that
the perpetuation of stereotyped sex roles and images does
have negative effects on society as a whole.

ZKRR and LBRZ
are members of a team of extraterrestrial
Q space explorers. As our story
\begins, they have investigated r>
. \ all the planets except /
\ \ one-Planet Earth. /
The two little extraterrestrials are
equipped with a powerful device
(the facial encryption unit) that
enables them to move around the
human world incognito. Only our
readers can see them as they
really are.
ZKRRisthe
smarter of the
two. He takes his
mission very
seriously.
LBRZ is more of a
goofball. His head is
always in the stars.
This is Mr. ZWR, a wise old patriarch.
As he nears the end of his journey
through the universe he is still baffled
by the mystery of the small blue planet.
our friends aboard their flying saucer
succeed in unlocking the secret of this
unknown world? Read on to find out. . . .

### Declaration by Federico Mayor: the human right to peace
d«i,,.t Federico Mayor
THE HUMAN RIGHT
TO PEACE
"The purpose of the Organization is to contribute to peace and security by promoting collaboration among
the nations through education, science and culture in orderto further universal respect for justice, forthe
rule of law and for the human rights and fundamental freedoms which are affirmed for the peoples of the
world, without distinction of race, sex, language or religion, by the Charter of the United Nations."
( C(» IN ST I T 1 T I O l\ O ! II INK SC O, A K T I C I. K I)
Lasting peace is a prerequisite for the exercise of all human
rights and duties. It is not the peace of silence, of men and
women who hy choice or constraint remain silent. It is the
peace of freedom and therefore of just laws of happiness,
equality, and solidarity, in which all citizens count, live together
and share.
Peace, development and democracy form an interactive tri¬
angle. They are mutually reinforcing. Without democracy,
there is no sustainahle development: disparities hecome unsus-
tainahle and lead to imposition and domination.
In 1995, the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations and
UlSESCO and the United Nations Year for Tolerance, we stressed
that it was only through a daily effort to know others better and
respect them that we would he able to tackle at source the
problems of marginalization, indifference, resentment and
hatred. This is the only way to break the vicious circle that
leads from insults to confrontation and the use of force.
We must identify the roots of global problems and strive,
with imagination and determination, to cheek conflicts in their
early stages. Better still prevent them. Prevention is the victory
that gives the measure of our distinctively human faculties.
We must know in order to foresee. Foresee in order to prevent.
We must act in a timely, decisive and courageous manner, know¬
ing that prevention engages the attention only when it fails.
Peace, health and normality do not make the news. We shall
have to try to give greater prominence to these intangibles,
these unheralded triumphs.
A universal renunciation of violence requires the commit¬
ment of the whole of society. These are not matters of govern¬
ment but matters of State; not only matters for the authorities,
but for society in its entirety (including civilian, military, and
religious bodies). The mobilization which is urgently needed to
effect the transition within two or three years from a culture
of war to a culture of peace demands co-operation from every¬
one. In order to change, the world needs everyone. A new
approach to security is required at world, regional and national
levels. The armed forces must be the guarantors of democra¬
tic stability and the protection of the citizen, because we can¬
not move from systems of complete security and no freedom to
systems of complete freedom and no security. Ministries of war
and defence must gradually be turned into ministries of peace.
Dccision-makingprocedures and measures to deal with emer¬
gencies must be specially designed to ensure speed, co-ordina¬
tion and effectiveness. We arc prepared for improbable wars
involving thelarge-scale deployment ofinordinalely costly equip¬
ment, but we are not equipped to detect and mitigate the nat¬
ural or man-provoked disasters that occur repeatedly. We an; vul¬
nerable to the inclemency of the weather, to the vicissitudes of
nature. The protection of the citizen must be seen as one of the
major tasks of society as a whole if we really wish to consoli¬
date a framework for genuinely democratic living. Investing in
emergency help and relief measures and above allin preven¬
tion and the long term (for example, in continent-wide water dis¬
tribution and storage networks) is to be prepared for peace, to
be prepared to live in peace. Currently, we are prepared for
possible war, but find ourselves surprised and defenceless in our
daily lives in the face of mishaps of all kinds.
The United Nations system must likewise equip itself with
the necessary response capacity to prevent the recurrence of
atrocities and instances of genocide such as those which today
afflict our collective conscience Cambodia, Bosnia and Herze¬
govina, Liberia, Somalia and Rwanda...
There is today a general desire for peace, and we must applaud
the clear thinkingand strength of mind displayed by all the war-
ring parlies in the accords that have been reached in El Salvador,
Namibia, Mozambique, Angola, South Africa, Guatemala and the
Philippines. These agreements (ill us with hope hut also sad¬
ness, when we think of the lives sacrificed on the long road to
the cease-fire, and of the open wounds, so difficult to heal. Thus,
as we revive the concept of the "construction of peace in the

### Declaration by Federico Mayor: the human right to peace
minds of men", we now call on all adversaries who still put their
trust in weapons to lay down their arms and seek reconciliation.
Condemnation will not suffice. It is time for action. It is
not enough to feel outrage when we learn of the number of
children exploited sexually or at work, of refugees or of those
suffering from hunger. We must react, each of us to the best
of our abilities. It is not just a matter of looking at what the gov¬
ernment is doing. We must part with something of "our own".
We must give, give of ourselves. We must stop imposing mod¬
els of development, models for living. The right to peace, to live
in peace, implies jettisoning the belief that some are virtuous
and correct while others are wrong, and that some are always
giving while others are always in need.
It is clear that we cannot simultaneously pay the price of war
and the price of peace. Guaranteeing lifelong education for
all would enable us to: control population growth, improve the
quality of life, increase civic participation, reduce migratory
flows, level out differences in income, assert cultural identity
and prevent the destruction of the environment through sub¬
stantial changes in energy use patterns and urban transport; pro¬
mote endogenous development and the transfer of knowledge;
foster the swift and effective operation of justice, with appro¬
priate machinery for international co-operation; provide the
United Nations system with appropriate facilities to tackle
transnational problems in time. None of this can be achieved in
a context of war. What is needed, then, is to reduce the invest¬
ment in arms and destruction in order to increase investment in
the construction of peace.
Education by example
The distillation of traditions, thoughts, languages, forms of
expression, memories, things forgotten, wishes, dreams, exper¬
iments, rejections, culture finds its supreme expression in our
everyday behaviour. Infinite cultural diversity is our great
resource, which is underpinned this is our strength by uni¬
versal cultural values that must be passed on from the cradle to
the grave. Family members especially mothers teachers, the
media, everyone must help to spread the ethical principles, the
universal guidelines that are so necessary today for haves and
have-nots alike: the latter because they have a right to the basic
minimum standards that human dignity demands; the more for¬
tunate because material goods fail to deliver the expected plea¬
sure. Where there is no longing, possession brings no enjoyment.
In education, tools are useful. But nothing can replace the
friendly words of a teacher, or the caresses and smiles of parents.
The only real education is education by example . . . and love.
Learning without frontiers whether geographical, or fron¬
tiers of age or language can help to change the world, by
eliminating or reducing the many barriers that today impede
universal access to knowledge and education. Education must
help to strengthen, reclaim and develop the culture and iden¬
tity of peoples.
Globalization carries with it a danger of uniformity and
increases the temptation to turn inwards and take refuge in all
kinds of convictions religious, ideological, cultural, or nation
alistic. Confronted with this threat, we must "emphasize the
forms of learning and critical thinking that enable individuals to
understand changing environments, create new knowledge and
shape their own destinies". Indigenous peoples must be placed
on an equal footing with other cultures, participating fully in the
drafting and application of laws. Peace means diversity, a blend¬
ing of "hybrid, wandering cultures" as Carlos Fuentes put it;
it means multi-ethnic and multilingual societies. Peace is not
an abstract idea but one rooted firmly in cultural, political,
social and economic contexts.
Eliminating violence
Above all, this profound transformation from oppression and con¬
finement to openness and generosity, this change based on the
daily use hy all of us of the verb "to share" which is the key to
a new future cannot be achieved without our young people,
and certainly not behind their backs. We must tell them they
who represent our hope, who are calling for our help and who seek
in us and in external authorities the answers to their uncertainties
and preoccupations that it is in themselves that they must dis¬
cover the answers, that the motivations and glimpses of light that
they are seeking can be found within themselves. Although at
times it may be difficult, given both their consternation and our
own, to present the situation to them in those terms, our position
as lifelong teachers and learners obliges us to say to young people,
as Cavafy put it in a poem: "Ithaca gave you the journey. . . . She
has nothing left to give you now". Each according to his own plan.
Each according to his own way of thinking. Free from self-serving
outside interference, especially when it robs the young of their own
"core", the intellect, talent and resourcefulness which are the most
precious individual and collective treasure of humankind. Sects
and the escape provided by drug addiction are the clearest symp¬
toms of this pathological state of mind that is our great problem
today. Indeed, education means activating this immense potential
and using it to its fullest so that each may become the master and
architect of his or her own destiny. We cannot give to youth what
we no longer possess in youthful vitality but instead we can offer
what we have learned through experience, the fruit of our failures
and successes, of the burdens, joys, pain, and perplexity and the
renewed inspiration of each new moment.
Let youth hold high the banner of peace and justice! So con¬
vinced am 1 of the relevance of this goal to the proper fulfilment
ofour mission that I have proposed to the General Conference that
it designate "UNESCO and youth" as a central topic for discussion
at its next session. That will be an appropriate moment since the
General Conference will be considering for adoption the "Decla¬
ration on the Safeguarding of Future Generations".
At all the United Nations conferences, regardless of the sub¬
ject under consideration (environment, popidation, social devel¬
opment, human rights and democracy, women, housing), there
has been a consensus that education is the key to the urgently
needed change in the direction pursued by today's world, which
is increasing disparities in the possession of material goods and
knowledge, instead of reducing them. To invest in education is not
only to respect a fundamental right but also to build peace and

progress for the world's peoples. Education for all, by all, through¬
out life: this is the great challenge. One which allows of no delay.
Each child is the most important heritage to be preserved. U\KSC()
may at times give the impression that it is only interested in pre¬
serving stone monuments or natural landscapes. That is not true.
Those efforts are the most visible. And the heritage thus safe¬
guarded the least vulnerable. But we must protect our entire
heritage: the spiritual, the intangible, the genetic heritage
and, especially, ethics. These are the basic, universal values that
our Constitution sets forth with inspired clarity. If we sincerely
believe that each child is our child, then we must radically change
the parameters of the "globalization" currently underway. And
the human being must become the beneficiary and main actor of
all our policies and strategies.
A system collapsed in 1989 because, concentrating on equal¬
ity, it forgot liberty. The present system focused on liberty, will
know the same fate if it forgets equality and solidarity. The
din made as the "Iron Curtain" collapsed drowned out the
tremor that ran through the foundations of the "winning" side
in the Cold War. We must, then, for the sake of both principle
and self-interest, redouble in every field the fight against exclu¬
sion and marginalization. We must all feel involved. We must all
work to ease the great transition from the logic of force to the
force of reason; from oppression to dialogue; from isolation to
interaction and peaceful coexistence. But first we must live, and
give meaning to life. Eliminating violence: that is our resohe.
Preventing violence and compulsion by going, as 1 said before,
to the very sources of resentment, extremism, dogmatism and
fatalism. Poverty, ignorance, discrimination and exclusion an;
forms of violence which can cause although they can never jus¬
tify aggression, the use of force and fratricidal conflict.
Swords into ploughshares
A peace consciousness in the interests of living together, of sci¬
ence and its applications does not appear overnight, nor can
it he imposed by decree. First comes disillusionment with
materialism and enslavement to the market, and then a return
to freedom of thought and action, sincerity, austerity, the
indomitable force of the mind, the key to peace and to war, as
affirmed by the founders of UlNKSCO.
Science is always positive, but the same cannot always be
said of its applications. Advances in technology and knowledge
can be used to enrich or to impoverish the lives of human
beings; they can help to develop their identity and enhance
their capacities or, on the contrary, they can be used to under¬
mine the personality and coarsen human talent. Only conscience,
which is responsibility and thus ethical and moral can make
good use of the artefacts of reason. Conscience must work in tan¬
dem with reason. To the ethics of responsibility we must add
an ethics of conviction and will. The former springs from knowl¬
edge, and the latter from passion, compassion and wisdom.
We are now approaching the end of a century of amazing sci¬
entific and technological progress: we can diagnose and treat
many diseases which cause suffering and death; we communi¬
cate with extraordinary clarity and speed; we have at our dis
posal instant, limitless information. However, antibiotics and
telecommunications do not compensate for the bloody con¬
flicts which have cut down millions of lives in their prime and
inflicted indescribable suffering on so many innocent people. All
the obscenities of war, brought home to us nowadays by audio¬
visual equipment, do not seem able to halt the advance of the
huge war machine set up and maintained over many centuries.
Present generations have the almost impossible, biblical task
of "beating their swords into ploughshares" and making the
transition from an instinct for war developed since time
immemorial to a feeling for peace. To achieve this would be
the best and most noble act that the "global village" could
accomplish, and the best legacy to our descendants. With what
satisfaction and relief should we be able to look into the eyes
of our children! It would be also the best way to celebrate the
fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human
Bights, in 1998.
Other "rights" have been added since 1918. These should
all be taken into account, and to them should he added the right
which underlies them all: the right to peace the right to live
in peace! The right to our own "personal sovereignty", to respect
for life and dignity.
Constructing the defences
of peace
Human rights! At the dawn of the new millennium, our ideal
must be to put them into practice, to add to them, to live and
breathe them, to relive them, to revive them with every new day!
No one nation, institution or person should feel entitled to lay
sole claim to human rights, still less to determine others' cre¬
dentials in this regard. Human rights can neither be owned nor
given, but must be won and deserved afresh with every passing
day. Nor should they be regarded as an abstraction, but rather
as practical guidelines for action which should be part of the
lives of all men and women and enshrined in the laws of every
country. Let us translate the Declaration into all languages;
let it be studied in every classroom and every home, all over the
world! Today's ideal may thus become the happy reality of
tomorrow! Learning to know, to do, to be and to live together!
I appeal to all families, educators, religious figures, parlia¬
mentarians, politicians, artists, intellectuals, scientists, craft-
workers and journalists, to all humanitarian, sporting and cultural
organizations and to the media to spread a message of toler¬
ance, non-violence, peace and justice. Our aim must be to foster
understanding, generosity and solidarity, so that with our minds
more focused on the future than on the past, we may be able to
look ahead together and build, however difficult the conditions
or inhospitable the setting, a future of ¡peace, which is a fun¬
damental right and prerequisite. Thus, "We, the people" will
have fulfilled the promise we made in 1915, our eyes still seared
by the most abominable images of the terrible conflict that had
just ended "to save succeeding generations from the scourge of
war", "to construct the defences of peace in the minds" of all the
peoples of the Earth.

I "The day the Sarajevo Library
burned down, in 1992, and
the ashes rained gently down over
the city," says Maja Barlich, a staff
member of Bosnia and Herzegov¬
ina's Institute for the Protection of
the Heritage, with sadness in her
voice, "everyone was crying, as if
they had lost someone dear to
them."
The magnificent Viennese-style
building which stood on the edge
of the Ottoman quarter, grandly
embodying the city's cultural iden¬
tity, spirit and history, was
destroyed by the fury and accurate
shelling of fighting men. The ruins
did not, however, remain silent for
long. Music soon took possession

the strictly classical architecture and
the ochre and pink mansions, now
windowless or unsafe, serve as a
reminder that this was part of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire until
early in the century. Then comes the
fifteenth-century Ottoman quar¬
ter, Bascarsija with its maze of
medieval lanes and the oriental
charms of Slatilo cose, the "Sweet
corner", so called because of its
many pastry shops. This old neigh¬
bourhood was relatively little dam¬
aged and soon came back to life. Its
shops reopened quickly, and the
imposing Begova Disrinja mosque
is being rebuilt.

beating regularly.
Unlike its illustrious neigh¬

the library, the National Museum
and the Oriental Institute. A whole
segment of Bosnia and Herzegov¬
ina's memory has been wiped out."
The selection of targets and the accu¬
racy of fire produced terrible results:
universities, schools, research estab¬
lishments, museums and the finest
of the Austro-Hungarian mansions
were systematically targeted. The dif¬
ference in the amount of damage
done to religious buildings is no
coincidence: the Orthodox church
and cathedral seem to have survived
unscathed but some of the mosques
in the Ottoman quarter were heavily
bombarded. Some of the old resi¬
dential neighbourhoods also suf¬
fered badly; many houses that were
thought to have been spared were in
fact hit by shells.
Piecemeal

Sarajevo is no longer entirely a
wasteland. "The city has been chang-

ing very rapidly of late," explains
Francis Bueb, the founder of the
André Malraux Cultural Centre,
which was set up while the war was
still raging. "The streets have been
cleaned up, the rubble cleared, the
burned-out cars removed and the
broken windows replaced." The
reconstruction of Bosnia and
Herzegovina has begun, albeit on a
modest scale.
The rebuilding of the cultural
heritage may seem to be of sec¬
ondary importance to the major
institutions which are hard at work
finding funds for urgent small-scale
projects, but for the people who
live here, the return to normality
also involves the rebuilding of their
cultural identity. "Destroying our
heritage was a way of denying our
existence", says Maja Barlich. "The
cultural monuments and sites have
to be restored in order for us to
recover our national traditions and
identity."
Lack of co-ordination
Urgent action is needed. Winds can
be very violent in Sarajevo and can
hasten the collapse of weakened
buildings, while the lack of co-ordi¬
nation in international reconstruc¬
tion efforts is hampering opera¬
tions. Since the Dayton agreement
was signed, such efforts have
increased in number but there has
not been enough co-ordination,
some countries financing operations
without knowing whether or not
other countries have already drawn
up estimates for the same project.
This lack of co-ordination is pre¬
venting full realization of the objec¬
tives: Austria, for example, with the
help of European Union funding,
has undertaken the cleaning and
protection of the library, but no-
one knows who will be responsi¬
ble for the next stage of the opera¬
tion (the total cost of which has
been reckoned at around $14 mil¬
lion). Discussion has begun as to
whether the library will recover the
literary, cultural and historical func¬
tions it had before the war or be
assigned other functions of a more
administrative nature, such as it had

### Sarajevo's battered soul
in its early days. The debate is sure
to be lively, in view of the build¬
ing's symbolic importance.
The political make-up of Bosnia
and Herzegovina is scarcely con¬
ducive to making the country's cul¬
tural reconstruction any simpler:
each of the ten districts composing
the Muslim-Croat Federation, for
instance, has responsibilities in the
field of culture, but some districts
have no suitable structure to dis¬
charge these responsibilities.
On the road to
reconstruction
"At present there is no interna¬
tional-level order of priorities," says
Colin Kaiser. "The precise extent of
damage to cultural property in the
Muslim-Croat Federation is
unknown and, apart from exten¬
sive damage to religious buildings
mosques and Catholic churches
little is known about the situation
in the Serb Republic. This is why
we want to set up a forward-look¬
ing programme for the reconstruc¬
tion of the country's cultural her¬
itage." Unesco is due to send a
mission to Sarajevo in the near
future for that purpose.
For the time being, the main
project is for the rehabilitation of
the old town of Mostar, a pro¬
gramme financed by the Italian gov¬
ernment, and for the restoration of
a mosque, also in Mostar, funded
by Saudi Arabia.
In October 1996 UNESCO,
which has already been playing a
part in the refurbishment of the
National Museum, organized a sem¬
inar on the reconstruction of the
cultural heritage, enabling interna¬
tional experts to work alongside
Bosnian student architects and local
engineers. "There were 35 local par¬
ticipants and experts from all over
the world," explains Sibyl Renaud,
administrative officer in UNESCO's
Sarajevo office. "They worked on
two cases in Sarajevo the library
and the old Ottoman quarter and
three building sites in Mostar."
According to French architectJ.-
L. Taupin, a historic monuments spe¬
cialist who took part in the seminar,
"coexistence is working well. We can¬
not imagine the reconstruction of
Sarajevo without the city's history
being taken into consideration."
heritage has been
hard hit by recent
events in that
country.
Here Ylljet Aliçka,
Chief of the Foreign
Affairs Department
of the Albanian
Ministry of Culture,
Youth and Women's
Affairs, talks to
Jasmina Sopova.
The pictures coming out of
Albania since March 1997 show a
country in turmoil. The media
report army barracks being
sacked, automatic rifles being
freely toted around, curfews
being imposed, European soldiers
being landed for Operation Alba,
snap elections being called and so
on, but not a word about culture.
Ylljet Aliçka: In times of trouble,
unfortunately, culture is not
regarded as a priority inside the
country any more than it is out¬
side. The damage that is being
inflicted on Albania's culture is per¬
haps less serious than the economic
harm it is suffering, but it is
irreparable: in time the economy
will recover, but artefacts bearing
witness to centuries of culture will
have disappeared forever.
What is the bill for the damage?
Y. A.: It is hard to say with any cer¬
tainty at present, just as it is hard to
say what is the motivation behind
it: is it wanton destruction or delib¬
erate looting? The estimated cost of
damage to cultural property amounts
to around $800,000. Many municipal
buildings, cinemas and museums
have been wrecked. The Tirana Fac¬
ulty of Agriculture, which was par¬
ticularly well computerized, has been
plundered, and some 400,000 books
have gone up in flames.
Is there a parallel here with
what happened to the Sarajevo
library?
Y. A.: No, the books were not
burned for the same reasons. In Sara-
jevo the aim was to destroy a cen¬
turies-old heritage that was shared
by the different communities, to
wipe the slate of history clean. In
Albania, where the different ethnic
groups have historically lived
together in harmony, I would say
the burning of the books led on
from the street fighting. The books

in the municipal libraries were
destroyed together with the library
buildings, and the Faculty of Agri¬
culture's huge collection disappeared
together with its computers. There
was no political motive behind the
destruction of the books.
What about the museums?
Y. A.: The Dürres Archaeological
Museum was seriously damaged and
eighty objects dating from the Illyr-
ian period were stolen, but the
inventory was preserved and will
perhaps make it possible to track
the objects down later, when the
country has dealt with its most
urgent problems. The case of
Butrinti, on the other hand, is far
more serious: this ancient site,
which was included on UNESCO's
World Heritage List1 in 1992, was
ransacked, its museum looted and
its records burned, so that no inves¬
tigation is possible. Being in the
south of the country, the site is for
the time being inaccessible to the
authorities.
So the looting will go on. . . .
Y. A.: Maybe, but the public is
starting to react, which is a very
encouraging sign. While some peo¬
ple are plundering and devastating
everything they come across, others
risk their lives to save whatever can
still be saved: a well-known film¬
maker, for example, personally
stood out against the attack on the
Tirana Cinematographic Centre,
and a librarian was killed when she
tried to protect the books in the
Berat municipal library. In both
Berat and Korcha men and women
took up arms to defend the
medieval icon museums, and many
of the icons arc now under protec¬
tion in private hands.
We do not, however, have the
resources to establish a strategy for
the protection of our cultural her¬
itage, which is why we have just
appealed for support to the Coun¬
cil of Europe in Strasbourg and
why we shall shortly be turning to
UNESCO and other international
institutions.

### Forests: a breathing space for the planet
orests:
a breathing
space for
the planet
by France Bequette
Forests are the earth's most
complex and elaborate natural
ecosystems. They cover about 10
per cent of the planet's surface and
26 j>er cent of the continental sur¬
face area (excluding Greenland and
Antarctica). The globe's biggest pro¬
ducers of hiomass, they exercise
great influence on energy exchanges
between the atmosphere and the
ground, intercepting solar radiation,
acting as a windbreak, fixing carbon
dioxide and returning a great deal
of water vapour to the atmosphere
via évapotranspiration. They are
directly dependent on the climate
and also one of its main regulators.
THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
Some 300 million years ago forests
of tree ferns and giant horsetail cov¬
ered the earth. Traces of them can be
found in coal deposits. Then the
oceans submerged the continents.
When the water retreated about 260
million years ago, conifers appeared,
followed some 130 million years later
by broad-leaved trees.
In the Tertiary era, about 50 mil¬
lion years ago, the northern hemi¬
sphere had a mild climate that was
propitious for the development of

plant life and was brought to an end
hy the onset of an Ice age. The fate
of vegetation was strongly influenced
hy the location of mountain chains.
Europe's east-west mountain mas¬
sifs prevented the migration of
plants, and tropical and sub-tropi¬
cal species died from the cold. In
the Americas on the other hand the
mountains run on a north-south axis
and presented no such obstacle. East
Asia had no Ice age and a large num¬
ber of species survived there and
later successfully reacclimatized to
places where they had once pros-
pered. This explains why the parks
and gardens of Europe contain maid¬
enhair, magnolia, maple and cherry
trees imported from Asia.
There are four major types of
forest (boreal-conifer, temperate-
broad leaf, scrubland and rain for¬
est). Conifers are dominant in the
boreal forest, from Alaska to

Labrador and from Scandinavia to
Siberia and Kamchatka, interming¬
ling with birch, willow and aspen.
The dark foliage of pines contrasts
with the white trunks of birches,
and the grass between the trees is
splashed with the colours of a thou¬
sand flowers. In the temperate zone
of the Northern hemisphere it is
too hot in the Southern hemi¬
sphere the appearance of the for¬
est changes with the seasons. The
slender trunks of oaks, elms and
maples form lofty groves of trees
crowned with intertwining branches.
Their leaves change colour from
light to dark green, then to the golds
and reds of autumn before falling to
the ground. On stony or sandy soils in
regions with Mediterranean or Cali-
fornian climates grow leathery-
leaved trees like the olive, succulent
plants such as cactus and the dense
scrub known as garrigue, maquis and
Olive trees in
Andalusia
(Spain).

### Forests: a breathing space for the planet
chaparral. In tropical areas the lux¬
uriant forest demands an even heat
and plenty of rain throughout the
year. The trees reach for the sky in
search of sunlight, sometimes climb¬
ing to 50 or 60 metres amidst a tan¬
gle of lianas and epiphytes.
A CARBON RESERVOIR
We know more than we did about
the interactions between forest and
climate, but they still give rise to
debate among specialists. Gilbert
Aussenac of the French National
Institute of Agronomic Research
(INKA) believes that the forest is a
more effective sunlight trap than
any other plant formation. Heat
stocked in the morning is restored
to the atmosphere in the evening.
When it conies into contact with
humid air hovering above the for¬
est, it causes rainstorms.
In order to show that the rainfall
regime is strongly influenced by the
forest cover, scientists have made a
model of the total deforestation of
the 5-million-km Amazon basin. In
this hypothesis the temperature of
the air would rise by from Io to 3°C
because of the fall in évapotranspi¬
ration, which would also result in a 26
per cent decrease in rainfall!
Less well known, but vital for the
future of the earth's climate, is the
relationship between the forest and
the increase in atmosjiheric carbon
dioxide (CCL). The concentration of
CO¿ in the earth's atmosphere has
risen from 280 volumes per million
(vpm) at the beginning of the indus- Temperate
trial era to 360 volumes today. This deciduous forest
in Canada,
is a staggering increase when com¬
pared with the 80-vpm rise that
took place in the 200,000 preceding
years, as calculated from measure¬
ments made in niicrohubhles con¬
tained in polar ice. The ligure may
well double by the middle of the
next century.
Forests play a dual role in the
earth's carbon cycle by absorbing a
large amount of the C02 contained
in the atmosphere and also by emit¬
ting C02. The biosphere and the
atmosphere annually exchange enor¬
mous amounts of carbon. The annual
flow of atmospheric C02 fixed in
plants by photosynthesis amounts to
some 100 billion tons, but this is
almost entirely counterbalanced by a
reverse flow caused by the breathing
of plants and micro-organisms in the
soil such as bacteria and fungi, which

decompose ground litter and organic
matter. If, for the moment, forest
ecosystems are fairly good sponges
for absorbing the CO., which we pro¬
duce and which helps them to grow,
they will no longer be able to do so if
emissions continue to increase and
deforestation is not halted.
DEFORESTATION
According to the Food and Agricul¬
ture Organization of the United
Nations (FAO), which is carrying out
a Forest Resources Assessment Pro¬
gramme, forests covered some 3,454
million hectares world-wide in 1995,
somewhat more than half of which
were located in developing countries.
Retween 1990 and 1995 the world's
forests underwent an estimated net
loss of 56.3 million hectares, com¬
prising a loss of 65.1 million hectares
in developing countries partly offset
by an increase of 8.8 million hectares
in the industrialized countries. For¬
est loss was not, however, as great as
predicted and has decreased overall.
Some communities have no
choice but to contribute to defor¬
estation. In dryland and upland areas
exposed to erosion, for example,
needy communities chop down the
sparse trees to provide fuel, food
and a meagre source of income.
Other contributory factors are over¬
grazing, extensive farming and fire
the scourge of dry forests of the
£ Mediterranean variety.

PLASTIC PLANTS
Plastic exists naturally, albeit
in minute amounts, in the leaves
of many plants, including cotton
or mustard, but is far more
expensive to extract than pro¬
duce synthetically. However,
scientists now hope to increase
the plastic production capac¬
ity of certain plants through
genetic engineering, so that
some commercially grown
species such as sweet corn
could become veritable "plastic
factories". But there are still
many imponderables, and so far

1980 and 1987, it is thought to
be responsible for a steep rise
in respiratory ailments, heart
disease and skin allergies. The
World Bank and the United

harvested too frequently, weak¬
ening trees which have also
been threatened by a harmful
fungus since 1992. In 1996 a
Belgian organization called Le
Petit Liège (The Little Cork)
launched an operation to col¬
lect all discarded cork objects
for recycling. Cork is a good
heat and sound insulator, and
after being ground is used in the
building industry. Recycling of
this kind could help take the
{pressure off cork oaks in
France, Spain and Portugal.
ENVIRONMENT-FRIENDLY
CHEWING GUM
Fed up with finding pieces of
chewed gum stuck on chairs,
desks and even statues in pub¬
lic: places, an American inven¬
tor has patented a new kind of
chewing gum that turns brittle
when discarded and can be eas¬
ily removed from surfaces. The
gum will also dissolve in the
mouth after a period of chew¬
ing and can even be swallowed
without disagreeable after¬
effects.
HEAVY
EATERS
In the United States a number
of sites contaminated by heavy
metals are awaiting rlcanup
measures. But traditional soil-
washing technology is cosily and
impoverishes the soil, and as a
result there is growinginterest in
plant-based soil-cleansing tech¬
niques. Two scientists are exper¬
imenting with plants called
hyperaeeiimulators, which may
do the job less quickly but are
far more economical, environ¬
ment-friendly and effective.
Ilyperaccumulatora can absorb
metallic and other pollutants in
concentrations from 10 to 100
times the accumulation of a
metal tolerated by ordinary
crops. A small shrub called
Alpine pennycrcss (Thlaspi
caerulescens), for example,
digests zinc, cadmium and
nickel; and carrots absorb DDT
(see "Initiatives" in the U\HSC()
Courier, November 1996). The
scientists even wonder whether
some hyperaeeiimulators could
be used to farm metals as an
alternative to mininii! H

FISHERIES
Serious pollution and heavy
overfishing are endangering the
marine resources of the Caspian
Sea. In Iran, for example, stur¬
geon catches are 75 per cent
down on 1984. After cutting its
quotas by half, Iran has drawn
up a sturgeon hatcheries devel¬
opment plan designed to boost
caviare production. It has also
concluded agreements with
neighbouring countries to
determine catch shares and
control poaching. Certain types
of net are being outlawed, and
the potential of some fish
species for human consumption
is beins reassessed. I

An expanded and updated tw o-

1 -volume English edition was
first published in 1993. The
study examines food resources,
food production and consump¬
tion and the cultural founda¬
tions for food choices and devel¬
opment strategies. The English
edition contains 74 scientific
articles about the daily lives of
people living in tropical areas,
their habits, their beliefs and
their understanding of the for¬

EARTHWORM FERTILIZER
The French Institute of Scien¬
tific Research for Development
in Co-operation (ORSTOM), the
University of Sambaljpur (India)
and an Indian fanning company
havepionecred the use of earth¬
worms to replace fertilizer on tea
plantations. The earthworm is a
useful ally because it enriches
the soil by its droppings which
are rich in minerals (nitrogen and
phosphates) and humus. By
making tunnels it improves soil
drainage and aeration. It also
stimulates the fungi that live in
symbiosis with tea-bush roots
and promotes water, nitrogen and
phosphorus absorption. The
selected worms, which belong to
a particularly active local vari¬
ety, are raised on the plantations.
The results speak for themselves:
tea production has risen by 35
to 240 per cent depending on the
site, and consumption of chemi¬
cal fertilizer has been halved.I

### The Divine faces of Teotihuacán
HERITAGE
the divine faces of
EOHHUACÁN
by Cécile Romane
After a century of archaeological
investigation, the remains of the city-state of
Teotihuacán (Mexico) still guard many of their
secrets. This pre-hispanic site, the largest in
Mesoamerica, was included on Unesco's World
Heritage List in 1987.
In the absence of written
I records, the history of
Teotihuacán, the former capital
of the greatest pre-Columbian
urban civilization in the Valley of
Mexico (2nd to 7th centuries),
lying forty kilometres north of
Mexico City, is still shrouded in
mystery.
It was founded late in the first
century A.D., although the date
cannot be definitively confirmed
in the present state of archaeo¬
logical excavations. It extended
over 40 square kilometres and
boused a sizeable ¡population. The
number of inhabitants is esti¬
mated to have ranged from
100,000 to 160,000, depending
on the period.
After reaching its apogee
between the fourth and fifth cen¬
turies, it suddenly faded away,

tury. We do not know the exact
reason why this culture died out,
but its decline is thought to have
been hastened by changes in the
ground water level and hence in
the availability of water supplies.
The original name of ihe city is
unknown. The Aztecs called it
Teotihuacán (the "city of the
gods") when they discovered its vast
nuns centuries later. It seemed to
them so imposing that only the gods
could have built it and that they
had created the Fifth Sun there
(see the ÜMW.O Courier, "The sun,
ancient myths, new technologies",
January 1995, p. 12).
THE CEREMONIAL CENTRE
A straight 40-metre-vvide high¬
way, known as the Avenue of the
Dead, runs for more than two kilo¬
metres in a clearly visible succes¬
sion of rectangular squares, all on
the same level with access stair¬
ways. It then continues for
another three kilometres, still
straight as a die, but with less for¬
mally structured adjoining archi¬
tecture. This grandiose prospect
was flanked on either side by over

Most of the monuments in
Teotihuacán's ceremonial centre
which, vast though it is, represents
only 10 ¡percent of the city's total
area, stood on this Avenue. The
most imposing of all, the Pyramid
of the Sun (225 x 222 metres at
the base), is the world's third
tallest pyramid. Located on the
east side of the Avenue, it now
rises to a height of around 63
metres (it was originally 75 metres
tall) and has a volume of one mil¬
lion cubic metres.
The less colossal but equally
massive Pyramid of the Moon (150
x 140 metres at the base and 42
metres high) stands at the northern
end of the Avenue of the Dead and
consists of four superimposed plat¬
forms, each set back from the oth¬
ers. The palace of Quetzal jiapalotl,
the mythical Bird-Butterlly, lies
on a square precinct in front of
this ¡pyramid. The bird-butterfly

South of the Avenue of the
Dead rises the immense quadran¬
gular structure of the "Citadel"
with a side length of around 400
metres and a total surface area of
just under seven hectares. The
square which it forms is delimited
by four ¡platforms (mistakenly
believed by the Spaniards to be the
walls of a fortress). It could easily
accommodate 100,000 ¡persons.
Here stands the Pyramid of
Quetzalcóatl, or the Plumed Ser¬
pent. The monumental steps of
its Western facade have been ¡pre¬
served in excellent condition. The
typical feature of Teotihuacán
architecture is clearly visible
here. This is known as the "talud-
tablero" (slope-and-panel) system,
i.e. an alternation of inclined
embankments and vertical ¡panels,
generally adorned with bas-reliefs.
On its four sides, the ¡pyramid
bears 366 heads of Quetzalcóatl.
These take the shape of circular
¡projections with impressive gap-
ingjaws.
AN INFLUENTIAL CIVILIZATION
The city was designed to harmo¬
nize (dosely with the surrounding
('ountr)side. From the. centre of
the Avenue of the Dead, the sum¬
mit of the nearby mountain, the
Cerro Gordo, can be seen tower¬
ing up above the apex of the Pyra¬
mid of the Moon. The city has a
rigorously geometrical layout. The
ceremonial centre was built around
the North-South axis of the
Avenue of the Dead. The adminis¬
trative ('entre, the market and the
"citadel" lie on an East-West axis.
The layout of the religious and
¡priestly monuments, all lying in the
axis of the Pyramid of the Sun,
which coincides with the sun's rise
to its zenith, respects an astro¬
nomical logic. The cult of the sun

and the study of the ¡planets must
have been of very great importance
to Teotihuacán society.
This rigidly hierarchical soci¬
ety, which lived from trade, was
headed by a theocratic govern¬
ment. The city derived its wealth
from vast deposits of obsidian and
fertile soil. The social classes were
clearly separated according to
their ¡profession: potters, ¡painters,
gemstone ¡polishers, farmers, fish¬
ermen, etc. Teotihuacán was a cos¬
mopolitan centre, its population
consisting of different ethnic
groups living in different districts.
The most important economic,
religious and ¡political centre of
all Mesoamerica, it reveals a
sophisticated knowledge of geom¬
etry, architecture, astronomy and
art. The mythological scenes fig
uring in the ¡paintings which adorn
the ¡palace walls, the layout of the
buildings, reflecting astronomical
rather than military concerns, lead
us to supposes that this civiliza¬
tion, founded on the cult of ter¬
restrial and agrarian deities, was a
peaceful one.
Its influence was felt through¬
out Mesoamerica: two-thirds of
Mexico as we now know it.,
Guatemala, Honduras and Belize.
The art of ¡tottery and ceramic
ware, in ¡particular, left a lasting
mark on the cultures of the Mayas
and Oaxaca. This influence lasted
for a long time. For centuries,
other populations continued to
adore the gods of Teotihuacán:
Quetzalcóatl, the Plumed ser¬
pent, god of humidity and fertil¬
ity, and Tláloc, the rain god.

Excavation and restoration
The first excavations began in 1884. In 1905-1910, some monuments were restored, e.g. the Pyra¬
mid of the Sun to which the architect, Leopoldo Batres, arbitrarily added a fifth level. The
"citadel" was discovered and restored in 1917-1920.
Since 1962, archaeological research has been co-ordinated by Mexico's Instituto National de
Antropología e Historia (INAH). More systematic exploration of the site led to the discovery of
the Palace of the Quetzal Bird-Butterfly and other edifices. In the early 1970s, a natural cave orga-
nizedinto rooms joined by tunnels was discovered beneath the Pyramid of theSun.This was a cer¬
emonial setting, but the symbolic function of the edifice, which played a central role in the reli¬
gion ofTeotihuacán, is still unknown. Perhaps it symbolized the mythical centre of creation.
In 1980 Mexico began a far-reaching excavation and consolidation campaign, the Teotihuacán
Archaeological Project, in which 600 people worked for two years under the direction of Ruben
Cabrera of the Mexican National Institute of History and Anthropology. The project, concentrated
mainly on the south of the Avenue of the Dead, revealed vestiges of later strata than theTeoti-
huacán civilization.
Excavations confined to the Pyramid of the Plumed Serpent (1917, 1925, 1939 and 1982) led
to the discovery of tombs containing skeletons and offerings-obsidian objects, figurines in hard
stone and sculpted shells. In 1988-1989 the QuetzalcóatlTemple project, a joint ventureinvolv-
ing Mexican and American archaeologists, explored previously unstudied parts of the citadel. Then
in 1994-1995 strata subsequent to the Teotihuacán period were removed during a new Mexican
campaign. About 200 tombs were discovered in the pyramid itself, at its exact centre, in graves
under the floor and at the corners.
In 1973 René Millón of the University of Rochester (United States) began mapping the
entire site as part of the Teotihuacán Mapping Project. In his opinion the Pyramid of the Moon
may contain an inner structure, but the monument has not yet been decoded. C R.

The Fifth International Conference
on Adult Education
"Adult learning: a key for the 21st century" is the motto of Unesco's Fifth
International Conference on Adult Education (COFINTEA), which is taking place
from 14 to 18 July in Hamburg (Germany). The Conference, organized by Unesco
with a number of international partners, is continuing the work of four earlier
Unesco adult education conferences: Elsinore (Denmark, 1949), Montreal (Canada,
1960), Tokyo (Japan, 1972) and Paris (France, 1985).
A major part of the discussions at Hamburg will focus on the theme of
democracy, i.e. making access to education more democratic and promoting
democracy through education. This theme links with that of promoting a culture
of peace and mutual understanding-something that is more necessary than ever
in a world where nationalities and linguistic and ethnic communities are
increasinglyinterpenetrating one another.
The most immediate outcome of the Conference will be two documents: a
Declaration on Adult Learning, in the form of a broad policy manifesto; and an
Agenda for the Future, containing a series of more detailed proposals.

field. In Germany, for example,
only 1.5 ¡>er cent of adult educa¬

MEDIA AND TECHNOLOGIES
FOR EDUCATION
Radio and television have long
been used in distance learning.
Now videos, interactive compact
discs and the Internet are ¡proving
to be immensely valuable educa¬
tional tools. The Internet has also
opened up vast ¡possibilities for
education, and its potential has
only just begun to be exploited.
With an Internet link it should
eventually be possible for some¬
one to take anything from a liter¬
acy course to a study programme
in advanced engineering. Already
there are courses where students
link up via the Net to hold regular
"virtual reality seminars" and to
carry out joint study projects.
However, there are serious
drawbacks to the Internet. For
vast areas of the developing world
access to it is either non-existent
or limited, and where it exists it is
often too costly for most citizens.
On the other hand, if the Inter¬
net becomes more widely used,
there is a real danger that it will
be an instrument for transferring
the values, languages and cultural
norms of the industrialized North.
Even with a full connection, it is
difficult to use the Net system¬
atically for educational purposes.
Those who attempt to do so are
often overwhelmed by the sheer
chaotic multiplicity of informa¬
tion that surges back and forth
over the information highway.
In the twenty-first century the
¡public must learn to become
active, critical and discriminating
users of the media. In ibis way
they will resist ¡political and com¬
mercial manipulation and be able
to use the media intelligently for

### Letters from Asia
Letters from Asia
l)v Denis Sinor
To communicate by means of
the written word, two con¬
ditions have to be fulfilled:
the sender and the recipient of the
communication must be familiar
with the same language and the same
script. In early and medieval Inner
Asia circumstances did not favour
the simultaneous existence of both
conditions.
In the past, there were far more
languages than there arc today. This is
a worldwide phenomenon, the rea¬
son for which lies in a steady increase
in populations which brings closer to
one another peoples once separated
by great distances. In the process, the
languages of the smaller peoples tend
to disappear; their speakers are
absorbed by a majority population
using another tongue. There is rea¬
son to believe that in Eurasia alone in
historical times hundreds of lan¬
guages disappeared, many of them
without leaving any written trace.
Others have survived in documents
now extremely difficult to decipher.
At the beginning of this century in
the relatively small area of what is
today the Chinese province of Xin¬
jiang, texts written in seventeen dif¬
ferent languages were discovered.
Most of these ceased to be used many
centuries ago.
Yet in the past, though less than
today, people of differing languages
had to communicate, and the only
way to do this was, for some of
them at least, to have command of
more than one language. While it
has always been possible for indi¬
viduals to acquire several languages
through learning, in earlier epochs
multilingualism was usually a by¬
product of a child's family circum¬
stances. In Inner Asia and elsewhere
such individuals often came to serve
as interpreters or translators.
The function of interpreters is
aural and oral: what they hear in one
language, they transpose into
another. The function of transla¬
tors is similar, but they use visual
and manual means. They read a text
in one language and write it down in
another. The need to communicate
by vision as opposed to audi¬
tion requires the simultaneous
command of more than one lan¬
guage and, in many cases, more than
one script. It was on competence in
such skills that cross-cultural com¬
munications depended.
WRITING FOR A MULTILINGUAL
READERSHIP
Few people were literate in the
period and in the lands with which
wc are concerned, hence correspon¬
dence between them must have been
sporadic and, as might be expected,
very few specimens of writing have
survived.
It often happened that several
scripts were used within one lin¬
guistic community. Old Turkic,
Uighur texts have survived in a num¬
ber of scripts and it is by no means
certain that even literate speakers
within that same group could read all
of them. Further complications arose
when people using different lan¬
guages and different scripts wished
to communicate with each other.
It may happen that one sender
wishes to communicate with a
number of recipients. Before the

### Letters from Asia
E FLECTI O
Letter from the Mongol Khan
Giiyiikto King Bêla IV of Hungary
"I, the Khan, envoy of the Heavenly King who gave me power over
the world to exalt those who submit themselves and to subdue
the adversaries, I wonder at you, king of Hungary, that, when I had
already sent three times ambassadors to you; why did you not
send back to me any of them. Nor did you send me your
ambassadors or letters. I know that you are a rich and powerful
king, that you have many soldiers under your command and that
you rule alone a big kingdom. Therefore it may be difficult to
submit yourself to me. However, it would be better for you to
submit yourself spontaneously to me. I understand moreover that
you keep under your protection the Cumans, my servants. I thus
enjoin you not to keep them with you, and for their sake have me
as an enemy; because it is easier for them to escape than for you.
For they, without homes and on continuous move may perhaps
evade, but you, who live in houses and have forts and cities, how
shall you escape from my hands?"
Sogdian script developed from Ara¬
maic; and Chinese characters were
used for the Chinese version. Texts
written in six languages (Sanskrit,
Tibetan, Mongol, Chinese, Uighur
and Tangut) and six scripts were used
in the Buddhist inscription of 1345
at the Chii-yung gate near Beijing.
There arc good reasons why
most of the still extant letters of
Inner Asian origin were written by
rulers to rulers. Though illiterate
themselves, they had at their dis¬
posal scribes who could write on
their behalf, and their writings had
a fair chance of being preserved in
the archives of the recipient.
The first problem that must have
beset the recipient of any diplomatic
letter must have been caused by the
script in which it had been written.
Thus the credentials presented to the
Emperor Justin II by the Turkish
ambassador Maniakh, who reached
Byzantium in 568, were said to have
been written in the "Scythian script"
(a general Greek term used to desig¬
nate peoples of the steppe). Unfor¬
tunately, we have no further infor¬
mation on this script.
On occasion there must have
been difficulties in finding a trans¬
lator. Such was the case in 1 267 when
Pope Clement IV could find no one
to translate the Mongol letter sent
to him by the il-khan Abagha, the
Mongol ruler of Iran. It appears
from the Pope's letter to Abagha
that previous correspondence had
been conducted in Latin, a reference
which would suggest that Euro¬
peans, perhaps missionaries, were
active in the il-khan's chancery.
THETORTUOUSWAYSOF
TRANSLATION
In the first half of the thirteenth
century the Mongol empire
expanded well into eastern Europe
and it became necessary for those
concerned to establish some rela¬
tions with each other, to exchange
some letters. The finest pieces of
medieval diplomatic correspondence
emanating from Inner Asia are the
letters scntby the Mongol rulers
to the Pope and to various western
princes.
The earliest known example of
such a correspondence is embedded in
a Latin report written by a Domini¬
can Friar called Julian in which he
described the information he had
gathered in eastern Europe about the
Mongols. The letter, addressed to
King Bêla IV of Hungary, had been
written by a Mongol ruler, proba¬
bly the Great Khan Güyük, some
time before Julian's return to Hun¬
gary in December 1237.
Only the Latin translation of
the letter has survived. According
to Julian: "The letter was written
in pagan characters but in the Tartar
[i.e. Mongol] tongue, so that the
king [of Hungary] found many
who could decipher it but none
who could understand it. But we, as
we crossed pagan Cumania, found
someone who interpreted it for us."
Of course the Hungarians them¬
selves used the Latin script, but they
had recently offered asylum to the
Cumans who spoke a Turkic lan-

Beijing.
guagc, and it has been surmised that
among them were people who rec¬
ognized the script: probably that of
the Turkic-speaking Uighurs. But
being able to read a script is in itself
not enough to understand its con¬
tent; for this purpose an individual
who was literate as well as knowing
Mongolian had to be found. The let¬
ter (see box on opposite page) reads
something like an ultimatum.
The laborious process of mul¬
tiple translations is well illustrated
in observations by the Franciscan
Friar John of Piano Carpini, who
was sent as an emissary to the Mon¬
gols by Pope Innocent IV in 1245.
When the Great Khan Güyük was
about to send a letter to the Pope,
Piano Carpini was asked whether
there were any people in the Pope's
entourage who could read Russian,
Persian or Mongol. The Friar sug¬
gested that the best plan would be
for the Mongols to write in Mon
gol and to have the text translated,
there and then, word for word, into
Latin. The accuracy of this Latin
translation was then carefully
checked and the letter was taken to
Rome, where, in the course of time,
it was lost. Fortunately, a copy of
the text is incorporated in the
chronicle of Carpini's contempo¬
rary, the monk Salimbcnc. The
notaries and scribes working in the
Great Khan's court thought it wise,
for variety's sake, to prepare a Per¬
sian translation of the Mongol text.
It was discovered in 1920 in the
papal archives, and provides us with
a splendid example of the multilin¬
gual nature of the Mongol chancery.
The letter has a preamble, writ¬
ten in Uighur, clearly the adminis¬
trative language if not of the Mon¬
gol court, at least of the Uighur
scribes who manned it. This pre¬
amble was probably the standard
formula with which letters by the
Great Khans began. It reads: "By
the strength of Eternal Heaven,
powerful ruler of the great coun¬
try and of the sea: our command¬
ment." The preamble is followed
by a red seal written in Mongol (in
Uighur script) with a similarly
worded injunction.
Guy iik's letter was meant as an
answer to one written by Pope
Innocent IV and transmitted by
Carpini himself. It constitutes an
ultimatum to the Pope and other
princes of the West who arc
enjoined to appear in person in the
Mongol court, to pay homage to
the Great Khan and to listen to his
orders. Were they to disobey these
orders, the Great Khan would view
them as enemies. Güyük also cate¬
gorically rejects the Pope's repri¬
mands for Mongol atrocities com¬
mitted in Hungary and elsewhere.
Such acts, writes the Khan, were
committed in retaliation against

because they had murdered Mon¬
gol ambassadors. He explains and
defends his past actions with the
following reasoning. "From where
the sun rises to where it goes down,
all the lands belong to us. Were it
not for the will of God, how could
that have happened?"
In stark contrast with the tone
and content of this letter is that writ¬
ten in Mongol and sent in 1305 by
the Mongol il-khan of Persia Olj eitü
to Philip IV the Fair, king of France.
By that time old feuds were forgot¬
ten, and the hope of an alliance
against the Egyptian Mameluks
seemed desirable to both parties. The
letter had two aims: to inform the
king of France that the fratricidal
struggle between the descendants of
Chinggis khan had been satisfacto¬
rily settled and that the il-khan was
ready to follow the friendly poli¬
cies towards France initiated by his
ancestors.
The likelihood of anyone's
being able to read a Mongol letter in
the French court was dim indeed,
and Oljeitü acted wisely by choos¬
ing as one of the bearers of his mes¬
sage a man who probably spoke
Mongol as well as French. This was
the Italian Thomas Ugi of Siena and
it may be assumed that it was he
who, on the back of the letter,
penned an Italian paraphrase of its
content. (See box this page.)
Letter from Oljeitii, Mongol il-Khan of Persia,
to Philip the Fair of France
"Our words. The ruler Oljeitii.
"To the ruler of France.
"How could it have escaped your attention that since ancient times the kings of France
had friendly relations with our good great-grandfather, our good grandfather, our good
father and our good elder brother? Although far away, you considered them near by and you
sent them messages whether or not favourable, and you exchanged ambassadors and gifts
of good will. At present when, by the grace of Heaven, I have occupied the great throne of
the il-khans, I would not act contrary to the precepts and rules established by my good
ancestors, norwould I depart from what had been agreed between you and them.
Considering it sacred, I would not abandon what had been agreed upon. More than ever, it
is myintention to be finked with you in friendship and to exchange ambassadors with you.
"As a result of calumnious utterances made by evil people we, elder and younger
brothers, allowed our mutual affection to wane. But now, all of us, descendants of
Chinggis khan, who for forty-five years had remonstrated against each other, have now '
reached an agreement. From the country of the Chinese where the sun rises, to the other
end of the world, our nations are linked by postal stations. We agreed that we would act
jointly against our enemies.
"We thought: how could we abandon the good relations that had existed between
our good forebears and you? So we sent to you ourtwo ambassadors, Mamalagh and
Thomas.
"It has come to our knowledge that you, kings of the West, also live in peace.
Verily, what is better than concord? As for those who would be hostile to either us or you,
with the help of Heaven, we would act jointly against them.
"We wrote this letter in the year 704 of the Snake (=1305 A.D.) in the first month
of the summer, at the city of Aliwan."
LONG-DISTANCE MAIL
Among the very few private letters
that have been preserved, pride of
place is taken by the so-called
"Ancient Letters" written in Sog-
dian, an east Iranian language no
longer in use. These writings were
discovered in 1907 by the explorer
Sir Aurel Stein in a ruined watch-
tower located between Lou-Ian and
Tun-huang on the trade route from
the West to China. These letters,
commercial writings penned by
Sogdian merchants to their princi¬
pals, were probably lost or aban¬
doned while being carried from cast
to west. Their exact date cannot be
established but it seems certain that
they were written not later than the
early fourth century A.D.
One of them is particularly inter¬
esting, and because of its historical
references and its moving, one might
say, tragic content, it stands alone in
the corpus of medieval Inner Asian
letters. Written by a certain Nanai-
vandak, a Sogdian merchant living at
the eastern end of the great trade
route, it was addressed to his princi¬
pal in Samarkand, some 3,200 kilo¬
metres away.
"Sir," writes Nanai-vandak, "if I
wrote you all the details of how
China fared, it would be a story of
debts and woe	 And, Sir, the last
emperor [of China] so they say
fled from Saragh [his capital city]
because of the famine. And his for¬
tified residence and fortified town
were set on fire. The residence burnt
down and the town was destroyed.
So Saragh is no more!"

### Interview with Mstislav Rostropovich
interview Mstislav Rostropovich
To celebrate his seventieth
birthday, in May 1997
Mstislav Rostropovich, the
great Russian cellist and
conductor, invited his
musician friends from all
overthe world to join him
atthe Rencontres
Musicales (Musical
Encounters) at Evian in
France. Among those who
attended were the St.
Petersburg Symphony
Orchestra, Isaac Stern,
Jean-Pierre Rampai, Itzhak
Perlman, the Orchestra of
the Nations and the Ballet
of Lithuania. Isabelle
Leymarie interviewed
Rostropovich during the
celebrations.
Are your exuberance, your enthusiasm and your
generosity innate or have you developed them over
the years?
Mstislav Rostropovich: Innate. I was born happy!
H How did your love for the cello originate?
M. R.: Little by little. At the age of four I began
to learn to play the piano, then three years later
my father said to me: "You are going to play the
cello." My father was a cellist himself so he prob¬
ably wanted me to perpetuate the tradition, lie
realized that 1 was very gifted musically. I was
already composing at the age of four.
Do you still compose?
M.R.:No.
Is it difficult to play both the cello and the
piano?
M. R.: I don't play the piano any more. My wife
won't let inc.
Why?
M. R.: I accompanied her on the piano for thirty-
five years. When she stopped singing, other
famous singers asked me to accompany them,
liut my wife put her foot down. "You're already
lucky that I allow you to conduct orchestras!"
Russian women are very forceful!
M. R.: Oh yes, very powerful. Very powerful. [Sal¬
vador] Dali's wife Gala, a Russian, had a very
forceful character just like my wife in fact.
They were friends and got along very well. I
remember one day my Calina said to Gala: "That
blessed moustache oí your husband's! Why don't
you cut it off while he's asleep':" Gala replied:
"Because he'd drop dead when he woke up and
saw it gone!"
Do you enjoy conducting an orchestra as much as
playing?
M. R.: Yes, the happiness and joy are just as
intense. Perhaps even more extraordinary
because the music 1 conduct is better than what
I play myself.

7 regard my interpretation of a work as a
kind of improvisation. I put myself in the
composer's place.9
And yet you do not have the same physical,
sensual contact with an instrument.
M. R.: That's true, but when I conduct sym¬
phonies by Beethoven, Mahler or Shostakovich,
I'm in heaven.
Do an ear for music and musical tastes become
more refined over the years?
M. R.: Yes. Musical tastes develop, but gradually
and imperceptibly. I recently heard a recording
of the Dvorak concerto that I made as a young
man. Today I don't like it.
H How do you approach a new musical work?
M. R.: First (pf all by reading through the score
without an instrument. I bear all the music in
my head, the phrasing, the nuances, all the
details. Of course, when I pick up my cello,
changes may occur, but 1 always have a clear
idea in my head of what I'm going to do.
Improvisation has practically disappeared from
the classical repertory. Do you miss creating your
own music?
M. R.: Don't forget that interpretation to some
extent invol\ es improvisation.
And yet when Chopin or Liszt sat down at the
piano they created impromptu music at the drop of a
hat.
M. R.: Hut they were composers of genius! In their
day there were also pianists who were incapable
of improvising even on two notes. 1 regard my
interpretation of a work as a kind of improvisa¬
tion. It's as though I myself were composing it.
I put myself in the composer's place.
So we're talking about a re-creation.
M.R.: Exactly.
What qualities are needed to play well?
M. R.: First of all a tremendous love of music.
This is the only thing that can overcome the pre¬
concert emotional stress, the nerves, the stage
fright. If you don't love music, you feel naked on
the stage and just want to run away.
Despite your love of music, have you ever
suffered from stage fright?

been able to practise beforehand. I was terribly
uncomfortable. Sitting there at the keyboard I
thought: "There are lots of critics out there in
the audience, waiting to pounce like a pack of
wolves. They'd just love to chew me up and spit
me out." I made mistakes right from the start
and played the first two love songs terribly badly.
Then I thought: "What the heck! I've already
made some terrible mistakes, they can tear me to
pieces if they want to, so now I might as well
play for my own pleasure." Then I started to
play really well.
In any case, you don't make musicforthe critics,
many of whom aren't musicians anyway! You play for
the love of it, because it responds to an inner need.
M. R.: That was the problem; I had been dis¬
tracted. If you think of something else instead of
concentrating fully on the music, you won't play
well. That's what I was driving at. I forgot the

You are going to close these Musical Encounters
in Evian by playing Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet
with the Ballet of Lithuania and the Orchestra of the
Nations, which you will also conduct. What made you
choose this work?
M. R.: When I was a student at the Moscow Con¬
servatory, I attended all the performances of
Romeo and Juliet at the Bolshoi. I knew how to
play all the music on the piano, from beginning
to end. It's wonderful music, an absolutely fan¬
tastic ballet. I have dreamt of conducting it for
years. But to do that I needed special choreog¬
raphy. 1 didn't want the dancers dictating the
tempo to me with their feet. 1 wanted there to be
a real give-and-take and I also wanted to set the
rhythm. So Vladimir Wassiliev, who started at
the Bolshoi, produced a new choreography spe¬
cially forme.
It's exciting because; the; sccnography is
highly inventive: the orchestra is eni stage, ne>t in
the pit, anel se> the; music itself is the; heart of all
the action. The; orchestra is placed se> that I can
conduct it while facing the audience. In front
of the orchestra is a stage; epn which all the street
activities go em. Above the orchestra is a kind epf
bridge em which Juliet's bedroom is placed, anel
e»n which all the inside scenes are; set. It's an
excellent idea.
In Wassiliev's latest ¡production it's impossi¬
ble to restrain one's tears. When Juliet is elying,
she bedels e>ut her hands tet Bepmeo, who is already
dead, without being able te) touch hi in. When the
orchestra j)lays the last chord, I slowly go elown
to them and join their hands. It's wonderful!
Wonderful! When I conduct the; scene with Friar
Laurence, when the twep young lovers ge) te) the
church, the music is in four-lour time. And se) I
make; the; arm movement lor 4/4 time, from left
to right anel from up te> down, identical to the; sign
e>f the cross. Romeo anel Juliet come to me as if
I were a priest, and I appear te> be; blessing them.
So you become Rostro-pope-vich!
M. R.: The; pre>eluctie>n is full of original ideas and
the score is admirable.
In spite of your cosmopolitan existence, do you
have a special affection for Russian music?
M. R.: Yes, of course. Above all for Shostakovich
because he was my great friend. I j)lay his music
with intense feeling.
Is the musical scene in Russia still as lively as
ever?
M. R.: Yes, very much se). Thine are many young
composers. There are; oidor e>ne;s too, who are;
still relatively unknown, which is a pity because
they are; great musicians.
Do you intend to record their works?
M. R.: Yes, I've been thinking about it for a long
time. For example, there; is a woman named Sofia

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
DIVERSITY AND COMPLEXITY
I am seventeen years old and have been a Courier
subscriber for a year. I like the articles very
muchespecially since they often coincide with
my own ideas. In a world full of cruelty and
hypocrisy, your magazine shows us that all is not
lost.
I know that this century's most important
themes are diversity and complexity. I feel great
respect for all the world's cultures, and I enjoy
discovering their best features. In this respect I
think I am very lucky since I live between two cul¬
tures: my parents were born in the Republic of
Korea and I was born in Argentina. I have assim¬
ilated my parents' culture and that of my coun¬
try. Your October 1996 issue ("Exiles") helped
me understand that there are ether people who
live and feel as I do. On this subject, as on so many
others, the Courier is a companion that is help¬
ing me to grow up.

NEW PRIORITIES FOR PEACE
Your magazine contains much thought-provoking
reading, and I was particularly interested by Fed¬
erico Mayor's article in the November 1995 issue
("Peace, a new beginning").
Peace, which once depended on two empires,
seems to have become everyody's business since
the fall of communism in the former Soviet Union.
In order to preserve it, we may need to define a
new order of priorities and show new vigilance. In
short, prevention and not cure should be the order
of the day; we should cultivate the idea of peace
within us.
The idea of peace is on the agenda and is
making its way in people's minds. So much the
better. But what can be done to combat the indi¬
vidualism and egocentricity of Western societies?
What can be done to encourage a new spirit of
sharing and fulfil this promise of peace?

A CALL
FOR DISARMAMENT
We have read a mass of documents produced by
Unesco and other United Nations bodies. These
studies and reports are the outcome of enormous
effort and put forward some magnificent ideas.
After discussing them in depth, however, we
started to have some doubts. All these fine words,
spoken and written, have had no effect. The same
problems are still with us, and new ones have
even been added.
We have reached the following conclusion:
While diplomats work to maintain or restore
peace, the arms industries are flourishing and
delivering weapons to those who will one day
ignite conflicts and massacre populations. The
danger is now ubiquitous because international
gangsters can get their hands on highly sophisti¬
cated and destructive weapons.
THERE ARE TOO MANY UNSCRUPULOUS,
COWARDLY AND GREEDY COUNTRIES. TO SALVE
THEIR CONSCIENCE, THEY ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES
WITH CULTURAL AND HUMANITARIAN GOALS AND
CREATE ORGANIZATIONS TO ACHIEVE THESE
GOALS.
Nevertheless we still believe in the ideals
defended by Unesco. In order to make a modest
contribution to specific action to promote disar¬
mament and a thorough overhaul of our way of
life, we have written a six-page document ¡n which
we set forth our ideas and proposals in the
plainest possible terms. We offer it to anyone who
may be interested.

NO PLACE FOR COLONIAL LANGUAGE
The May 1997 issue of the Unesco Courier, ("Land¬
scape with figures, the dialogue between people
and places") is beautifully illustrated, and I espe¬
cially enjoyed France Bequette's article, "Gar¬
dens of the Far East". But "Far East" in the title?
This reminds me of the old saw, "Far from where,
and East of what?" Colonial language has no place
in the atlas of the year 2000. 1 think that "East
Asia" is the proper term.

READERS TO THE RESCUE
The cover of the November 1996 issue ("The mar¬
ket place, past and present") shows a painting
entitled Market Scene in Mexico (1987). You
invited readers to try to decipher the signature
on the painting. It seems to me that what is writ¬
ten in the lower right-hand corner is "Nicolás de
Jesús 87". The name has a strong autochthonous
flavour, like the subject of the painting, which I
think is magnificent ¡n its composition, its light
and its movement.
I have been a devoted reader of the Courier
since 1976, and always find in it subjects for
thought and discussion. For me and my friends
and students, it is a source of information about
ways of life all over the world.

I believe that the name of the painter of Market
Scene in Mexico is clearly "Nicolás de Jesús".
I should like to take this opportunity to con¬
gratulate you on the excellent quality of your mag¬
azine.
