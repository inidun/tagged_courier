Women in the majority of countries still
face discrimination in most branches of
higher education. This is revealed by a
recent Unesco study on international
trends in higher education, some of
whose findings are published in this
issue devoted to International Women's
Year (see pages 11 and 18). Our photo
shows detail of a vast mural in the
"House of Arts" of the University of
Concepción, Chile. Entitled "Presence
of Latin America", it is by the Mexican
painter Jorge Gonzalez Camarena.
Layout and design for this issue have
been specially executed by a young
French woman graphic artist. Claude
Verne, of Paris.

WOMEN'S LIB
30 years of progress

### EDITORIAL

The United Nations has proclaimed
1975 International Women's
Year in order to promote new
efforts throughout the world in
the struggle to end discrimination
against women. This issue of the
"Unesco Courier" is entirely
devoted to this problem. It opens
with the article below by Mrs.
Helvi Sipilä, Assistant Secretary-
General for Social Development
and Humanitarian Affairs at the
United Nations and Secretary-
General for International
Women's Year. Mrs. Sipilä,
the highest-ranking woman
staff member of the U.N.
Secretariat, reviews the progress
accomplished in the last 30 years
but also points out what still
needs to be done before women can
fully participate in social,
political, economic and cultural
life in every country
on completely equal terms with men.
The "Unesco Courier" intends
to devote its August-September
1 975 double issue to other aspects
of this question.

G
-~J INCE the U.N. began in 1945
^^ a great deal has been done to
improve the situation and status of
women in the world. Particularly in
the legal field, much has been and is
being done to accord women equal
rights with men in political, economic,
social and family life. Age-old trad¬
itions, attitudes and practices are
still, however, slow to change and the
gap between law and reality still
remains very wide.
In the political field, for example,
HELVI L. SIPILA, of
Finland, is in addition
to her functions at the
United Nations indicat¬
ed above, Secretary-
General of the United
Nations Conference for
International Women's
Year which will be
held in Mexico City
between June 19 and
July 4, 1975. A lawyer,
Mrs. Sipilä has played
a leading part in the work of Finnish govern¬
ment committees dealing with matrimonial
legislation and the protection of children. She
was President of the International Federation
of Women Lawyers (1954-56), Chairman
of the U.N. Commission on the Status of
Women (1967), and since 1970 she has been
Vice-President of the International Council
of Women.

^. whereas in 1945 women were denied
the right to vote in approximately one
third of the U.N.'s 51 Member States,
today women are legally eligible to
vote in all elections and to stand for
election on equal terms with men in
124 Member Nations. Yet, the per¬
centage of women holding policy¬
making posts in the local, national and
international areas still remains strik¬
ingly small.
In New Zealand, for example, which
was the first nation in the world to
grant women the vote in 1893, 92 per
cent of the candidates and 95 per cent
of those elected in the last elections
(1972) were men. In Egypt, in 1967,
76 per cent of women failed to vote.
The highest percentages of political
participation in national legislatures
are reported in the U.S.S.R. (35 per
cent) and Finland (21.5 per cent).
At the international level, the picture
is equally dismal. In the 28th U.N.
General Assembly (1973), for example,
there were only 180 women compared
to 2,369 men delegates. There were
no women in the delegations of
55 countries and only one woman in
the delegations of 44 countries.
In the economic field, considerable
progress has been made in the past
25 years. In 1945 women's right to
work and to equal conditions of work
(including the thorny question of equal
pay for work of equal value) was hard¬
ly discussed, even in the International
Labour Organization. Today, these
questions are fully accepted as
"rights" to be recognized and im¬
plemented in practice, albeit progress¬
ively and at a very slow pace.
A number of ILO instruments,
especially the 1951 Convention on
Equal Remuneration for Men and
Women Workers for work of equal
value and the 1958 Convention on
discrimination in employment and
occupation have been landmarks in
this process of achieving public
acceptance of these rights.
Nevertheless women, who constitute
about 562 million workers or 34 per
cent of the world's labour force (38 per
cent for the developed, 32 per cent
for developing countries) are mainly
concentrated in a limited number of
jobs, frequently at low levels of skills
and responsibilities with equally low
wages or salaries.
Their work is often not recognized
in practice as being of equal value to
men's work and their pay for the same
job is often lower. And these figures
do not take into account the millions
of women who are toiling from morn¬
ing till night as unpaid subsistence
farm or domestic workers. There are
no statistics to tell us how many
women live in such circumstances, nor
the extent of their economic output
and return.
Statistical data on wage differentials
of men and women in the various
sectors and occupations are very in¬
adequate, but ILO studies suggest that
even in many industrialized countries

Women's Year.

Associates, New York.
women's wages are about 50 to 80 per
cent of men's for the same work time..
The concentration of women in
lower ranking positions is found even
in the United Nations Secretariat,
where approximately 80 per cent of the
General Service staff, but only 20 per
cent of professional staff, are women.
As regards education, while few
today would deny women's right to be
educated equally with men, women
remain in many countries seriously
disadvantaged at every level primary,
secondary and at the higher level.
Particularly in the developed world,
some progress has been made through
educational measures to eliminate
prejudice and discriminatory attitudes
based on the stereotyping of sex roles.
Changes have included curriculum
reform, greater flexibility in the choice
of subjects for both boys and girls
(both, for example, are now studying
the same amount of mathematics,
sciences and home economics in
some countries) and both are being
educated in sex and family life.
Whatever illiteracy prevails, how¬
ever, the percentage of illiterate
females is always higher than that of
males. In 1960 the illiteracy rates
were 33.5 per cent for men and
44.9 per cent for women. By 1970
these were 28.0 per cent and 40.3 per
cent, respectively. In Africa and the
Arab States which have the highest
rates, the female illiteracy rate drop¬
ped from 88.5 to 83.7 per cent and
from 90.7 to 85.7 per cent, respectively,
in the same decade.
Despite the fact that special efforts
have been made in many countries to
provide adult literacy classes, a much
lower ratio of women than men
continue to enroll. This is due mainly
to such factors as distance from
schools, impracticability of travelling
by night, household chores, early
marriage, outmoded attitudes and
sheer lack of adequate facilities to ser¬
vice the number of illiterate persons.
Access to education of girls and
women in different parts of the world
also depends on the level of general
development of a country. But even
in industrialized countries, where
primary education is compulsory,
differences in curricula, in teaching
methods and in subjects available to
girls and boys continue to exist. One
of the results is the preponderance of
women in the labour force in certain
fields and their small or complete lack
of representation in other fields.
The element of choice may be
theoretically present but to a large
extent the "choice" is induced by sex-
biased education which begins in early
childhood. Clearly differential treat¬
ment exists equally with regard to
vocational training and this leads to
different opportunities in employment
and occupations, different salaries,
wages and occupational hierarchies,
no matter what principles of equality
exist in law.
The trend towards the improvement
of the legal position of women has
accelerated markedly in recent years,
and the principle of equal rights of
men and women has now been rec¬
ognized and written into the basic
laws of many countries. While, in
some instances, formal legal equality
has existed since the early part of this
century (e.g. Nordic and Eastern
European countries), in most cases
major changes have taken place only
since 1945.
In the field of civil law, however, and
especially family law, the principle of
equality has not yet won universal
acceptance although there have been
noticeable trends in that direction in
recent years. Recent or current re¬
forms have done away with legisla¬
tion which was discriminatory against
women and several countries have
enacted laws with the aim of achieving
a more equitable sharing of rights and
responsibilities within the family.

### 49654: Women's lib: 30 years of progress

Laws enacted in some countries
(e.g. Brazil, France, the Ivory Coast,
Luxembourg, Monaco) in the past two
decades reveal, for example, discern¬
ible trends toward a more even-
handed partnership of the spouses in
decision-making; towards a more
equitable sharing, based on the earn¬
ing ability of each, of the assets
acquired during marriage at the time
the marriage is dissolved (e.g. Austria,
Canada [various provinces], France,
Monaco); towards the recognition of
the work of the housewife as a contri¬
bution to the assets of the family,
assets which should be shared by the
spouses (or their heirs) at the disso¬
lution of marriage (e.g. Eastern Euro¬
pean countries, and in the United
Kingdom [since 1970]).
Some countries, which had not
previously done so, adopted legisla¬
tion recognizing the inheritance rights
of the surviving spouse (e.g. France),
and equal parental rights and duties,
the interest of the child being the para¬
mount consideration. The latter
included the granting of full status as
a parent to the unmarried mother (e.g.
Austria, Sweden).
The laws of various countries gov¬
erning divorce have been liberalized
to some extent. Divorce is now per¬
mitted in countries where previously
it was not recognized, e.g. Italy (since
1974), Monaco (since 1970). In Afgha¬
nistan (since 1971) the wife now has
the legal right to divorce under certain
conditions, whereas formerly, it was
the exclusive privilege of the husband.
In other countries, divorce has been
made much easier for both spouses
than previously (e.g., Sweden, the
United States of America [State of
New York]).
In many countries, however, the
husband is still recognized in law as
the "head of the family" and plays the
dominant role in the marriage relation¬
ship, the wife being relegated to an
inferior position with little or no legal
say in decisions affecting herself and
other members of the family.
The laws of some of these countries
may stipulate that the wife owes
obedience to her husband (e.g. Ethio¬
pia, Jordan, Mali, Tunisia). She may
need the authorization of her husband
or the court to exercise her legal
capacity to contract, sue and be sued
(e.g. Ecuador, Haiti, Mexico, the Phi¬
lippines, Uruguay). Her property
rights may be limited under the rules
governing the property relations of the
spouses. Her right to work may be
subject to the express or implied
authorization of her husband (e.g.
Burundi, Ecuador [only to engage in
trade or industry], Mali [to engage in
trade]). In other countries, however,
the law requires that the wife owe
obedience to her husband.
Despite the fact that modern legis¬
lative trends increasingly recognize
the importance of women's employ¬
ment outside the home, from the view¬
point of overall economic development
as well as personal or family need.
the role of homemaker is still assigned
primarily to the woman, not only
through tradition and social custom
but also in some instances in law, and
she is expected to perform that role
without financial compensation during
marriage. This may be explicitly for¬
mulated in the law or implied in va¬
rious legal provisions concerning
maintenance of the wife and of the
family's expenses when these are the
main responsibility of the husband.
This problem is of major importance
in considering ways to increase
opportunities for women to participate
in gainful employment and develop¬
ment. Governments and government
planners in some countries have be¬
gun to realize that functions should be
more equitably divided between the
sexes so that both may have practical
opportunities to participate in parent¬
hood and in employment.
It is also being gradually recognized
that policies which attempt to give
women an equal place with men in
economic life, while at the same time
confirming women's traditional re¬
sponsibility for the care of the home
and children, have no prospect of
fulfilling the first of these aims.
There is one field in which equality
does not arise, but in which the needs
and rights of women obviously need
protection, and that is maternity. Be¬
cause of the lack of women's particip¬
ation in the formulation of policies in
the field of health, their special needs
for the protection of maternity are
often not even known to the decision¬
makers. This is, therefore, one of the
most neglected fields of health care
in many countries. Although the avail¬
ability of health services largely
depends on the resources and per¬
sonnel available, much could be
achieved by inexpensive training in
health, nutrition and home economics
as preventive health services.
In all our efforts to improve the
quality of life of all human beings, too
little attention is paid to the needs of
millions of children and mothers,
especially in the developing areas,
rural as well as urban. How can we
improve the quality of life of a human
being born to an illiterate, economical¬
ly dependent, malnourished, and over¬
burdened woman, whose health may
leave much to be desired and who
gives birth to one child per year?
International Women's Year 1975
gives all of us a unique opportunity
to focus attention on eliminating these
still pervasive discriminations against
women, thereby enabling women to
more fully participate and contribute
to the economic, social and political
life of our planet.
The significance of the Year will be
what we make of it. It could be a
truly historic year a landmark not
only in the history of women's ad¬
vancement but also in the advance¬
ment of humanity as a whole. Let us
all work to make it so.

The "Unesco Courier"

articles based on an
important world-wide
study carried out
by the International
Labour Office.
Entitled "Equality

this question at the
International Labour
Conference to be
held in Geneva in
June 1975.

WOMEN make up more
than a third of the wold's
economically active population and 46
out of every 100 women between 15
and 64 years of age are employed.
It is estimated that of the world's
1,637 million persons employed in
1975, about 562 million are women.
The female labour force in the more
developed regions some 187 million
in 1970 may be expected to increase
by some 20 million each decade and
to number about 254 million by the
year 2000. In the less developed
regions, the female labour force has
been estimated as reaching over
603 million in the year 2000.
The percentage of women in the
total labour force in the major areas
of the world varies considerably. The
lowest figure is found in Latin America
with about 20 per cent; Africa, South
Asia and Oceania have about 30 per
cent, while in Europe and Northern
America about 35 per cent of all
persons in the labour force are wo¬
men; East Asia has a rather high per¬
centage (about 39), while the U.S.S.R.
has the extremely high level of around
51 women for every 100 persons in
its labour force.
The available statistics indicate,
however, that in certain areas women
make up less than 12 per cent of the
total percentage of persons at work
(North Africa, Middle America [main¬
land], tropical South America, Poly¬
nesia and Micronesia), and in others
between 12 and 21 per cent (Southern
Africa, the Caribbean, temperate South
America, Middle South Asia, South
East Asia and Southern Europe).
10
In the United States women made
up 38 per cent of the total workforce
in 1972 as against 30 per cent in 1950.
In Canada the number of working
women rose from 27 per cent of the
total labour force in 1962 to over 33
per cent in 1972. Australia and New
Zealand have also both registered
considerable increases in women's
employment.
In Japan there has been a dramatic
rise in women's employment. In 1972
women workers represented 38 per
cent of the entire labour force and
48 per cent of the female population
of 15 years of age and over.
In Eastern Europe women continue
to play a highly important role in
economic life. In Hungary women con¬
stituted 42 per cent of the workforce
in 1971 (as against 38 per cent in
1963); in Czechoslovakia 47 per cent
in 1969 (as against 43 per cent in
1955); in Poland 40 per cent of the
labour force in 1972; and in Bulgaria,
at the end of 1971, women in employ¬
ment comprised 46 per cent of the
total active population. In Romania
and the German Democratic Republic
they represent nearly 50 per cent.
In the less developed countries the
great bulk of the female labour force
is still in agriculture (e.g. over 90 per
cent in some countries in Africa). In
most of the industrialized countries
the percentage of women in agricul¬
ture is low (under 10 per cent in many
cases and between 1 and 2 per cent
in the United Kingdom and the United
States).
With some exceptions (e.g. Asia),
women form a large part of the total

A high proportion of Asia's medical

Japan in 1970, 81 per cent in the Phi¬

Europe (76 per cent in Poland and
56 percent in Hungary and the U.S.S.R.).
In Africa, though facilities for medical
studies are still limited, the number of
women students of medicine is fairly
high in comparison with other subjects.

quadrupling in Indonesia (from 9 to

^ labour force in the professional and
technical category, in some cases
actually outnumbering men (largely
because of the predominance of
women in educational and health
services). They comprise only a small
proportion of administrative, executive
and managerial workers. On the
other hand, they make up a large part
of the clerical workforce in many
countries, particularly in the more
developed ones, and form a high
proportion of the sales force in some
countries. In most countries they are
only thinly represented in the ranks of
craftsmen, production workers and
labourers.
In most countries women continue
to be concentrated in a limited number
of occupations in most instances at
relatively low levels of skill and
responsibility.
In this connexion it should be
pointed out that there is a clear
correlation between the education and
training of women and their partici¬
pation in economic activity. The
general rule appears to be that the
higher the levels of education the
greater the woman's commitment to
work, whether with or without short

is also low, except in Indonesia (32 per

interruptions for childbearing and
rearing. There is no such direct link
between the level of education and
the economic activity of men.
Another factor which influences
women's participation in economic life
far more than men's is the number and
age of their children. As long as in
most countries it continues to be
assumed that the mother bears the
principal responsibility for the care of
young children, and as long as the
social infrastructure in respect of child
care remains inadequate for the
demands made upon it, the presence
of preschool and primary-school
children will tend to have a limiting
effect on the labour force participation
of married women.
The increase in the number and
proportion of employed married
women has been accompanied by an
increase in the number and proportion
of working mothers.
In the United States, between 1940
and 1972, the number of working
mothers increased more than eight¬
fold. It is estimated that in Canada
1 million children have mothers who

ing mothers with small children is
constantly increasing. In the Federal
Republic of Germany, more than a
quarter of the economically active
women have at least 1 child under
15 years of age.
In France, in 1968, among mothers
aged under 35, 51 per cent of those
with 1 child were at work. In Austria
the 1969 micro-census showed that
46 per cent of mothers with children
under 15 were working.
In the U.S.S.R. and Eastern Europe
a very high proportion of the women in
employment have dependent children.
In Poland about half of all women
workers had children under 16 years
of age in 1973.
Part-time employment has also con¬
tinued to increase. Although part-time
employment is not for women only,
the bulk of the part-time labour force
is made up of women. In some
countries the number of women
employed on a part-time basis is
considerable.
Some economists have advanced a
theory on a three-phase life for
women: the initial period of work com
ing before marriage and up to the birth
of the first or second child; the second
phase comprising withdrawal from
employment until the last child has
grown up; and the third phase being
the return to employment until the
normal age of retirement. This theory
has been contested on the basis of
facts brought out in recent studies of
the pattern of women's work and home
life in a number of countries.
In some of the more developed
western countries there is evidence of
a trend towards a continuous working
career as against the three-phase life-
work cycle; this sometimes takes the
form of full-time employment, with
sometimes some years on a part-time
basis, but there is a continuity of work.
There is also evidence that women's
commitment to work varies with the
level of education. In the socialist
countries the educational and social
system and policy presuppose an
almost continuous working career on
the part of the vast majority of women.
On the other hand, non-participation
after marriage remains a common
pattern among married women in some
of these countries, at least until the
children have grown up.
In many developing countries
women whether by necessity or by
choicetend to remain at work and
the cycle of their work life is largely
continuous. This may be traced partly
to family poverty, partly to the high
rate of women's participation in agri¬
culture and partly to other factors,
including the tradition of working hard
(as in Asia and Africa) and their
primary responsibility for family main¬
tenance.

the percentage of women education

other disciplines. In Latin America,
the figures are 87 per cent for Argen¬
tina and 77 per cent for Brazil, but the
percentage of women education stu¬
dents in the continent dropped slightly
between 1960 and 1970. In Africa the
proportion of women studying educa¬
tion is higher than in other fields.

### 49658: Myths that die hard


2. Myths that die hard
HISTORICAL and political factors
have proved to be of critical
importance in changing the status of
women, in particular in countries
which have achieved independence
or undergone a national revolution or
a complete change of political,
economic and social structures. Econ¬
omic factors are also of basic import¬
ance in determining the extent of the
employment opportunities available to
women.
Experience has shown how difficult
it is, at a time of chronic and growing
unemployment and underemployment,
to ensure women's right to work on
a footing of equality with men. In
most cases women workers are seen
as a threat to men, as intruders in a
male domain. And even in many
developed countries women's right to
work is dependent on the buoyancy
of the economy. In periods of econ¬
omic recession it is easy to see how
fragile is their right to equality of
opportunity and treatment.
Almost everywhere there remains
a clear division of labour by sex with
jobs labelled as "men's work" and
"women's work". While the line of
demarcation may vary with time and
place, what is significant is the per¬
sistence of distinctions based on sex
stereotypes.

JURIST
Above, a judge in a French court. In 1967
less than one French law student in
three was a woman, and in the world's
law schools as a whole the number of
women students is still low. For exam¬
ple, in seven Latin American countries.
(Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Guya¬
na, Mexico, Panama and Peru) women
comprise less than 20 per cent of law
students. In Cuba and Uruguay, how¬
ever, there are almost as many women
studying law as men.
As has often been emphasized, job
labelling of this kind is both dangerous
and discriminatory. It leads to recruit¬
ment based on sex rather than on
capacity, and it perpetuates unproven
beliefs about women's abilities and
inabilities as workers. It places unjust
barriers in the way of opportunities for
advancement.
It creates a situation in which work
traditionally done by men commands
higher pay and prestige while that
traditionally done by women is ac¬
corded lower pay and prestige and is
consistently undervalued. It has no
inherent logic.
The fact that in most countries girls
and women are still to be found
preparing for typically "feminine"
occupations has caused considerable
concern in countries which have been
trying to overcome the division of the
employment market into "women's
work" and "men's work".
It is interesting that the budget
proposals of the Swedish National
Labour Market Board for the financial
year 1974/1975 contained two pro¬
posals aimed at breaking down sex-
linked occupational choice and re¬
cruitment practices.
The Board proposed that a training
grant of 5 Swedish crowns per hour
(approximately $1.00) should be paid
for a maximum period of 6 months,
to employers who train men for
"women's" jobs and vice versa.
This would be for an experimental
period of three years. It also proposed
that, on a two-year experimental basis,
employment subsidies of the same
amount for jobs created under regio¬
nal development schemes should be
conditional upon at least 40 per cent
of the new jobs going to each sex.
These proposals have been approved
by the Swedish Parliament.
In the United Kingdom, the Trades
Union Congress has urged that special
grants be made to firms which train
girls and women for jobs outside the
traditional range of women's work
(especially at technician level).

### 49658: Myths that die hard


Equal pay for Equal Work. One of
the most blatant forms of discrimina-
ion against women continues to be
unequal payment for work of equal
value. Acceptance of the principle of
equal pay means that minimum wages
must be the same for men and women,
that in the public sector the same sa¬
lary scale must apply to men and wom¬
en without discrimination and that in
the private sector action towards equal
pay, for example by the revision of
collective agreements, must be stimu¬
lated and supported.
The general picture and the trends
are encouraging. But there are still
many practical difficulties to be over¬
come. In many countries employers
are reluctant to apply the principle
fairly even when they accept it, and
reveal a tendency to evade equal pay
by a variety of practices and by
reference to "economic factors" or
the need for "technological inno¬
vation".
Why is it that so often when women
enter an occupation in any large
numbers wages fall or fail to rise?
Why is it that wages are traditionally
low in so-called women's occupa¬
tions? It would appear that in male-
dominated societies women's work is
apt, without reason, to be regarded as
of less value than that of men.
However important it may be to
achieve equal pay for equal work, this
is only one aspect of the broader
question of women's wages. Their
chief characteristic almost everywhere
is their low level as compared with
those of men.
While failure to apply the principle
of equal pay fully and fairly may be
an element in this situation, it is not
the only factor: others include the
heavy concentration of women in bad¬
ly paid industries and occupations,
their often lower level of education,
training and work experience, the han¬
dicaps imposed on them by society as
a result of their responsibilities, and
outright discrimination in employment.
Moreover, women tend to work
shorter hours than men and fewer
bonus hours (e.g. at night or on
Sundays or holidays). And where
wages are determined with regard to
length of service, women's generally
lower seniority may be an additional
factor. ILO studies of the position in
industrialized countries suggest that
women's wages are about 50 to 80 per
cent of men's for the same work time.
Can differences in women's wages
be justified by differences in their
work performance? Are women "re¬
liable" workers?
These questions are often asked
and all too often left unanswered, leav¬
ing the inference that there is little
doubt that women are less steady
workers than men.
A number of myths about women as
workers are crumbling under the
pressure of facts.
Women are often accused of exces¬
sive absenteeism or of having a high
rate of turnover. In the United States,
a Public Health Service survey of
work time lost due to illness or injury
in 1967 showed that women lost on the

Sweden. In Japan on the other hand,

average 5.6 days as compared to 5.3
days for men. A number of European
surveys have come to the same gen¬
eral conclusions.
Analyses indicate that the skill level
of the job, the marital status and age
of the workers, length of service and
record of job stability provide better
clues to differences in job perform¬
ance than does the fact that the work¬
er is a man or a woman.
For Women Only. In many countries
industrial and social history has left
a heritage of protective legislation
applying to women only. This legis¬
lation, however well intended, has
sometimes led to discrimination
against them as workers. The prohibi¬
tion of underground work for women is
the most common form of protective
legislation applying to women only.
Most countries also specify a series
of other occupations from which
women are barred on the grounds that
the work is dangerous or unhealthy
for them. In many cases physical
strength was a primary factor in the
prohibitions and restrictions; in other
cases health protection from the
standpoint of women's role as a mo¬
ther was a leading factor. In still other
cases, there appears to have been a
notion of protecting women from work
regarded as "unpleasant" and "un¬
suitable for women". The general
trend today seems to be to attack the
hazards as hazards for all workers
and to improve the standards of pro¬
tection for men as well as women.
On the other hand where women,
because of their biological function of
reproduction, do incur proven special
health risks as new techniques and
substances are introduced, they do
require and should receive special
protection and this should not be
regarded as discriminatory or in
conflict with the principle of equality
of opportunity and treatment. There
will always remain a limited sphere in
which women will need protection:
that of maternity.
Maternity protection. Maternity pro¬
tection is a most important matter for
working mothers and for society as
a whole. Greater responsibility for
maternity protection is being assumed
by the State, on the grounds that
maternity is a clearly recognized so¬
cial function.
Considerable progress towards mat¬
ernity protection has been made
during the last decade. The ILO
standards on this subject have con¬
tinued to provide the framework for
national action. Today, few countries
lack some system of maternity pro¬
tection for women workers.
Nevertheless, even if the essentials
of maternity protection are now being
extended almost everywhere, women
workers still have many practical
problems connected with pregnancy,
childbirth and the care of infants.
One of the more interesting recent
developments in maternity protection
has been the extension of the period
of authorized maternity leave beyond
the normal statutory or prescribed
period, without loss of employment
rights.
This extension of leave is now
common practice in the socialist
countries of Eastern Europe. For
example, in Bulgaria a working mo¬
ther, following obligatory paid leave,

may take further leave for between 8
and 12 months at a minimum basic
wage and still further unpaid leave
with employment rights protected until
the child is 3 years old.
In Poland a mother may take leave
until her child is 3 years old, with
guarantee of re-employment and re¬
lated benefits. In Hungary, after
5 months' maternity leave with full pay,
a working mother may choose to
remain at home until her child is
3 years old and during this period,
which is counted as a period of
employment for retirement purposes,
she receives a monthly mother's
allowance and the guarantee of
returning to her former job. In the
German Democratic Republic, a mo¬
ther may take one year's unpaid leave
after paid maternity leave, and during
this extra leave her job is reserved and
she returns to work without loss of
seniority or pension rights.
Certain other European countries
have also introduced somewhat simi¬
lar arrangements. In Spain after the
period of paid maternity leave, a
working mother may take voluntary
unpaid leave for an additional period
of at least one year and not more than
3 years; at any time during this period
she may apply for reinstatement and
the employer is obliged to appoint her
to the first vacancy which occurs in
the same or a similar category. In
Italy a woman may take an optional
extra 6 months' maternity leave after
the statutory compulsory and exten¬
ded period.
On January 1, 1974, Sweden became
the first country to enact legislation
making cash maternity benefits pay¬
able also to the father. Under this law
either working parent may stay at
home to care for a newborn child and
collect the cash benefit. The husband
instead of the wife may opt for the
period of extended leave or the period
may be divided between them, with
the same safeguards relating to re¬
instatement in employment, seniority
and pension entitlements.
Several countries provide for a
period of birth leave for fathers: in
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S YEAR INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S YEAR INTERNATI
France paid leave of 3 days is reim¬
bursed to the employer by the family
allowance fund, while in Sweden the
period is 10 days. In Norway it has
been proposed that men workers
whose wives are in gainful employ¬
ment should be entitled to from 2 to
4 weeks' child care leave during the
first year of the baby's life and that
benefits be paid to men workers dur¬
ing such leave.
Child care. Despite the steady
increase in the number of married
women workers with young children,
the child-care services and facilities
have in most countries been slow to
respond to new needs. The time is
past when society can refuse to
provide community child-care services
in the hope of dissuading mothers
from leaving their children and going
to work: this flies in the face of facts.
The trade unions in a great many
countries are giving serious and
continuing attention to the problem of
child care and are putting it forward
as a basic right for workers.
Who Works Longer? International
comparative research carried out un¬
der the auspices of Unesco has shown
that, almost without exception, mar¬
ried women generally work longer
hours at home than their husbands
because of the traditional division of
family chores and concept of sex
roles. On the whole, working mothers
had less than two-thirds of the free
time that their husbands enjoyed.
Their total weekly hours of work
amounted to between 70 and 80
Change in the position of women in
economic life, the family and society
implies change in the role of men in
these spheres. In turn, this implies
change in social attitudes, which
themselves define and confine men's
and women's roles in all walks of life.
Problems may be discussed as
"women's problems" but they must be
considered as problems of men,
women and children, of society as
a whole.

the percentage of illiterate women aged 15 and over in the world's major regions in 1970. Out of every 100 women
over 15 in Africa and Asia, 84 and 57 respectively were illiterate, as against only 2 illiterate women for every 100 in
North America and 5 in Europe and the U.S.S.R.

### 49659: For African women equal rights are not enough; the real task is to rethink the role of men in present-day society

FOR AFRICAN WOMEN
EQUAL RIGHTS
ARE NOT ENOUGH
The real task is to rethink
the role of men in present-day society
by TheIma Awori
THELMA AWORI is
National Secretary of
the Uganda Associa¬
tion of Women's Orga¬
nizations. She studied
sociology and educa¬
tion at Harvard and
Berkeley Universities
(USA) and has taught
at Makerere University,
Kampala (Uganda) and
the University of Nai¬
robi (Kenya). Born in
Liberia, Mrs. Awori
has spent ten years in Kenya and Uganda,
acquiring a profound knowledge of the
special problems of the African woman.
THE international cry for equal
rights for women is not the
panacea for the problems of the
African woman. Whether equal rights
have been the solution to the problems
of an oppressed group anywhere has
yet to be proved. It is therefore
necessary that the problems which the
African woman faces be examined and
their nature determined before an
adequate solution is suggested.
My standpoint is that the exploita¬
tion which the African woman expe¬
riences today, as a result of her
changing role within changing social
systems, can only be solved by also
taking a look at the role men play in
society.
So I propose to examine one of the
most prevalent problems of the African
woman today, namely the problem of
increased and ever increasing res¬
ponsibilities, in the light of women's
response to these problems and the
proposed international solution of
equal rights.
When it is said in Africa that the
home is the responsibility of the
woman, the statement is not to be
interpreted lightly. It does not simply
refer to the cleaning and cooking and
child-care, but also to the production
and preparation of all that goes into
making her home.
In the Western world a man works
to "provide" for his family. In the
traditional African sense this is the
responsibility of the woman. The
father was important in that it was
through him that a woman and her
children gained membership of a
group and rights within it. He was
also supposed to be the protector and
custodian of his family and its wealth.
So whereas the wealth, property,
children and even the wife could be
said to be "owned" by the father and
his agnatic group, the responsibility of
maintaining and improving those items
owned by her husband fell to the
wife. Even though the responsibility
was great, at least she had the
assistance of others in the homestead
together with the assistance and moral
support of her husband.
In colonial and post independent
Africa this situation has been subject¬
ed to severe changes. The mobility of
men in search of employment and
education leaves women with the full
burden of the family. From Cape
Town to Tunis millions of women have
experienced what it means to be fa¬
ther, mother, husband, wife even
though they are not widows. The
drift into urban areas and mines leaves
women without the protection and
assistance of their husbands.
Our rural sister is the worst hit by
this mobility. Her husband left her
years ago to find work in the towns.
She might see him two or three times
a year, but the rest of their communi¬
cation is limited to messages and
letters often written by others, since
both of them may be illiterate. If she
is lucky, money may trickle back
home in small amounts for school fees
or as capital for development. Other¬
wise she must engage in farming or
business in order to keep herself and
her children fed and clothed.
The towns and mines forgot she
existed when they planned the one
room for her husband to live in, and
bath and cooking facilities to be shar¬
ed with other single men. His wage
does not take his seven children back
home into consideration. Worse still
he must have his small luxuries
alcohol and a few prostitutes.
If she is very poor her children may

not go to school. They stay at home
and help her with the work. Nowadays
many children go to school or drift
to the urban areas as soon as they are
old enough, leaving a great labour
vacuum in the rural areas. Cattle
have to be tended, the land has to be
ploughed, sowed and harvested, daily
household chores must be attended to.
This situation influenced Kenya's
Attorney General to make the follow¬
ing statement to a conference of wom¬
en in East Africa: "Although wives
have a right to be maintained by their
husbands under customary law, in
effect, the dying influence of custom¬
ary sanctions has resulted in many
abuses, whereby husbands go to work
in the towns leaving their wives in the
country without adequate provision.
This aspect must be remedied."
She is amazingly calm and hard¬
working for all her suffering, this rural
woman. Perhaps we do not take a
close enough look at her face to see
the anxiety behind her eyes and the
rapid aging of her figure. She goes
on from day to day carrying out her
duties, assuming the responsibilities
left to her by her husband. She must
protect and provide for herself and her
household. It is she who has come
to understand and accept the clear
distinction between ownership and
responsibility; not conceptually but in
practice.
As long as she has children her
plight is sealed. It would seem that
the closer the African woman is to
tradition, the more seriously she takes
her responsibility for her children.
Motherhood has a mystical slavish
influence on her. She feels she must
always be prepared to make the
ultimate sacrifice for them a feeling
not equally shared by the father.
A mother is always a child's last
resort. So that to leave her husband's
home would mean leaving her children
in the care of an equally over¬
burdened woman and an absentee
father. This would not be an especial¬
ly favourable situation for the children.
Yet to take them as dependents to her
parents, who themselves need her
help, would be unacceptable to her

people. So she does what is neces¬
sary to maintain her family.
This woman has a lot to teach her
urban sister who finds herself stripped
of traditional protection and barely
able to cope with her new situation.
Even if she does come to realize the
distinction between ownership and
responsibility, it is when it is too late;
after she has had a baby by someone
who admits that it is his, but will leave
the bulk of the responsibility of rearing
the child to her.
Many African countries have Affili¬
ation Acts granting the unmarried
mother rights to claim maintenance
for her child from its father, but the
amount is usually ridiculously small,
sometimes 3 dollars a month. Kenya,
in fact, repealed its Affiliation Act
in 1969.
In other cases she might marry
someone and find that full emotional
and financial support is not as forth¬
coming from him as might have been
expected. The bitterness with which
she accepts this situation shows in her
face and her manners more than in
the case of her rural sister. If she
is a working girl she can take care
of herself. But she is often still in
school and her parents have to bear
the responsibility.
Only an insignificantly small number
of African women, married or single,
are non-income producing members
of their families, whether the income
is in cash or in kind. This is linked
with tradition and with anxiety. The
tradition is that African women have
always worked. The tradition of
polygamy seems to have made it
necessary for the African woman to be
self-sufficient. The anxiety is related
to making sure that ends meet regard¬
less of the circumstances.
In traditional society the anxiety was
not as great because society had
built-in securities for its members.
In the present situation the anxieties,
especially of the urban African woman,
are tremendous. The family structure,
even though still existent, no longer
provides all the security she needs.
She is anxious about her own
support and welfare. She is anxious
about her husband's continued and
undivided affection. Ten years ago, in
Kenya Women Look Ahead (East'
African Literature Bureau, Nairobi,
1965) C. Oloo and V. Cone alluded
to the tensions the modern African
woman experiences. Today these
tensions are full blown.
Many women married to the most
responsible men will fear to praise
their husbands openly. "He is good
today," they say, "but men change,
you know." The anxieties of the
modern African woman are justified.
Men change and the African male has
undergone many changes which have
also caused him anxieties, the most
severe being that of maintaining his
¡mage as "the boss". This translates
itself into very oppressive behaviour
to both men and women.
What is the African woman doing
about her situation? The answer is
contingent upon several factors. As
has been said before, our rural sister
is more calm about her plight,
especially if she is married and
has several children. If she is un¬
married and young, the town is the
answer with its multifarious means of
"happiness", independence, and a life
which is physically less strenuous.
Even as a single girl her relationship
with men is not rosy and totally to her
advantage. She is constantly in
competition with other girls who are
In many African countries little
more than a decade after
independence, the status of
women, at least in its legal
aspects, is often more
favourable than that of their
European counterparts. In their
daily lives, however, many African
women still face discrimination.

BURDENS
OF SOLITUDE
In Africa today many village
women must look after their
homes and support their families
alone and unaided, while their
husbands are absent for months
at a time working in towns often
hundreds of kilometres away.

women on their way to market.

out to get the big spenders, the
"sugar-daddies".
If she accidentally becomes preg¬
nant and the relationship falls apart,
she must take full responsibility for the
child or leave it in the dust-bin, where
the social workers collect babies for
charitable homes.
But if she is lucky and her relation¬
ship with her man continues, the baby
will get support and she might get
her rent paid and even a car. These
girls are the envy of women generally.
Without the obligations of wifehood
they seem to be able to get exactly
what they want from men.
Men also seem to respond better to
this situation, which is free of psycho¬
logical, financial and legal complexi¬
ties. A man can step in or out of it
whenever he likes. Many single girls
and young divorcees find this a per¬
fect situation.
The older, Christian woman will take
her problems to the Lord in prayer.
After all, she reasons, the life of Christ
was a sacrificial one. So why not
hers? Without this attitude many of
our young men and women today
would be unable to boast of an
education and a family home life.
Yet this woman too, unable to leave
an oppressive situation because of her
children, will spend sleepless nights
figuring ways of stretching meagre
earnings and making the best use of
them. She has accepted the res¬
ponsibility-ownership dichotomy and
will take the responsibility.
The most- problematic case seems
to be the younger, more educated
African girl. Regardless of the advice
she receives from her elders, she
psychologically rejects the irre¬
sponsibility of her man, but not with¬
out a battle. This reformist believes in
doing something about her situation
and the battle is often fought on
many fronts psychologically, social¬
ly, financially and sometimes even
physically.
This is the girl who believes that
one's rights are not to be taken away
without a struggle. But with what
result? Often, in defeat, she resorts
to the legal system when she may
secure her divorce, only to increase
her anxieties. The care of three or
four children in a male-dominated
society is no easy task for a single
woman. Besides, society has more
sympathy with widows than with
divorcees.
If her elders prevail upon her and
she remains in the union she does so
with bitterness; a bitterness that
produces ulcers, bad headaches, de¬
pression and aggressiveness. But
this is the fighter for equal rights. Her
anxiety moves her to act. She has
fought for equal pay, paid maternity
leave, housing in her own right, the
right to own property in her own name
even if she is married.
She has succeeded in achieving
these ambitions, but none of these
have improved her relationship with
her husband. The more rights she
secures the more independent she
becomes and the more responsibility
she assumes. Unlike her lucky urban
sister with a "sugar-daddy", she finds
herself contributing more than her fair
share for family maintenance.
The situation is so prevalent, many
women wonder why it is necessary to
have a husband. Somehow the
African man does not seem to respond
well in this atmosphere. He feels
overshadowed, overpowered and hu¬
miliated.
For those who are concerned about
the family as an institution of a healthy
society, this situation in Africa war¬
rants examination from a fresh pers¬
pective. Clearly the struggle for equal
opportunities and equal rights might
be more difficult in some countries
than in others, but African women
within a decade of independence are
miles ahead of their European sisters
in their legal achievements.
In Uganda, as soon as women were
courageous enough to ask for certain
rights, by sending a delegation to the
President, everything they asked for

was granted. In Somalia, a pre¬
dominantly Muslim country with a
military government, women also have
been legally given equal rights. It
would seem therefore that the struggle
for more opportunities and rights for
women (the word "equal" is totally
irrelevant) is not a priority. These are
being achieved with the co-operation
of men.
The problem that warrants attention
is a clearer definition of the male role
in African society today and this
needs to be done in conjunction with
a definition of the female role. Our
men are having just as many problems
adjusting to the changing circums¬
tances of society.
The struggle for more opportunities
for women will solve other problems
in society but not the problem of the
male-female relationship, which is a
human relations problem, and these
are seldom solved by laws.
The prevalent attitude of most men
towards their present situation was
well expressed by one African leader
in a speech to a women's seminar.
He said, "The wife is responsible for
peace and stability in the home. She
must create a safe and steady base
which would encourage her husband
to succeed in the world of business
or employment. This attitude on the
part of women would reduce heavy
drinking and road accidents and would
induce husbands and children to stay
at home." This statement may be
interpreted in many ways, but it must
never be mistaken for anything other
than what it really isa cry for help.
A statement of this nature shows
a strong unwillingness to take res¬
ponsibility for one's own behaviour.
In effect it says, "My role is to succeed
in employment and business, but you
too must get a job or go into business
because I cannot do it alone. And if
I fail, it is really your fault because
you have made conditions at home
so unpleasant for me. You must also
always be prepared to cover the
tracks of my failure by keeping a smil¬
ing face and an appearance of finan¬
cial and psychological well-being re¬
gardless of what I do." The woman,
therefore, becomes the scapegoat for
all his failures, and not being fully
aware of her situation, she fights for
equal rights and thereby becomes a
better scapegoat.
The African woman today must get
rid of this man-child on her back. This
is the responsibility, the burden.
Equal rights will not rid her of this
burden. She must help her man to
stand on his feet and discover his role
in a relationship of equal responsi¬
bility.
The mechanics of how the role of
men will be defined and how men will
become committed to a more re
sponsible role in their relationship
with women is what requires public
discussion and public concern. At
present our men find their profession,
time spent in bars, and other non¬
productive behaviour useful facades
for their problems.
The task therefore that must begin
in 1975, declared "International
Women's Year" by the United Nations,
is the task of helping our men on the
African continent to define their role
in a meaningful relationship with
women. The training of our sons, an
opportunity often forgotten, is an area
of great potential. As for our hus¬
bands and fathers of our children,
the battle seems impossible, but to
win it would certainly be worth the
effort.

### 49660: From a young Burmese girl's notebook

From a young
Burmese sirl's notebook
by Khin Myo Than
THE Burmese girl pays great
attention to dress and likes to
wear her traditional costume. She is
very feminine and may appear like a
fragile flower. Her status has not
changed over the centuries. Is she
dominated by men or subdued by so¬
cial tradition, like women in many
other countries were and are still? No,
and she never has been.
As a little girl, she may play the
same games as her young brother.

make garlands of flowers ? This is not
considered becoming. At the age of
5 or 6, she starts her schooling. Bur¬
mese people accord an important
place to education and culture. They
respect and honour learned people
and teachers, as they do their parents
and elders. The word "daw", equiva¬
lent to Madam, and used in addressing
a married woman, is also used for
young women holding a university de¬
gree or exercising a profession.
Before the British conquest (bet¬
ween 1824 and 1826), education was
ensured by the Buddhist monks, who
for ethical reasons could only take
care of boys. The girl's education was
at home, in the family, but was not
neglected. The British were very asto¬
nished at the high literacy level in
Burma of girls as well as boys. A Bri¬
tish report of 1826 notes that women
"for the most part know how to read
and write", and, "entered with the
greatest warmth into the news and
politics of the day."
During the colonial period the Bri¬
tish introduced the lay vernacular and
the anglo-vernacular schools for the
local people. Burmese parents readily
sent their little girls to these schools.
Whereas, in pre-colonial Burma, par¬
ents kept money to buy jewels for
their daughters, they soon adapted
themselves to the notion that learning
was a gem that no one could steal.
Nowadays, there is a uniform educa¬
tional system for boys and girls.
The end of childhood for the girls is
marked by "nadwin", a sort of "pas¬
sage rite" (1): on reaching the age of
12 or 13, the girl goes through this co¬
lourful ceremony during which her ear-
lobes are pierced. Henceforth, she is
considered to have reached the "years
or discretion". She wears earrings
and assumes greater responsibility in
the family. Soon she will think of
getting married.

(1) At about the same age, the age of the Catholics
First Communion, little Buddhist boys too go through
an initiation ceremony called shin-byu. At this ceremony,
their heads are shaved and they wear the yellow robe
of renunciation to worldly things as do Buddhist
monks. They leave their families, for a certain period
of time, to live the life of monks in a monastery. Here
they are taught Buddhist ethics, among other things.

### 49660: From a young Burmese girl's notebook

Marriage in Burma is contracted
without any civil or religious
ceremony. A young couple
(photo left) wearing their most
beautiful and colourful clothes are
married according to a simple
traditional ritual at the bride's
house in the presence of relatives
and friends. Below right, Burmese
women board an Irrawaddy river

may seem prudish. Young girls and
boys are not seen kissing and hugging
in the streets, and even married cou¬
ples do not walk arm in arm. Flirtation
and dating do not exist. It is only in
a very discreet and chaste manner
that the Burmese make known their
sentiments and feelings. However, this
does not mean that a Burmese girl
lowers her eyes in front of a man, nor
does she stay at home behind doors.
Young girls and boys have many
occasions to meet: at school or uni¬
versity, but also at pwés (open-air
shows that last for three whole
nights), at festivals and even at the
pagoda where one may talk freely,
unlike in Christian churches.
What I may call "reserve" in the
relationship between young people is
equally shared by boys and girls.
Young men, having at an earlier age
gone through the monastery life,
have learnt from the monks to be¬
come detached from worldly things.
They are self-disciplined and respec-
ful towards others. Girls seem more
worldly: they like being coquettish and
elegant and love to wear jewellery.
However, from childhood their mo¬
thers inculcate in their little girls the
forms of social etiquette and among
others, how to behave with men. Thus
girls and boys do not look for casual
affairs but true love and marriage.
With such conceptions, a boy is not
surprised should a girl he "courts"
(by paying her compliments, compos¬
ing little poems, or giving small pre¬
sents) ask him to marry her, if such is
his intention. But when a girl asks
such a question she is already sure
of the answer.
Though parents may wish their
daughter to marry a certain young
man of their choice, the final decision
lies with the girl. Burmese traditional
law recognizes the priority of the sen¬
timents of the couple over the will of
the parents. If parents are opposed
to a marriage, the lovers may elope
to live together.
The very fact of living and eating
together constitutes the bonds of mar¬
riage. As Burmese parents do not
wish to have to put up with the prob¬
lems following marriage by elope¬
ment, they willingly obey the recom¬
mendations contained in the Bur¬
mese law books, the Dhammathats,
which say: "If a daughter desires to
marry a man, her parents should per
mit her to do so, in order to prevent
disgrace."
Wedded, with or without their par¬
ents' consent, the newly married cou¬
ple is not absorbed into the organi¬
zation of the family of either side, but
on the contrary, marriage emancipates
both partners. Both man and wife
leave their respective family and live
apart in their own house. The Bur¬
mese word for marriage, "ein-daung-
pyu", means "set up house."
In Burma, contrary to many other
cultures, procreation is not the main
aim of marriage. Since nothing is
permanent on this earth the Buddhist
family does not trouble itself with its
perpetuation. A Burman marries a
woman to have a life-long companion
and helpmate with whom he shares
his joys and sorrows and his fortune.
One does not have to strive to make
the family name survive since there
are no family names.
A name is something personal. After
marriage the woman keeps her name
without either substituting it by or
adjoining it to that of her husband.
Children have names which have no¬
thing in common with those of their
parents. Whereas in a Western so¬
ciety the mother-to-be and her hus¬
band go through the names of saints
in the calendar and have to choose
the first name (or Christian name) of
the child, in Burma a name is given
much later. The parents observe the
nature and character of the child and
give him or her a name in keeping
with such considerations, as well as
with astrological data (the time and
day of birth).
The name is a whole (not composed
of name and surname) and usually it
has a meaning. The names are gen¬
erally flattering but not always. It may
happen that a little girl is called, for
instance, Wet Ma (little piggy). On
growing up, if she is not happy or
satisfied with such a name, or any
other which may be flattering but
which she feels is not suited to her
character, she can change it (as can
boys) so that it fits her personality

### 49661: Machismo'; Latin America's myth-cult of male supremacy

Machismo
LATIN AMERICA'S
MYTH-CULT OP MALE SUPREMACY
Most of the traits which at any
given epoch have been considered to
be natural biological characteristics
of womanhood are in fact acquired
through the assimilation of customs,
traditions and myths as to the social
roles or functions men and women are
expected to carry out.
In other words, genetically speaking,
one is born male or female, but the
social roles of a woman or a man are
learned; they are a cultural acquisition
specific to each society. It is from
this situation that an abundant myth¬
ology regarding masculinity and femi¬
ninity has developed.
Most present-day societies expect
a woman to fulfil her feminine role
through marriage, as a lawful wife and
mother. However, she can just as
well become a mother without getting
married, and there would seem to be
nothing shameful in that. But society
sanctions the woman who steps out of
line by making her motherhood un¬
pleasant for her.
There are no such sanctions for the
man who fathers an illegitimate child,
though. So it is not surprising that
marriage should have become the aim
of most women in societies, in the
majority today, where an independent
life is not nearly so easy for a woman
as it can be for a man.
The situation of women in these so¬
cieties is made more difficult by the
fact that their upbringing is entirely
oriented towards the goal of marriage.
Not that we have anything against
marriage as such, but it happens to
have become the focal point of a num¬
ber of myths which have gained the
status of social imperatives.
They include the myth of femininity
the myth that marriage is inevitable,
the myth of spinsterhood, of virginity,
etc., and, on the other side of the coin,
the myth of "machismo", of male
supremacy, which is in fact the myth
of woman's "inevitable dependence"
on man and that of man's "natural
authority" over woman. In other
words, of man's superiority in all
things.
How much truth is there in all this?
The tremendous influence of culture
on what the Western Christian world
has held as "natural" in the behaviour
and prerogatives of the sexes has
been demonstrated beyond all ques¬
tion.
On this subject of "male" and "fe¬
male" behaviour and attitudes, the fa¬
mous American anthropologist Marga¬
ret Mead, in her remarkable study of
three New Guinea peoples in the Pa¬
cific (1), has this to say :
"We found the Arapesh both men
and women displaying a personality
that, out of our historically limited
preoccupations, we would call mater¬
nal in its parental aspects, and femi¬
nine in its sexual aspects. We found
men, as well as women, trained to be
co-operative, unaggressive, responsive
to the needs and demands of others.

Societies " (Morrow and Co. Inc., New York).

### 49661: Machismo'; Latin America's myth-cult of male supremacy

^- We found no idea that sex was a
powerful driving force either for men
or for women.
"In marked contrast to these atti¬
tudes, we found among the Mundu-
gumor that both men and women
developed as ruthless, aggressive,
positively sexed individuals, with the
maternal cherishing aspects of perso¬
nality at a minimum. Both men and
women approximated to a personality
type that we in our culture would find
only in an undisciplined and very vio¬
lent male.
"Neither the Arapesh nor the Mun-
dugumor profit by a contrast between
the sexes; the Arapesh ideal is the
mild, responsive man married to the
mild, responsive woman; the Mundu-
gumor ¡deal is the violent aggressive
man married to the violent aggressive
woman.
"In the third tribe, the Tchambuli,
we found a genuine reversal of the
sex-attitudes of our own culture, with
the woman the dominant, impersonal,
managing partner, the man the less
responsible and the emotionally de¬
pendent person."
One could give many other exam¬
ples to show that women are quite
capable of fulfilling not only the roles
attributed to them as women, but also
those assigned to men. There is no
doubt that training, or the lack of it,
and specifically-oriented education
have had a great deal to do with the
way people distinguish between mas¬
culine and feminine roles.
This differentiation began long ago
when work in ancient communities
was allocated according to age and
sex. The practice took root and even¬
tually came to be considered as part
of the natural order of things.
In time the distinction between the
roles of men and women became even
more sharply defined, culminating in
hierarchic societies divided into eco¬
nomic and social classes where the
goal of life was, as it still is, to accu¬
mulate wealth and power.
During the European Middle Ages
women were included among material
possessions as the property of men,
which buttressed the myth of an in¬
trinsic difference between the roles of
men and women so solidly that even
today there are those who use a
variety of irrational arguments in main¬
taining the theory of man's biological
and intellectual superiority over
woman.
In analysing the ideology and beha¬
viour associated with "machismo",
one also needs to examine the myth
of women's dependence on men.
"Machismo", the myth of the supe¬
riority and inborn authority of men
over women, is not only part of tradi¬
tional customs and beliefs in Latin
America, but is very much alive in
modern stratified societies, in many of
which male social supremacy has
been built into laws or has become an
accepted institution.
"Machismo" has become an op¬
pressive ideology expressed in many
different attitudes and forms of beha¬
viour, especially in economic life, em¬
ployment and sexual life. The supe¬
riority of the "macho" (sometimes
translated as "all man" or "he-man"),
which is the essence of the myth,
reveals itself in these and many other
fields, in which the archetypal male
appears as a mythical figure: strong,
dominant, authoritarian, brave, aggres¬
sive, paternal, self-confident, the great
seducer, polygamous and, naturally,
unfaithful.
The counterpart of this myth is the
myth of docile femininity, based es¬
sentially on the idea of woman's social
dependence on man, with the woman
seen as a gentle, submissive, self-
sacrificing, maternal, wifely, obedient
and faithful creature, who must be
respected even while being mistreated
in every sense of the word.
Table published below summarises
the major characteristics of this dual
mythology, as revealed by studies we
have carried out in various countries
of Latin America. A book presenting
the findings of our inquiry is to appear
shortly in Mexico City (El Hombre y
sus comportamientos: respuesta a
Konrad Lorenz [Man and his Behav¬
iour: a Reply to Konrad Lorenz] by H.
San Martin and Sarella Henriquez.)
These characteristics are consider¬
ed "normal" and "natural "by people
in Latin America. In fact they are both
real and mythical. Real because they
are part of the daily existence of men
and women, though of course to dif¬
ferent degrees. Mythical because they
are considered "natural" or innate,
whereas in point of fact they are a
cultural acquisition.
Obviously, this mythology is expres¬
sed in ways which vary from one coun¬
try to another according to its culture
and its social and economic structure,
and the influence of factors such as
religion or cultural exchange between
different ethnic groups living side by
side.
However, the myth is invariably
linked to and dependent on social and
economic structures, even in situations
which have no apparent connexion
with them. For example, the use of
the terms "stronger sex" and "weak¬
er sex" is not ungrounded, in view
of the fact that basically Latin Amer¬
ica's social system sets a higher va¬
lue on men as productive workers than
on women. Completely different open¬
ings are offered to men and women
on the labour market, and the situa¬
tion is scarcely different with regard
to access to education.
This mythology and these social dis¬
criminations lead most Latin American
women, in all but two or three coun¬
tries, to accept marriage as their so¬
cial objective. This is one conse¬
quence of the structure of society, ex¬
pressing the dependence of women
and the oppressive ideology imposed

### 49661: Machismo'; Latin America's myth-cult of male supremacy

by men, whose sense of possession is
extended to wife and family.
The man is the head of the family in
all respects. One of them, which is
of great importance In Latin America,
is the role assumed by the honour of
the family. This has given rise to sub-
myths, such as that of "purity and vir¬
ginity", which always applies to wives
and daughters, but never to men or
boys. This situation was legalized by
the "Indian Law" introduced in Latin
America by the Spaniards in colonial
times.
We find a similar interpretation of
the "purity" of women among the
castes of Sri Lanka and the Malabar
Coast in India, where girls are married
at an extremely early age, before pu¬
berty, perhaps with the aim of defen¬
ding this "purity" through a commit¬
ment to arriage and fidelity. In these
places a well-known proverb affirms
that "men's honour is preserved
through their womenfolk."
Latin America and Asia are by no
means the only places where this kind
of situation is found. Sociologists
have studied the concept of "honour"
in Mediterranean rural communities of
Europe, and have noted that the func¬
tion of "honour" is similar to the
Latin American idea, particularly to
the concept as it still exists in Mexico
and Colombia, for example.
The important thing is not to lose
sight of the fact that these mytholo¬
gies relating to the sexes are oppres¬
sive and discriminatory. The family
and social institutions tend to pro¬
duce a man or a woman rather than
a person. In other words, the roles
of male and female in society are attri¬
buted even before the child's persona¬
lity is sufficiently developed to assume
them. Children accept these roles un¬
consciously, though they may reject
them later on as adults when the my¬
thology is exposed for what it is. It is
at that point that women begin to de¬
mand their emancipation.
The influence of these myths can
also be clearly seen in the reasons
given by men and women for wanting
to get married. In a survey carried
out in Chile between 1968 and 1970
we obtained, among others, the fol¬
lowing results:
Reasons for marriage:
Chilean women
To get away from home and
be free	 19 %
Loneliness 14 %
Fear of becoming an old
maid 13 %
Because she thought she
was in love 	 13 %
Parental pressure 	 12 %
Because she was really
in love	 11 %
To have and run her own
home 7 %
Because she needed sup¬
port	 6 %
Because she wanted chil¬
dren 5 %
Reasons for marriage: Chilean men
To affirm his masculinity . . 27 %
To father children, thus
proving his virility 	 21 %
To have a companion to
help him in his home life . . 14 %
For economic advantages
and social prestige 	 14 %
Sexual attraction 14 %
Love	 7 %
Other reasons 	 3 %
So we can see that the Chilean
woman's main reason for getting mar¬
ried is to free herself from parental
control, although in fact she imme¬
diately becomes dependent, economi¬
cally and in other ways, on her hus¬
band. We also find given here as rea¬
sons for marriage other characteristics
of the feminine myth: fear of becoming
an old maid, submission to her parents'
wishes, her need for support and pro¬
tection because she feels unable to
stand on her own feet.
As for the Chilean man, he clearly
reveals his own mythical concept of
his personality when he declares that
his main reasons .for marrying are to
set up a family and have children, thus
affirming his masculinity and proving
his virility to the world at large. Only
then does he refer directly to his fu¬
ture wife, but merely as someone to
do the housework and look after the
children.
It is no mere chance that love
comes low down on the list of reasons
given by both men and women for get¬
ting married. This shows to what ex¬
tent the social system can influence
such highly personal decisions and
behaviour. It also reveals how male
possessiveness and other mythical
concepts carry more weight than what
should be the real basis for marriage:
a spontaneously loving relationship
between a man and a woman.
But, one may ask, what are the
social and historical realities out of
which this myth has grown and flou¬
rished?
The main characteristics of Latin
America's social systems today are
economic dependence, social under¬
development, a rigidly hierarchical
social structure, inequality of oppor¬
tunity between different groups, and
a system of values which, like the
male mythology, is handed down, pro¬
pagated and imposed through a syste-

matic education, the family, the mass
media, and so on.
People are living in a state of alie¬
nation, unable to make use of Latin
America's natural resources for human
development. The unending struggles
for freedom In the continent are proof
of the alienating situation in which the
great mass of the population is living.
In social conditions such as these
and with a system of values which
discriminates in favour of men, women
are obviously in a precarious situation
and this is everywhere apparent in
education, work, social security, the
university, civil rights and so on.
And yet according to a world survey
carried out some years ago by Unesco
(2), no country has laws obstructing
the access of women to education,
employment or a full social life. This
may be so in theory, but in practice
things are quite different.
Argentina, Chile, Cuba and Uruguay
are the Latin American countries
where women have fullest access to
all levels of education, to employment
and to civic life. Yet even in Chile,
for example, only about 25 per cent of
women of working age are actually
employed, and whereas in 1952 the
number of women with jobs totalled
25.3 per cent of women of working
age, this figure had dropped to 22.4
per cent by 1970.
The drop in the percentage of work¬
ing women, a general tendency throug¬
hout Latin America today, is due to
a failure to develop means of produc¬
tion and to the social stagnation resul¬
ting from economic dependence.
Other factors must also be taken
into account. The fact that a woman
works does not necessarily mean that
she is emancipated or enjoys equa¬
lity of opportunity with men, since
women are still under submission to
their husbands and there is a differ¬
ence between the kind of jobs open
to men and women.
Similar inequalities exist in educa¬
tion and the professions. Enrollment
statistics for women students in Chi¬
lean universities over the last ten years
show that the majority of women were
studying for four professions; educa¬
tion, pharmacy, the social services
and nursing. Similar findings emerge
with respect to non-professional work.

i>> in Chile are employed in "women's
jobs": in the textile industry, shops,
the services sector and foodstuffs.
And so it is clear that the problem
of women's economic dependence
and the whole mythology of their in¬
feriority to men is directly linked to
the economic activity and structure of
the country in which they live and has
nothing to do with the fact that they
are women.
If women play no part, or at any rate
too small a part, in society, it is be¬
cause they have been prevented from
doing so by social factors and not
because of their biological or psycho¬
logical characteristics. The world-wide
revolt of women and young people
today is a reaction to a historical
situation created by the "society of
the adult male."
Today women and young people are
claiming their rightful place in society.
This is not a conflict between genera
tions or between the sexes, still less is
it an aggressive attack on adults, as
Konrad Lorenz claims; it is simply the
legitimate outcry of a large section of
the population which has hitherto
been deprived of its responsibilities
and its rights.
What adds confusion to the situa¬
tion is the fact that we are witnessing
a pseudo-emancipation of women: cer¬
tain superficial aspects of the male-
female mythology are, it is true, being
demolished, but genuine freedom has
yet to be achieved. This is because
there can be no real emancipation of
women until men too have been fully
emancipated.
Women will not achieve their free¬
dom simply by leaving their parents'
home to get married, or by working in
offices and factories, only to find their
household chores waiting for them
when they get home.
On this subject the noted American
philosopher, Herbert Marcuse, has
made the following comment: "If this
is supposed to mean that all women
should get out of the house and find
a job, I don't see how it can be called
liberation. There would simply be
thousands upon thousands more sec¬
retaries having to sit for over eight
hours a day in an office taking idiotic
dictation from idiotic bosses on idiotic
matters, or standing for eight hours
a day in front of a conveyor belt. This
is not liberation."
Women can be free only in a society
that is free, and this cannot happen
unless men too are free. Women have
the same social problems as men.
Consequently, the liberation of both
sexes from dependence, from situa¬
tions created by myths, and from alie¬
nation, must be treated as a problem
of mutual concern which they must
solve together.

better. In the towns, a simple an¬
nouncement in a newspaper as to the
change of name is enough.
As marriage has no metaphysical
significance, there is no need to say
"yes" before a priest or a mayor. The
ceremony is performed in the pre¬
sence of the families and friends who
are all witnesses to the marriage.
Wearing their most beautiful and
colourful clothes, they all meet in the
house of the bride.
The ceremony is very simple the
couple superpose their right hands on
a cushion and they may eat out of the
same silver bowl and the marriage is
pronounced. After marriage, they do
not wear wedding rings as in western
societies and there is no outward sign
as to whether one is married or not.
The union is symbolized by the silver
bowl which the couple keep precious¬
ly in their home.
The law relating to marriage has
been for centuries in advance of that
in most Western countries. The rights
and responsibilities of both partners
are equal and reciprocal. As long as
marriage subsists, all property con¬
stitutes an indivisible whole. There is
no marriage contract and the system
of a joint estate is the only existing
one. Marriage is maintained by the
mutual accord of husband and wife.
In Burma, divorce may be obtained
by mutual consent, unlike most coun¬
tries where this is still impossible and
one partner to the marriage has to
prove a fault committed by the other.
In case of divorce by mutual consent,
each spouse takes what belonged to
him before the marriage. Acquisitions
made during the marriage are consi¬
dered as common property which is
divided equally between the spouses.
Though divorce is easy to obtain, it is
very rare.
The equalitarian ideas of Burmese
Buddhist customary laws are so strong
in the country that they also influence
non-Buddhists. An example is the
Burma Muslim Dissolution of Marriage
Act. This measure, which was appro¬
ved by the Burma Muslim Congress
without undue difficulty, became law
in March 1953. It gave Burmese Mus¬
lim women rights equal to those
of Buddhists: equal opportunity to di¬
vorce their husbands, and a right to
the return of their marriage portion
on dissolution of the marriage.
This measure occasioned loud pro¬
tests in some other Muslim countries
where the wife had no redress against
the arbitrary decision of a husband to
carry through a divorce, with or with¬
out cause. The Burmese Muslim wo¬
man has now the same status as her
Buddhist sister and like her goes forth
unveiled.
Marriage and, more generally, rela¬
tions between men and women are
based on equalitarian terms. In France,
for instance, a man "gallantly" gives
up his seat to a woman and lets
her pass before him. Burmese women
do not receive such attention from
their menfolk. As a matter of fact,
in Burma the rules of precedence are
based on age and not on sex. Bur¬
mese people are very respectful to
their elders. Thus, a woman gives
precedence to a man older than her¬
self.
On the other hand, French gallantry
does not seem to be found in family
life. At home after work, a French¬
man seems more preoccupied in get¬
ting into his slippers, watching televi¬
sion or reading his newspapers than
helping his wife with the household
chores. He finds it natural that his
wife, who has also worked the whole
day, maybe in a factory or an office,
should now do "overtime" on so-
called "female duties": looking after
the children, cooking, serving at table
and washing up, etc.
Though Burmese men, in the eyes
of Westerners, may not appear gallant
in public, they do not hesitate to share
in the family tasks. A Burman is not
ashamed nor is he considered "effemi¬
nate" when he does the cooking or
wasrjes the dishes. It is not un¬
common to see a Burman holding his
baby in his arms and walking up and
down a room humming a lullaby before
putting the baby to bed, while his
wife may well be reading a newspaper.
Even though the Burman finds it na¬
tural to do some of the housework, it
is nevertheless the woman who has
the responsibility of looking after the
home. Generally, she is in charge of
the family budget. Traditionally, trade
too has long been in the hands of
women.
In the markets, smoking their big
cheroots (Burmese cigars) or chewing
betel nut, women offer their wares or,
from an eating stall, sell dishes which
were probably prepared by their hus¬
bands while they themselves were
getting dressed up to go to market.
Young women often run little shops,
and thus have many opportunities of
meeting young men and maybe their
future husband... In any case,
married or not, Burmese women are
very sociable and are reputed for
their keen business sense.
Thus, traditionally, men and women
have worked in a complementary way.
Nowadays, industrialization has fur¬
nished new types of work to which
women have quickly adapted them¬
selves. Alongside men, women have
taken the road leading to workshops,
factories and offices. They have

Letters to the Editor
ESKIMOS AND THE RIGHT
TO SELF-DETERMINATION
Sir,
I greatly admired your issue "The
Eskimos, a People that Refuses to
Disappear" (January 1975). It showed
us the Eskimos with their traditional
customs and culture, but above all the
confrontation that exists between this
age-old civilization and the modern
world.
The open letter from Chief Dan
George was a poignant reminder of
this situation. Whenever a people be¬
comes subject to outside domination,
it begins, little by little, to disintegrate.
That is why self-determination must be
a universal rule applying to all peoples.
Unfortunately, far too many have been
denied it, and your issue is a salutary
reminder that we should pay far more
attention to this crucial problem of our
time.
I hope you will find space to deal
more fully with the subject in future
issues. You deserve the highest praise
for the quality of your articles and their
presentation.

NOT A BURDEN ON SOCIETY
Sir,
In the discussion of the problem of
population growth and providing people
with all of life's essentials, especially
food, Julian L. Simon in the May 1974
issue of the " Unesco Courier " indicated
that " babies consume but do not
produce " and that they do not affect the
gross national product "for 20 years
or so ", and therefore many persons
fear that if there are more people now
" there will be less resources left for
people in the future. "
On the other hand, your October
1973 issue justly condemned the fact
that at present 40 million of the world's
children under 14 years of age are
workers.
Thus, in one case, children produce
nothing (and only consume), while in
the other, they only work, and do so
to the detriment of their health and
their physical and mental development.
I would like to point out a solution
that avoids both extremes, one that has
been proposed by two outstanding
educators (Robert Owen in the U.K. in
the 19th century, and Anton Makarenko
in the U.S.S.R. in the 1920s and 30s)
and confirmed in practice and experi¬
ments. It consists of combining work
with study and training, beginning at
about nine years of age.
The opportunity for this has been
created by machine production, which,
unlike manual labour, does not require
great physical strength. Machine pro¬
duction actually created the need for
combining work and study because it
is based on the application of natural
scientific knowledge, which people master
most successfully when they work in
large factories and apply scientific and
theoretical knowledge in practice.
In A.S. Makarenko's experiment,
500 children from the ages of nine to
18 supported themselves, the school
and the factory entirely by their own
labour, and spent 40,000 roubles a
year on visits to the theatre, 200,000
roubles for trips and excursions for the
whole collectivity, besides giving the
state a net profit of 5 million roubles a
year. In other words, each child pro¬
duced 833 roubles of profit a month (at
the exchange-value of the rouble during
the first half of the 1930s).
The children worked four hours a day,
and all received a secondary education.
Not only did they learn a trade, but
even more important, former waifs and
strays became worthy members of
society.
Combining work in machine pro¬
duction with study has a positive effect
on the training of personnel, on the
growth of labour productivity and the
development of industry and technology,
and it is beneficial to the health and
physical development of children and
adolescents, since their work time is
limited (from one to three hours,
depending on their age), and they are
not employed in harmful fields or on
night work.
The main thing Is that their work is
tied in with their training and develop¬
ment. At the same time, the problem
of eliminating juvenile delinquency is
fundamentally resolved.
When society solves the problem of
combining work and study, children and
adolescents will play an entirely differ¬
ent role in population growth. Would it
not be worthwhile to consider this
important factor in discussing demo¬
graphic questions?

South East Asia. Inversely, men may
be typists or stenographers. In Burma
there are no small ads listing
"women's jobs".
Equalitarian ideas in Burma have
given women access to work at all
levels. The country has no institution
of higher learning like the French
"Ecole Polytechnique", which till
recently was not open to women.
Burmese society readily accepts the
fact that women occupy high-ranking
posts in different spheres of life, even
certain posts that were only occupied
by men during the colonial period.
The evolution of society has enabled
women to play a new role in the
community compared with the time
when their responsibility was usually
at the level of the family (as traders
and heads of small businesses, etc.).
Whereas in France, for instance,
some women are often more interes¬
ted in reading "women's, magazines"
than in following politics, in Burma,
there are no "fashion magazines", and
since the times when they could be
queens or myothugyis (hereditary heads
of a group of villages), Burmese wom¬
en have always been interested in
political affairs. Since independence,
women have been deputies and minis¬
ters, and women flock eagerly to the
polling booths. It is estimated that 80
per cent of Burma's women voted in
the 1960 elections.
Under such conditions, it is not sur¬
prising that Burma has no Women's
Liberation Movement. Burmese women
have nothing to fight for in a society
that has always been called a "society
of equals", in every sense of the term.

Mithila, lying between the Ganges and
Nepal, in the Indian state of Bihar, will
be held at the Louvre Museum (Paris)
from March 21 to May 19, 1975. In the
past the kingdom of Mithila, centre of
a remarkable civilization, was a matriar¬

Unesco Director-General's
tribute to Sir Julian Huxley
The great English scientist Sir Julian
Huxley died in London on February 14. A
brilliant zoologist, a biologist of world¬
wide reputation for his work In embryology,
and a noted popularizer of science, he was
Unesco's first Director-General, from 1946
to 1948.
On learning of Sir Julian's death, Mr.
Amadou Mahtar M'Bow, Director-General
of Unesco, paid the following tribute: "Sir
Julian Huxley was one the major architects
of Unesco and gave its work some import¬
ant directions which still mark its activities.
From these may be selected its interest In
problems of the environment and the pres¬
ervation of nature, for in 1948 these were
by no means widely regarded as matters for
international concern. It was under his
leadership that Unesco concerned Itself
with the creation of the International Union
for the Conservation of Nature and Natural
Resources.
"Sir Julian's term of office," Mr. M'Bow
continued, "saw the conception of Unes¬
co's first major work of co-operative Inter¬
national scholarship, the History of the
Scientific and Cultural Development ot
Mankind, with which he remained asso¬
ciated after relinquishing office.
"Above all, perhaps, It was his vision
as a scientific humanist that Sir Julian gave
to Unesco. To him, science was an Instru¬
ment of man's power and he was concern¬
ed that It should be rightly used along
with education and culture in the service
of welfare, peace and justice. It is this
legacy which those who work with Unesco
treasure today."
Unesco story

Unesco has brought out a 4,000-word
Braille booklet describing its current
activities and its work during the past
30 years. A cassette recording of the
booklet is planned for blind people who
do not know Braille. Requests, written or
In Braille, for free copies of the booklet,
which has appeared In English, French and

Japan's
$20 million gift
to U.N. University
Japan has given $20 million to the
endowment fund of the United Nations
University In Tokyo, as part of its pledge
of $100 million to the new university during
the period 1974-1978. The Government of
Senegal has contributed 5 million Central
African Francs ($22,000) to the university, In
response to a Unesco General Conference
request, last November, for Member States
to augment the university endowment fund
by voluntary contributions, as well as giving
moral and material support.

'Equal pay

"Women Unite". "Equal
Pay Now", proclaim the
posters carried by these
British women on the
march at a recent natio¬

London. Their militant
spirit echoes that of
the British feminist
movements which were
among the pioneers in
the world-wide struggle
to win equal rights for
women almost a cen¬
tury ago. See pages
