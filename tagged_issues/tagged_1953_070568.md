FOUR weeks ago, the Editors of the"Courier"where pleased to
receive a letter from Dr Jose Pedro Puig, Director of the Educ-
ational Library and Museum of t  National Council of Primary
and Secondary School Teaching in Montevideo, Urugay. In big
letter, dated August 24th, Dr Puig wrote :
I wish to express my sincere congratulations on the contents
and presentation of the"Courier"and for the material it publishes
on the various problems and efforts in education of the different
countries of the world.
Our library has just taken out 100 subscriptions to the
"Courier"which we are making available to small educational centres
in the mural, isolated areas of Uruguay. In this u'ay, we feel that,
despite our small financial means, we can do our part in helping to
make the goals and achievements of Unesco better known.
To Dr Jose Pedro Puig of Uruguay we send our sincerest thanks.
And as a special mark of appreciation for his efforts, Unesco is sending
him a free copy of the Human Rights Exhibition Album (in Spanish) as
well as a series of other books and pamphlets.
Since the"Courier"launched its drive for new subscribers early this
year, there has been a steady increase in subscriptions from readers in
all parts of the world.
In Japan, the University of Kyushu has subscribed to 15 copies. In
Sweden, with the help of the National Commission for Unesco, new
subscriptions last month topped the 1, 100 mark. In Djakarta, Indonesia,
the Ministry of Education recently placed a bulk order for a total of
1, 300 subscriptions for use by teachers and students in schools.
WITH THIS ISSUE, THE"COURIER"OPENS A SECOND DRIVE

### 70557: Herbert Spencer was on the right track a hundred years ago
OCTOBER 1953. Page 3
This is how Abdalla, aged 13, of Egypt, drew a train on a viaduct.
HERBERT SPENCER WAS ON THE RIGHT
TRACK A HUNDRED YEARS AGO
Taketoshio, aged 6, Japan, dit it this way.
and Kishore, aged 7, India, like this.
THE spontaneous attempts made by children to represent the men/,
t houses, trees and animals around them... are familiar to all...
This effort to depict the striking things they see is a further
instinctive exercise of the perceptions... What is it that the
child first tries to represent ? Things that are large, things that are
attractive in colour, things round which its pleasurable associations
must cluster-human beings from whom it has received so many
emotions ; cows and dogs which interest by the many phenomena they
present ; houses that are hourly visible and strike by their size and
contrast of parts. And which of the processes of representation gives
it most delight ? Colouring. Paper and pencil are good in default
of something better ; but a box of paints and a brush-these are
the treasures. The drawing of outlines immediately becomes secon-
dary to colouring...
Now ridiculous as such a position will seem to drawing-masters
who postpone colouring and who teach form by a dreary discipline
of copying lines, we believe that the course of culture thus indicated
is the right one... No matter how grotesque the shapes produced ;
no matter how daubed and glaring the colours. The question is not
whether the child is producing good drawings. The question is,
whether it is developing its faculties... it may be readily inferred that
we condemn the practice of drawing from copies ; and still more so
that formal discipline in making straight lines and curved lines and
compound lines, with which it is the fashion of some teachers to begin...
It has been well said concerning the custom of prefacing the art of
speaking any tongue hy a drilling in the parts of speech and their
functions, that it is about as reasonable as prefacing the art of walking
by a course of lessons on the bones, muscles, and nerves of the leg ;
and much the same thing may be said of the proposal to preface the
art of representing objects, hy a nomenclature and definilions of the
lines which they yield on analysis. These technicalities are alike
repulsive and needless. They render the study distasteful at the very
outset ; and all with the view of teaching that which, in the course of
practice, will be learnt unconsciously.

### 70558: International exchanges through art education
Page 4. OCTOBER 1953
INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES
THROUGH ART EDUCATION
Y Ol' : \'G children are endowedwith the gift of seeing the
\vor) d about them intuitively,
with an innocent freshness as yet
unaffected bv the rational dictates
of experience. One of the chief
concerns of any mode of education
must therefore be to retain as much
as possible this natural awareness
in the child and yet provide a
method of training that will truly
educate.
The purpose of education is not
only, in the famous words of Franz
Cizek :"to let the children grow,
develop and mature."It has also
to be a mode of initiation so that
each person may be as well
equipped as possible for living his
own life and for contributing to
the good life of others and of the
community.
It is in this respect that education
by means of the arts is so valuable
because it fosters the whole
development of the personality,
uniting intellectual activity with
physical skills, but fusing them in
a creative process that is in itself
among the most precious attributes
of man.
From its inception Unesco has
recognized the value of education
through art as a means of enriching
the individual development of
young people and for promoting
international understanding.
When in 1949 art education
specialists came together to discuss
Unesco's programme for art educ-
ation, they laid the greatest emphasis
on the need to foster international
exchanges of all kinds-exchanges
of information, techniques, ideas
and beliefs, exchanges of art
teachers and of the art work done
by children in different countries.
That principle of exchange and
inter-communication has since
characterized much of the work
of Unesco in this field.
For example, letters requesting
help in arranging exchange activ-
ities reach Unesco from all parts
of the world. Typical of many
requests is the following :"I am a
teacher in an elementary school
and although I am not a specialist
in art and have to teach all subjects
in my class, we are doing what I
think is very interesting work in
arts and crafts. I would like very
much to be able to exchange some
of the work done by my children
with that done in a school in
another country."
A brown paper package
A few weeks ago, a large brownpaper'pack e arrived at
Unesco from a group of
children and their teacher in
Africa."Children's Paintings-
Free Gift"read the description
on the Customs declaration form.
Inside the package was a collec-
tion of delightful paintings and
pictures and a letter which began :
"Dear Friend, We do not know
you but we are sending you these
drawings so that you can know
us as your friends. You can see
what we look like and the place
where we live and what we do..."
Just a week before, a similar
parcel had come from children in
Guatemala and Austria, and a few
months ago others had arrived
from schools in Germany, Den-
mark, Egypt and Mexico. In a
school in the United States the
teacher and children made a set of
miniature slides in colour to
illustrate the kinds of art work they
were doing and sent them to
Unesco in Paris.
From countries all rover the world
small collections of children's art
are now being sent to Unesco.
Small selections from these
drawing and paintings have been
sent on loan for exhibitions in
different countries. More frequent-
ly, however, Unesco links one
request for exchange with another
so that works of children's art can
be inter-changed directly between
schools and countries.
Recently, the president of the
Japanese Association for Promot-
ing Educational Arts sought the
aid of L'nesco in arranging ex-
changes of chHdren's paintings with
some 20 Member States of Unesco.
About 400 drawings were exchang-
ed as a result between Japan and
each of the 20 countries. Thus a
total of some 8, 000 pictures created
by 8, 000 children travelled across
the world to carry images not only
of aesthetic and educational value
but of goodwill and understanding.
The same Japanese association
Recently an international competi-
tion was organized by the Danish
Section of the International Union
for Child welfare in which
children were asked to illustrate
stories written by Hans Christian
Andersen.
For some time past the Indian
illlustrated journal, Shankar's
Meekly, has arranged an annual
international competition, publish-
ing an illustrated issue of the
journal entirely devoted to the
literary and artistic work of
children. Similarly, the Sunday
Pictorial in the United Kingdom
arranges an annual competition
and exhibition for which the prizes
are in the form of scholarships to
study at one of the art schools.
All these exhibitions and ex-
")'m a farmer"by Ralph, aged 6, U. S. A.
has now produced a portfolio of
colour reproductions of pastel
drawings by Japanese children
which Unesco is sending to each
of its Member States as a gift from
the Japanese National Commission
for Unesco and the Japanese Asso-
ciation for Promoting Educational
Arts. (FOUl'of these pastels a1'e
1'epl'Oduced on pages 10 and 11.)
what has been done in Japan is
but one of many examples of the
actin and practical monments
which are a striking feature of art
educational developments on an
international basis in recent years.
International exhibitions of child
art have been arranged under
Unesco auspices or by its National
Commissions in Australia, India,
Ceylon, Guatemala and Italy.
Many others have been organized
priyately or nationally in other
countries.
For manv vears one of the best
organized schemes for exchanges
of children's art and music work
has been sponsored jointly by the
National Art Education Association
of the United States and the
International Junior Red Cross.
changes, like the comparable
schemes for the international ex-
change of correspondence and
yisits between children, contribute
to the building of a world-wide
network of understanding and
communication between peoples.
The most significant fact is that
here is international exchange and
cultural diffusion'which exists on a
large scale, which has extended at
an astonishing pace in the past few
years, and which seems to have
originated spontaneously in many
different places, symptomatic of a
widespread and genuine need and
desire.
It may not be apparent to one
or two teachers in a particular
country or to a few in another
country, but when the evidence
from many places is taken together
and viewed as a whole, there are
clear signs of an almost revolution-
ary change of attitude to art
education in the past decade.
One of the most significant
ennts of the past two years was
the Seminar on the Teaching of the
visual Arts held in Bristol,
England, which brought together,
through Unesco, teachers and spe-
cialists from many countries who
were directly concerned \vith
practical problems of art educa-
tion. They experienced the value
of international exchange for
themselves, they recognized the
necessity for it and decided to set
up the necessary organization for
its promotion.
They have founded the Inter-
national Societv for Education
through Art (INSEA) which is
open for membership to national
groups and individuals. One of
its tasks will be the organization of
exhibitions of original works by
children and kodakrome slides for
circulation internationally.
A world survey
THE founders set forth their basicbeliefs in the Preamble to the
Constitution of the Society in the
following terms :
"Art is one of man's highest
forms of expression and communi-
cation ; Creative activity in art is
a basic need common to all people ;
Education through art is a natural
means of learning at all periods
of development of the individual,
fostering values and disciplines
essential for full intellectual emo-
tional and social development of
human beings in a community.
"The association on a world-wide
basis of those concerned'with
education through art is necessary
in order that they may share exper-
iences, improve practices and
strengthen the position of art in
relation to all education."
Next year a regional seminar on
the teaching of the arts and crafts
will be organized by Unesco in
Tokyo, in co-operation with the
Japanese National Commission
and other authorities.
Meanwhile, Unesco has just
published a volume which may
well be unique in this domain
of education. Entitled I"Art and
Education : A Symposium" (1),
this 250-page book-one of
Unesco's most attractively-present-
ed volumes-contains 45 essays
surveying the field of visual art
education, the basic theories, the
variety of techniques and materials
which are in use, the problems of
training and administration, the
role of the amateur and the special
needs of art education for youth
groups and for adults.
A notable feature of the volume
will be the illustrations which
have been selected so as to
present in vivid pictorial form the
main theme of the nature of art
education. Over 100 black and
white and 28 colour plates show
children at work and examples of
their drawings, paintings and
modelling. There is also an illus-
trated plan for an art room.
Art teachers, parents, leaders of
youth groups, organizers of art
clubs, and those concerned with
general education, child guidance
and child psychology will find the
scope of the publication extremely
valuable. The book will also
appeal to the general reader
interested in culture and in chil-
dren not only because of its subject
matter but also for the quality and
character of the illustrations.
The articles published in this
special issue of the"Courier"will
appear in unabridged form in the
new Unesco volume. The photos
in this number are taken either
from this publication or from col-
lections sent to Unesco's centre of
information for art education.

### 70559: The Child who does not draw is an anomaly
"On the road to Louviers"by Reine, one of Pierre Duquet's pupils, aged 11, France.
THE CHILD WHO
DOES NOT DRAW
IS AN ANOMALY
by Pierre Duquet
Teacher at Creuse, Somme (France).
Prix Monnier for art teaching in schools 1950
"Shepherd"by a Nigeria. child.
' ! n the green field"by Jacky, another of Pierre Duquet's pupils, aged 9, France.
THE urge to artistic expression isan imperative need in every
child. None can escape it.
Although for those children who are
constrained and bullied, who lack
the freedom and the material means
to give full rein to the urge, this
need may perhaps not be so strong,
the scribbles and furtive drawings
that they make on the walls and in
the margins of their exercise books
bear ample witness that it exists
and persists.
A child who does not draw is an
anomaly. Particularly so in the
years between 6 and 10, which is
outstandingly the golden age of
creative expression.
Up to the age of six, the thought
and behaviour of the child have been
predominantly egocentric. From
that age onwards, his mentality be-
comes less centred on himself and
turns towards social behaviour
which is gradually submitted to the
discipline of reality and reason.
The small child does not at first
have any idea that his scribbles
should represent real objects. He
draws lines and scribbles, just as
formerly he used to gesticulate and
babble incessantly. Then one day,
he finds a resemblance between the
scribble he has just made and some
object in real life, and he gives it
the name of the object.
One of his first achievements is
generally a symbol for a man, which
will be subjected to all kinds of
transformations and endowed with
different attributes, while remaining
over a long period basically un-
changed, although actually evolving
all the time.
Design grows larger
AT this age from 4 to 5, spon-taneous expression is as
much subject to the changing
moods of the child as is a game he
plays. He endows his creations
with intentions that he has been
unable to carry out. He tells a story
about what he could not express in
the drawing. The action becomes
more important than the person.
He does not always indicate where
this is taking place. Only what is
essential for the action is formu-
lated. A figure may have only one
arm, the one being used.
Generally, he begins in one corner
of the paper and works outwards,
beginning calmly then becoming
more and more active, the elements
of the design growing larger and
being drawn more quickly. And
then, when he has covered it all,
when the temptation of that empty
surface has been satisfied, or some-
times quite suddenly when interest
is exhausted, he will stop.
By the time he is six years old, the
child has acquired, or soon will,
control over the movements of his
hand so that he can make his pencil
or paint-brush define or diversify
the shapes and areas he wants.
This is the stage of outlines, specific
tasks, definition of objects drawn on
a two-dimensional surface where
the ideas of space and volume are
apprehended but not expressed. He
becomes aware of his sheet of paper
as a limited area with its demands,
its shape and its potentialities.
At first he places the various ele-
ments haphazardly on the paper but
soon he fills it up, in a kind of
enumeration, without any apparent
connexion other than the impulse
of the moment. Then the base line
representing the ground begins to
appear, and a rudimentary form of
codification is imposed. Organiza-
tion of the design comes in and
people, trees, houses stand up from
this base line, while sun, clouds and
birds are moved up to the top of the
paper, the place where the sky is.
'No man's) and*
LATER on, after a period in whicha kind of"no man's land"
exists between sky and earth,
devoid of colour, they are united
and the paper is thus divided into
two zones. The area of the page
has been conquered. The child
clings tenaciously to this schema
which he has imposed upon himself ;
his creative expression becomes
organized and controlled. He begins
to relate areas full of detail with
empty spaces and these begin to
take on a significance of their own,
so that the total effect tends to
achieve a plastic harmony.
I should like to emphasize how
extraordinarily plastic the schema
of the child becomes at this age.

### 70559: The Child who does not draw is an anomaly
Page 6. OCTOBER 1953 UNESCQCOUR
'Our teacher"by Irene, aged 6, Great Britain.
6 TO 10, THE GOLDEN AGE
OF CREATIVE EXPRESSION
(Continued from previous page)
The drawing of animals from the
side with their four legs, of human
figures full-face, and of things from
their most significant aspect, all
contribute to the grouping and
composition.
If the child is encouraged to vary
the format of his work, he very
quickly acquires through free art
the faculty of thinking plastically.
It is at this stage that the child
acquires his first notions of social
awareness which coincide with his
entry into the small community that
is the school class.
The school class is a collection of
children who are equals, but a
grown-up, the teacher, directs it.
What is he to be, enemy or friend ?
At this point the serious problem
arises as to the attitude of the edu-
cator towards creative expression.
Will he know when to stand back
in order that it may continue to live,
or will he kill it by interfering ?
The first condition of success is to
gain the child's confidence. When
he first enters the classroom the
child makes contact with an en-
tirely unfamiliar environment ; and
for the first few days, while he is
adapting himself, what occupation
can he be given to prevent him from
feeling lost ?
Let him have a pencil. He will
begin to draw and his first free
drawing, having been sympatheti-
cally regarded by the teacher, will
be the determining factor of the
child's adaptation.
At home perhaps his scribbles
were not very kindly received. Here,
at school, they appear to be impor-
tant. He finds that the teacher is a
friend he can trust ; this very fact
inspires the child with self-confi-
dence.
Free drawing forms the first
bridge across the gulf between pupil
and teacher, child and grown-up.
It is the first manifestation of a
language, of a means of expression
with which the child is most at
ease ; it will facilitate the first ex-
change and help the child's first
steps in learning.
Let everything be done through
art for art. Each new piece of
knowledge should be fixed in his
memory through pictorial represen-
tation not by a sample drawing by
the teacher, but by one thought out
and expressed by the child himself.
Once confidence has been estab-
lished, is it enough to encourage
this natural bent which is ready to
flourish, and to go on with the
game ? Is the teacher, who has
provided the conditions favouring
creative expression-equipment, a
varied supply of good quality mate-
rials and freedom of action for the
child-now to remain an amused
spectator during these sessions of
free expression ?
Is it not the teacher's role to
awaken the child's inner sensibilities,
to be his counsellor and friend ; and
in the first place to be a technical
adviser ?
The child has to become familiar
with the materials, the tools. He
must learn to handle pencil, paint-
brush, chisel, to know their poten-
tialities and the most practical way
of using them. There is a right way
to dip a brush in colour, to paint so
as to avoid blobs of water or patches
of dry paint, to use a chisel without
hurting oneself. Colour must be of
the right consistency to spread cor-
rectly when applied ; the master
must teach innumerable small tech-
nical details in order to save time...
and materials.
He will teach the use of tools, but
not the work. Can a child's drawing
or painting be called his"work" ?
Work implies intention, effort, will-
power, conscious responsibility and
many other qualities which it would
be premature to demand from a
child at this impulsive and unstable
age, but which will be expected of
him later.
Creative expression provides a field
in which the child develops his un-
conscious artistic qualities but where
"Learning to read"by Alfonso, aged 12, Mexico.
he can also learn to develop his
character. He can be taught to
persevere in his efforts, not to be
easily satisfied with them, to set
himself high standards, to be honest
with himself, and this is where the
educator is needed.
Should a competitive spirit be en-
couraged in children ? I think there
should be neither competition nor
marks. Each child should learn
from his own experience and follow
the laws of his own development.
Should copying be forbidden ? It
would be useless to forbid it, since
at this age the child is, consciously
or unconsciously, an imitator, but
his own creative expression is en-
riched by his borrowings for he assi-
milates them and makes them his
own.
What, then, should be the teach-
er's attitude during a session of
free creative expression ? He should
stimulate his pupils, but never
prompt them. He should stir their
imagination and strengthen their
emotional life by a procedure com-
parable to the method of Socrates.
He should ask questions which bring
to light new ideas or new details. If
the child has decided to draw his
home, he can be asked whether he
is going to show us his mother and
father, the dog, the pigeons on the
roof, his baby sister asleep in her
cot, and so on.
In this way his imagination will
be aroused and he will gradually
cover his paper with the objects
that he knows from his daily life or
that he has just discovered ; his
vision will be enriched and he will
be able to put more of himself into
his drawing.
Without in any way defending the
distortions and clumsiness found
in child art, it is important to
remember that there is more to
them than that. They are the fruits
of both will and instinct, of both the
conscious and subconscious mind.
It is by preserving the child's first
fresh original vision that the way
can be paved for successful personal
research in the future. Sympathy
for his first efforts will give a child
encouragement to discover his abi-
lities and remain true to his own
character.
What in fact do these first efforts
of his represent ? The character of
his drawings remains the same as
in the preceding period-in other
words, drawing for him is a game,
into which he throws himself on
the whim of the moment, covering
sheets of paper with confused, inco-
herent scribblings, repeating the
same shapes over and over again,
or juxtaposing objects at random ;
but the difference is that he now
begins to aim at something more
coherent and significant.
This is the age of avid enthu-
siasms and thrilling discoveries. He
begins to draw everything he sees.
And the shapes he uses begin to
vary, come to life and take on
human semblance.
He begins also to be accurate and
takes pains to be legible and wants
to be understood. Imagery will be
born, with the help of finer instru-
ments and materials that are more
appropriate and flexible, and so lead
on to stricter perfection.
Differences begin to appear in the
symbol for a human being which
the child draws, differences of sex
and age. Heads are covered with
manes of hair ; humanity is divided
into those wearing skirts and those
wearing trousers. Everything he
draws now has a kind of life of its
own.
Very soon the child throws all
restraint to the winds and oversteps
the bounds of prosaic reality to
revel in the crazy realm of won-
derland, of the strange and the
funny and the marvellous. His men
have two heads ; his horses lay
eggs. It is as though he felt the
need to try out his new weapons,
and test his own strength. And his
strength lies precisely in his blissful
unawareness of rules.
He now knows of course, that the
objects he is drawing belong to the
supernatural and he himself laughs
at what he is doing, whereas, at an
earlier stage he found no cause for
amusement in the distortions he
inflicted on his figures in an effort
to copy from real life.
Inconsistencies of scale, with
abnormal enlargement of certain
parts ; transparent drawings show-
ing the insides as well as the
exterior and, above all, neglect of
perspective are not, strictly speak-
ing, errors. In fact, they can only
be called errors with reference to
photography, but who would accept
that as a standard ?

OCTOBER 1953. Page 7

The child's first attempts to rep-
rESent what he sees usually begin
at about the age of eight or nine,
a transition period, during which he
draws partly from memory and
partly from imagination and obser-
vation. Gradually, he begins to
aim at accuracy and a life-like re-
semblance ; he becomes the slave of
his eye.
While he still clings to his old
pimitive drawings, he now feels the
need to base them on reality, and he
therefore turns to the external
world for first-hand information.
Provided his desire for self-expres-
sion has never been repressed, he
will now do this entirely sponta-
neously. It is possible though that
school lessons and the development
of his reasoning and critical faculties
may have killed his spontaneity.
cretism and universalism. The man-
ual and visual skill he has acquired
incline him to repetition, to super-
fluities, to effect for effect's sake,
with the result that his creative
expression becomes stagnant or
even recedes. This is the mo-
ment when he needs a motive for
self-expression. He takes a liking
for illustrating stories, anecdotes,
his own experiences, any set subject
needing an external compulsion to
unleash his creative mechanism.
The golden age of plastic expres-
sion is over ; it has been replaced
by what may be called the academic
approach. If left to himself at this
transition stage, he may well lose
his first flush of confidence. Up
to this point he was only dimly
aware of his own awkwardness, but
now the veil has fallen from his eyes
ART MUST BE PRACTISED
TO BE. APPRECIATED
It is a mistake to deline a world 01 art and set it apart from line. For that reason
it is a mistake to teach the appreciation 01 art, lor the implied attitude is too detached.
Art must be practised to be appreciated, and it mu ; f be taught in intimate
apprenticeship. The teacher must be an artist no less active than the pupil. For art
cannot be learned by precept, by arry verbal instruction. it is, properly speaking, a
contagion, and passes ! Me rire rrom spirit to spirit. But always as a meaninglul
symbol, and as a unifying symbol. We do not insist on education through art for
the sake of art, but for the sake of life itself. - Sir HERBERT READ.
Hitherto, there has been a fertile
dualism between play and reality.
Now it seems as though reality will
win the day. Play has lost its
enchantment and the child begins
to worry about visual realism.
His creative expression is affected
by this change and the ideas and
information he is acquiring invade
his drawings. The objects conform
to a single scale of values. Details
that formerly were enlarged as the
fancy took him, haphazard and with
gusto, poetically scattered over the
paper, are integrated in the whole,
making it accurate but more
commonplace. The child's poetic
vision of his world gives way to a
rational vision.
At this stage he takes a new step
forward in mental development. His
critical sense is born and an analy-
tical spirit gradually replaces syn-
and looking at his drawings impar-
tially, he realizes that he is helpless
to represent what he sees. The little
world of his imagination is crumb-
ling about him.
It is very necessary to guard
against the child becoming discour-
aged by helping him to get away
from those ready-made formulae
which he repeats now without
much conviction. His logical facul-
ties must be appealed to and the
subject must be discussed with him,
by questioning him about the diffi-
culties that hinder him. It is im-
portant, above all, that the child
shall not be inhibited because his
drawing is incorrect and does not
agree with objective reality.
Ready-made solutions, on the
pretext of helping him and saving
his time, must be avoided at all
costs. He does not need to be given
ideas. The value of self-expression
is not proportionate to knowledge
and dexterity. There is a problem
to solve, and the child must be made
aware of it and know that he has
to solve it for himself.
The teacher must therefore inter-
vene, but he will have to exercise
consummate tact and skill to avoid
pushing the child into the facile
course of purely realistic photogra-
phic representation, devoid of all
emotional significance.
It is vital not to destroy what has
already been built up. It is at this
period, in fact, at the age between
6 and 10, that the child's individual
instinctive bent, an integral part of
his emotional make-up, and one
which is to determine all aspects
of his future life, practical, emo-
tional and intellectual, first comes
to light, and begins to develop
towards self-realization.
In order to achieve this aim, Pes-
talozzi once said, the teacher's
approach, more especially when
dealing with the subject of creative
expression, must be that of a gar-
dener rather than a potter. Expres-
sion is essential for the fulfilment
of the ego ; but there can be no
fulfilment under constraint, or by
copying a compulsory model.
The child can of course learn to
imitate, but imitation can never
teach him self-expression. Instead,
he learns to give the appearance of
self-expression, and-which is
dangerous-to cheat, and play
with something that has no sub-
stance, escaping from his ego, de-
personalizing himself. When this
happens, his sole desire will be to
lose himself in the crowd, which
will think and act for him.
Effective knowledge is measured
not by the bulk of information
acquired, but by the use made of
it, and the results obtained. The
first effective act is that of the
small child who succeeds in ex-
pressing himself in some concrete
material, and experiences the satis-
faction of doing so. Apart from
the accruing benefits of knowledge
and skill, the experience of creative
expression contributes to develop, on
both the conscious and the sub-
conscious plane, the qualities of
initiative, will-power and a desire
for self-fulfilment, which will come
to fruition in the grown man.

THE question of art education can! hardly be dealt with in isolation
where young children are con-
cerned, for children do not separate
the joy of creation from the joys of
seeing, laughing, admiring, talking,
singing and feeling. For them, all
these joys are used in a single one :
that of living.
Thus the ric. hness or the poverty of
their childhood environment can have
a decisive effort on their creative
expression. Put them in severe
surroundings where everything is for-
bidden, and you will make them timid,
uncommunicative and lethargic beings
with little inclination to give vent to
their feelings or express themselves.
Place them in a happy atmosphere in
a place designed specially for them,
where they can run about, touch,
observe, experiment and build, and
they will reveal themselves, and will
often produce ravishing things reflect-
ing their happiness and enthusiasm.
"For life, through life"was the
saying of Dr. Decroly, who attached
great importance to the background
provided for the early school years, on

rounded with

you long to sit

cil and scissors.

nettes of every

children, where

warding work or his aversion for com-
pulsory and unproductive tasks.
What must we provide for these
small children if they are to give
themselves completely to producing
something which reflects their yearn-
ings and their curiosity ? A house
similar to the one from which they
have come, but richer, full of varied
attractions, and live materials which
appeal to their childish interests. But
all too often the family home is ar-
ranged purely for adults ; everything
has to be in order there, an unchang-'
ing order to suit the grown-ups..
"Don't move that""don't touch this",
"don't make a noise"-all those para-
lysing and discouraging'''don'ts''.
There must be more understanding
and tolerance in the school, within, of
course, certain limits as to dirtying
and destroying things. There the
child must feel able to lead its eager
life of curiosity, full of imagination
and fantasy, of enthusiasm for cons-
tructive work which allows him to
combine his efforts with those of
others and to contribute his personal
note to an orchestra in which
everyone surpasses himself in the
desire for perfection and originality.

friends, full of fun and easy
enough for them to understand,
comedies or tragedies in which the
parts can be played by chickens and
cocks., pigeons and ducks and guinea-
pigs-naive and amusing imitations
of the living and lovable animals
which are kept as pets in and around
the school.
In another corner, there are three
large tubs, full of big blocks for build-
ing houses, trains, garages and
whatnot in a hundred and one in-
genious combinations, The finished
works will be explained, discussed
and admired, and you will be invited
to play the approving part of an
amused spectator. Further on there
are little carpenter's benches with
saws, hammers, nails, small planks,
reels, wooden bolts and boxes.
All this will come to life and take
shape under patient hands, already
skilful and often highly imaginative.
Delightful things, little boats and
planes, will be born in this magical
place and, thanks to the paintbox and
the brushes, will be given a gay, spick-
and-span appearance that will compel
your admiration.
Further on again there are easels
where budding artists can make their
first attempts and go on to express
more and more clearly what they feel
and what excites them, in pictures
which later on their creators will
criticize, sometimes in the most amus-
ing way.
Everything should be free : the
choice of subject, the composition, the
size, the colours. The only guide should
be the inspiration of the moment,
entirely sustained by the personal
confidence and the joy of the creator ;
the great reward will be when the
teacher hovers near unobstrusively
eager to collect and show the work.
Although drawing as such is not
used in painting, there will be plenty
of it done otherwise. Drawing
arouses and trains observation in the
classroom and in nature ; it stimulates
and renews the imagination.
Another fascinating activity is the
direct cutting-cut of coloured paper,
without previously drawing any
design. This is often group work.
calling for a certain attention to
details and exercizing beneficial effect
on the conception of ideas. The table
on which this. work is done is never
deserted. The lively colours attract
the little ones who, adoring the use
of scissors and pots of paste, some-
times produce masterpieces of which
they are very proud.
We should always remember that
every child possesses particular
creative faculties, variously orientated,
so that, if you want to foster and not
to destroy these, you must not pres-
cribe an identical series of activities
for all children. After all, what
counts most from the educational
point of view is not the result achiev-
ed, but the profound joy experienced
in creating.
There is yet another room nearby.
a quiet one, where anyone can go
when he wants to be alone. Some-
times children feel the need to with-
draw from the whole group, to escape
from the noise, to take part with a
few friends in collective educational
games in which they can succeed,
without grown-up help, by using their
own thought and judgement.
Life in profusion, offering all its
innumerable shades and forms, utterly
captivating, that is the spark that
will set alight the creative power and
rouse the desire in the child to com-
municate his rapture. The turtle-dove
on her eggs, hamsters with their
swollen cheek-pouches, nibbling at
their food, white mice caring for their
little pink babies, tiny yellow chickens
pecking under their rudimentary
incubator, the aquarium with its
intricate pattern of quicksilver
wonders, leaping frogs, newts,
salamanders, land the water-beetles
that make a nest like a little boat.
There are silk-worms weaving their
white, green or yellow cocoons and
bean seeds thrusting out shoots under
the damp cotton-wool ; as well as the
spades and little rakes for work in
the tiny gardens, the watering-can
that spouts rain and the pool to
paddle in.
all this is not gathered together
just to furnish subjects for drawing,
like the stuffed animals and plaster
casts provided in traditional schools,
but is there to welcome the young
child, to greet him, to teach him to
caress, to cherish, to see and under-
stand. It is this sum total of sur-
prises which will make his fingers
itch to get hold of a paintbrush and
his eyes eager to see his own more
personal creations.
"Mummie, come and look ! It's
pretty, Mummie."That is how the
toddler will sum up his first impres-
sion when he enters this enchanting
world. No one can long resist the
fascination of such an atmosphere.
Once captured, the little new pupil
will waste no time getting to work.
Hammers, paste-pots, clay, and
scissors will all be at hand.
He will imitate, he will feel his way,
and find it, for all these different
kinds of enticement will enthral him.
He will measure, guess, talk, sing
dance, act and also, in his elation,
will draw, model and paint.
None of these activities will interfere
with the others ; on the contrary,
each will support, illuminate, and
strengthen the other. The develop-
ment of the child's artistic aptitudes
will be the culmination and consum-
mation of other no less useful and
valuable forms of development.
That does not mean that creative
activity should be in the wake of
other disciplines ; often it occupies a
central place very favourable to the
flowering of the child's capacities. It
will impel him to talk, to observe, and
to think ; it twill incite him to ask
questions, to calculate and to experi-
ment. It will be a priceless stimulus
to a host of other activities, instruc-
tive as well as educative.
Having at such an early age begun
to do things for himself, he will want
to gain more insight and gather more
information, in order to do even better.
A particularly successful picture may
be the starting point of a host of
enquiries of more detailed investiga-
tions, or an unforeseen chain of
relationships that will take all of the
little group out to the flowers in the
garden or the animals in the enclosure
and find its mimed and spoken
consummation in the puppet-theatre.
The little builder who has withdrawn
into a corner to admire his work will
feel the need to share his delight ;
perhaps he will persuade his admirers
to work with him and to organize
together some more imposing cons-
truction, to the great gain of the
social education of this charming and
industrious community. Since he will
be accustomed to meet with respect
for his creative expression, whether it
be spoken or artistic, not only will he
acquire confidence in his own powers,
but he will also value those of others,
whose ability and originality he will
have learned to appreciate.
All this activity, freely carried out,
in common with all the individual and
collective reactions it involves, will be
aimed not so much at revealing par-
ticular talents and spotting future
geniuses as at enlightening the child
about himself and the teacher about
the infinite variety of his world of
little people.
To provide as many opportunities as
possible for the child to express
himself and to flourish, that is truly
our essential responsibility. And in
so doing we too shall have our fill of
rapture.

Page 10. OCTOBER 1953 UNESCO COURSE ?
CHANGING PATTERNS
IN INDIA
By K. G. Saiyidain
Joint Educational Adviser and Joint Secretary, Ministry of Education, India
My own memory of schooldays in India during
the second decade of the
century, identifies art with the
laboured drawing of vertical
and horizontal lines with a hard
pencil, a boring and meaningless
exercise which was supposed to
develop gradually into geome-
trical drawing : a useful thing,
I presume, for professional
surveyors and draughtsmen, but
about a. s closely related to the
release of creative impulses in
children as, say, the pumping of
water to the joyous experience
of graceful swimming. This
tended to deaden the interest of
children in art and curbed their
natural love of self-expression.
The education administrators
themselves were more preoc-
cupied with the achievements of
tangible results and the teaching
of. subjects which could be
easily measured by the mecha-
nical yardstick of the exami-
nations. Being themselves the
products of an educational sys-
tem which was soulless and
artistically barren, they were
not able to appreciate the true
value of art education or know
how to encourage it in schools.
Deadly drudgery
auks, in consequence of theinexorable chain of admi-
nistrators without vision,
teachers lacking in skill, area-"
tive ideas or training, and chil-
dren obsessed with examina-
tions, art continued to be the
neglected part of the curri-
culum.
There were, however, certain
forces working in India, in the
social, political and cultural
fields, which aimed at bringing
about a national renaissance.
An attempt was made to link
education more closely to life
outside the schools and to re-
integrate the relationship bet-
ween formal education and
folklife-folk art, music,
drama, and literature. This
new movement has so far
reached only a minority of the
schools, for in most of them the
old deadly dull drudgery of
drawing persists. But there is
no doubt that in many pro-
gressive schools, and in quite a
number of art schools, the new
outlook and approach are being
increasingly adopted.
In the revision of ideas about
the teaching of art in schools,
and the greater emphasis that
is being placed on the intuitive
and rhythmic aspects, it is not
only indigenous influences, but
the practical work of inspired
art teachers like Franz Cizek,
the great Austrian pioneer, and
the ideas of art critics like
Herbert Read, w h i c h have
played a part. Exhibitions of
free art work done by children
in other countries, notably Aus-
tria and England, have quicken-
ed teachers'ideas and imagi-
nation about what can be done
in this field.
Obstacles to art
THESE examples from otherplaces show a similar feel-
ing for rhythm and sen-
suous beauty, as well as the
approach through intuition, to
that found in Indian and
Oriental art.
The main obstacles which
have stood in the way of the
development of creative lines of
art education in India may be
summed up as follows : failure
to recognize the true place of
art in education ; undue impor-
tance given to examinations ;
lack of properly trained teachers
with the right ideology ; inade-
quacy of funds, and shortage of
necessary equipment.
Concerning the first point,
there has been a marked
change for the better. There
is growing realization that art is
not only an essential and inte-
gral part of general education,
but that no other subject can
possibly fill the role which it
plays in the development of the
child's personality and in the
proper orientation of his
emotional life.
The second difficulty, con-
cerning examinations, is a
tougher proposition because,
despite all the criticism that
enlightened educational opinion
has levelled against them, it
, has not been found possible yet
to replace them by something
better. In regard to art, the
incidence of this difficulty is
greater because it is a subject
which by its nature does not
lend itself easily to the rigours
of a mechanical examination.
The dilemma is that if it is
made an examination subject,
the whole spirit in which art
teaching Should be carried own is
defeated ; if not, teachers and
students both tend to neglect it
and relegate it to the back-
ground. The way out can only
be found when there is a radical
change in the examination sit-
nation as a whole, of which, in
recent years, there is some
welcome evidence.
Then there is the problem of
teachers, which includes not
only their right training but
also the difficulty of actually
providing schools with trained
teachers. For financial reasons,
it is not possible to provide
every primary school with an
art teacher, nor sometimes even
every secondary school and,
therefore, the plan now being
worked out is to make art edu-
cation an integral part of the
syllabus in all teacher training
institutions, so that the general
teacher can also serve as an art
teacher.
No need for luxury
THE fourth problems is also at difficult one. In schools
'*'which cannot provide
paints, brushes, paper, crayon,
coloured paper and other mate-
rials, even the best of teachers
feel seriously handicapped in
evoking and satisfying the art
impulses of the children. Added
to this is the depressing fact
that many schools and homes
are in themselves inartistic.
However, so far as materials
are concerned, in preference to
imparting costly items from
abroad, attempts are being
made to use inexpensive mate-
rials locally available.
Where the exploitation of a
variety of local material-s helps
to develop the initiative and
creative resourcefulness of the
teachers and the children, it
can be of great value both
educationally and artistically.
Nevertheless, we must reco-
gnize that if we believe in the
value of educating our children
we must also believe them
worthy of the best resources
which we can provide ; and that
there is a certain minimum of
good quality materials which
must be supplied if any kind of
reasonably good results are to
be expected by the administra-
tive authorities. In art edu-
cation, there is no need to be
luxurious ; but we must at least
strive to be adequate.
Thus attempts are being
made, with some measure of
success, to deal with the many
problems involved in the orga-
nization of art education in In-
dia. We are not by any means
satisfied with what has been
achieved but the situation today
is decidedly more promising
than it has been for decades,
and there is hope that it will
continue to improve.

### 70562: The East meets the West in Japanese art education
COURIER OCTOBER 1953. Page
THE EAST MEETS THE WEST IN
JAPANESE ART EDUCATION
THERE are people, especially inthe Orient, who speak of"the
scientific West and the spirit-
ual East". This may be partially
true, for undoubtedly science is more
advanced in Western countries, but
it may be excessive to suggest that
Eastern cultural development is the
more spiritual.
In the field of the visual arts
modern forms of expression are not
necessarily superior to those of
former times. Quite po. ssibly the
scientific developments of Western
civilization have involved a comple-
mentary neglect and consequent
decline of artistic sensibility. In
that respect, Oriental forms of civili-
zation, which are not so highly
mechanized and scientific in charac-
ter, may have preserved certain
qualities which can be of value to
the West.
The essential quality in Oriental
art is a simplification and a sym-
bolization that, although often ap-
parently realistic in detail, actually
achieve a kind of abstraction, as in
the multiple stone figures on the
surfaces of buildings. This also
derives in part from the techniques
employed, which are based on tra-
ditional formulas, as in the detailed
carving of ivories or the skilful
working of small objects in various
kinds of metals and the complicated
processes involved in lacquering.
Most of the examples of work in
these materials which are familiar
to Western peoples are noteworthy
for their minute detail and realism.
But when you look closely it is ap-
parent that the underlying design is
far from verisimilitude and is a non-
realistic. often lifeless, abstraction.
Formal abstraction
A GAIN in painting, and in the artfor which Japan is renowned,
namely coloured woodcuts, the
manner of setting out the simple
washes and brush strokes, the inclu-
sion of written texts and the im-
portance given to the placing of the
signature as part of the spatial
design, all contribute to an effect
3f formal abstraction.
With the impact of Western civi-
lization during the nineteenth
century and up to the present time,
it was difficult for the arts in the
Orient to escape from the influence
of the so-called realism of Western
art. However, a tradition of
genuine realism has not been estab-
lished in Eastern countries, whereas,
in the Western countries even
the various forms of"modern"art
are, in fact, basically developments
arising out of what is fundamental-
ly a tradition of striving for realism.
Eastern countries found them-
selves in the inevitable situation
where modern Western civilization
was imported and imposed upon
them, and, it must be admitted, in
Japan this was openly sought and
desired in order that the country
might take its place in the assembly
of modern nations. But our tradi-
tional pattern of culture was still
essentially feudalistic in character.
Scientific and technical develop-
ments had to take place. In the
process Oriental civilizations have
been under great strain ; they have
been like persons with split person-
alities, no longer safe in the old and
not yet fully adapted to the new.
This is a situation of extraordinary
significance and implication for art
and art education. Technique and
style in the arts are rooted deep in
something that lies beyond the
merely visual. Hence those tra-
ditional styles and techniques in
Oriental art, which appeal so much
to Western connoisseurs, are in fact
echoes of the spirit of a former age
and have become mannerisms which
cannot be regarded as creatively

Council Member, National Art Education Association, Japan
relevant. so our present phase of
evolution.
The problem is how to adapt our
teaching to the new conditions while
still retaining those traditional ele-
ments which are true for us and
worthy of retention. Naturally,
many Western visitors to Japan
advise us to admire our own tradi-
tions whereas, in ordinary life, we
are busy swallowing Western fas-
hions and ways of living. It is
useless telling us to return, in the
arts, to those qualities which are
only stylistic, because we of the
younger generation in the East think
that the modern methods and
discoveries in art belong not exclu-
sively to the West but to the world.
Therefore, in our schools, the situa-
tion is undergoing changes.
There has been a fundamental
revolution in administrative, spirit-
ual and technical approaches to
education generally, especially under
the recent influence of the occupa-
tion authorities, so that the intro-
duction of primary, lower and upper
and esteemed as a means of free
self-expression. Interest has been
aroused in the general public
through many exhibitions of chil-
dren's pictures arranged by various
institutions and newspapers.
Secondly, more efforts are being
made to cultivate the pupil's capacity
for art appreciation, instead of the
traditional training in skill. For
this purpose reproductions of various
works of art of all countries have
been introduced.
Thirdly, the concept of visual art
as a branch of education has been
greatly enlarged from the limited
sphere of fine arts to include com-
mercial arts, industrial arts, and all
kinds of decorative arts, aiming at
the unification of art and life
through resolving the problems of
visual beauty in daily life.
Lastly, research on methods of
evaluation, especially objective and
scientific methods, has been started.
As in many other countries, the pro-
gressive teachers have had to face
many objections from the conserva-
some time, for the first requirement
is to build ordinary classrooms.
On the administrative side, the
Ministry of Education and the boards
of education in every prefecture and
the big cities, have their own ad-
visers or consultants for art teach-
ing, but small cities, towns and vil-
lages do not. A course of study for
art education, a kind of teacher's
manual, has been drafted by the
Ministry of Education. As teachers
who are really capable of carrying
out the new methods of art educa-
tion are still scarce some such guid-
ance is necessary ; but it is even
more desirable, as soon as possible,
to train good specialists in large
numbers. Training centres for art
teachers are rare. Consequently
the majority of special teachers now
working are professional painters,
and few opportunities for their re-
education can be envisaged under
present conditions.
There are numerous societies and
associations. Each prefecture has a
teachers'association for research in
art education. The national con-
vention meets once a year. There
are many other societies and re-
search institutes which hold training
.. Little Girls,"by Yukimo, Kubomachi Primary School.
secondary schools, and the democra-
tization of the theory and practice
of education, are epoch-making
events.
With regard to art education the
same dilemma arose as in relation
to adult artistic problems. The tra-
dition in the schools was based on
the earlier view, incidentally still
widely held, that art was only for the
talented few and that all art teach-
ing should be done by artists. Con-
sequently, the education authorities
had little interest in promoting art
education for everybody, and the
professional artists did not approach
teaching from the point of view of
understanding the child, but of
training further professionals in the
conventional styles.
Gradually, a more perceptive atti-
tude is gaining ground and methods
are being promoted in accord with
progressive approaches to the art
education of the child. The deve-
lopments in Japan can be summed
up as follows :
First of all, in the lower grades,
visual art education is understood
tive ones. Nevertheless, the new art
education is prevailing in spite of the
lack of materials and equipment and
the fact that specialist teachers have
been trained only as painters.
The Ministry of Education, and
private enterprises, are producing
various visual aids and films to pro-
vide for the appreciation of master-
pieces and the understanding of
some technical processes. Some
magazines for art education are
being published by institutions and
associations of art teachers and the
first issue of The Journal ot Japanese
Art Education, a publication of the
Unesco Art Education League in
Japan, appeared in September 1952.
One of the real difficulties we are
now facing is the very serious short-
age of classrooms, especially in pri-
mary and lower secondary schools,
due to wartime devastation and the
demands of the new educational
system. Hardly any schools, except
for those which escaped damages,
have special rooms for art teaching.
Moreover, we cannot expect adequate
special equipment in every school for
classes and organize workshops.
With and through the children we
are thus solving some of the pro-
blems which have arisen from the
confrontation of East and West. We
have profited from the experiences
of pioneer experimenters in art edu-
cation in other countries, we have
looked at the methods being em-
ployed in American and European
schools, but we do not intend blindly
and slavishly to copy in our art edu-
cation the content and techniques of
the work done elsewhere. Child art
everywhere in the world has certain
qualities in common and the
experience of creative art education
can everywhere be a liberating one.
But there is also a national flavour
and a quality in the art of children
in each country, and that is certainly
true of what is produced by Japanese
children. Those who took part in
the Bristol seminar thought that this
work, like that of the Egyptian chil-
dren, had something to offer to
children everywhere. Here, in my
view, is a clear way of using the arts
to increase mutual understanding.

Page 12. OCTOBER 1953 UNESCO
ART FOR THE ENJOYMENT OF IT
ALL of us are in some degree artists and to some
extent educated through art. The measure of our
achievement will depend, moreover, upon where we
live, what we do and the kind of people we are.
Wherever we are and whatever our condition, we have
in common our humanity and our potentialities for
creative expression, whether we paint a fine picture
or make a first sketch.
Yet there are degrees and kinds of creative expression
so that, as in other human activities, we make a
convenient distinction between the specialist and the
amateur. My present concern is not with the professional
training of the specialists, but with the art education
of the adult in general, with those referred to in the
Declaration of Human Rights as having the right to
enjoy the arts. Of the millions who make up the
world's population, relatively few in fact are enabled
to assert this right.
Art still tends to be readily available only to
comparatively few, although, from the historical point of
view, presumably more people today have opportunities
for appreciating art than ever before. But apart from
those who lack opportunities, there are those who do
not avail themselves of the facilities which exist.
Enjoy is a word that, at first glance, evokes the idea
of easy pleasure. Admittedly, many things can be enjoyed
intuitively with apparent ease, for example, pleasurable
effects to be found in nature such as a brilliant sunset.
But enjoyment in art is something which has to be
acquired through experience and that means some form
of education.
Possibly much of the inability of the average adult
to enjoy art is the result of faulty education rather
than an innate defect. We are by nature endowed with
the faculties for creative expression, but all too often
we have been either ill-educated, so that other faculties
were developed at the expense of the creative ones,
or we have been deprived of the facilities, materials and
opportunities for their full expansion.
In these respects, there is evidence enough to show
that, fortunately, many thousands of children now being
educated will not be able to make such complaints when
they reach adult life. But there is also, less happily,
plentiful evidence that enlightened approaches to
education through the arts are by no means universally
accepted and encouraged by educational authorities, even
for children, and are far from being sponsored in the
education of adults.
Of the various agencies which engage in adult art
education, there are in the first place such obvious and
major ones as press, theatre, music, film, radio and
television organizations which exercise an enormous
influence, not always necessarily consciously directed
to educational ends and, indeed, more often than not,
activated by commercial rather than cultural motives.
Now that by means of television, the visual image can
be taken to the spectator wherever he may be, this
influence may become immeasnreable for good or ill, by
reason of its indiscriminate diffusion.
Adult art education strictly addressed to individuals
rather than to mass audiences is often sponsored by
universities, colleges, evening institutes, art museums,
libraries and art schools.
There is a general tendency in the provision of these
art courses for the academic institutions to sponsor studies
in appreciation, and for the practical art schools to
arrange activities in techniques ; but progressive
by Trevor Thomas
institutions, such as some art museums, often arrange
for both types of course. Indicative of the nature of
the two approaches are such titles in the syllabuses
as, on the one hand,"The Lives of the Great Artists"
and, on the other,'''Practical Leathercraft for Beginners".
In principle the idea of such courses is excellent ; in
practice they may suffer from unfortunate defects, in
part due to a prevailing idea that the arts are not
serious subjects but marginal frills in the curriculum,
but also arising from the attitudes and qualifications of
the teachers and the attitudes and aptitudes of the
students.
Tutors in the academic types of course may find it
difficult, after a number of years of ringing the changes
on the few topics within their competence, to keep their
lectures fresh and alive. Practical instructors usually
have to teach regular students in the daytime and so
arrive too fatigued by evening to give their amateur
pupils the lively attention they need. The people who
attend these courses consequently often begin in genuine
desire and enthusiam, continue year after year out of
force of habit and end in disillusioned despair.
"Portrait"by Betty, aged 15, U. S. A.
Of recent years many employers have arranged for
the part-time education of their employees and many
professional and trade organizations undertake similar
responsibilities for their members. Such typical
groupings as trade unions, nationalized enterprises, cho.
operative societies, agricultural federations and so on,
frequently sponsor art education programmes which
include lectures and recitals, exhibitions and excursions
as well as classes in practical instruction.
Here again, the quality of these ventures depends on
whether or not trained leaders are employed. Firms and
organizations which could not conduct their normal
business with the aid of amateurs mav nevertheless find
these sufficiently suitable for directing the cultural
welfare of their employees.
Probably the best of all agencies for adult art education
are those which are created by people for themselves
in response to their own needs, such as clubs and
community groups. These are of various kinds, often
primarily social in nature, and the arts may form but
one aspect of numerous activities, as for example, very
frequently in the programmes of youth clubs.
The leaders have to cover a wide range of interests
and may not be specialists in any particular field of
art. The urgent need of such groups is for good
instructional books and leaflets, and in some countries
these are produced by headquarters organizers in
consultation with experts. These are better than nothing,
but there are many educational dangers inherent in the
"how-to-do-it"type of booklet. Nothing can replace
good personal teaching and direct participation.
Just as there are vital and moribund kinds of practical
art so also there are moribund and vital ways of
appreciation, and the last of these, creatively arranged,
can be one of the best ways of conducting adult art
education.
I am thinking, in particular, of some personal expe-
riences which were richly rewarding, with various adult
groups during a time of war, when many people had
erroneously foretold the temporary demise of the arts.
In the event, although great masterpieces'''went under-
ground", the spirit of desire for art burned more
clearly and widely than in times of peace.
Thus, I was called upon by military authorities-and
this was in itself indicative of the prevailing attitudes
towards the arts-to conduct brief courses in art
appreciation for members of the armed military forces.
Shock tactics were necessary, since in the short time
available the only hope of making the slightest inroad
on the defenses of these men and women who Were
bored and cynical about service life, was 10 organize
cultural commando raids. Talk was of little use. They
came expecting to have an easy, idle time.
Actually, they were obliged to participate actively
all of the time in sheer art appreciation experiences,
for example, choosing from a miscellaneous collection
one or two pictures which they liked and then selecting
colour schemes, wall-papers, fabrics, pottery, glass and
furniture that would go with them in an imaginary
room. Or, again, watching three or so artists, with
distinctive styles, painting simultaneously from the same
group of objects, seeing how their vision varied and
evolved, and being able to talk with them about what
they were doing and why.
At other times they were shown different techniques,
seeing for themselves how an etching process may lead
to effects quite different from those achieved with oils
or water-colours. Some notions of the interrelations in
the arts were expounded by having them choose a small
collection of pictures and then select a programme of
records which would be in harmony with them. A
similar idea lay behind those occasions when they were
asked to mime scenes, in a kind of charade, which
derived their chief motive or character from a given
painting.
Even if all this sounds like elaborate parlour games,

this was one of the times when the ends justified the
means. The fact that these courses were not conducted
on a high level of aesthetic and philosophical discussion,
but involved the participants in experiences which they
could carry through at an ordinary level of activity
without any special technical or intellectual knowledge,
was the reason why a door was opened for them on a
world of the senses of which they might otherwise have
remained ignorant all their lives.
Something of the same kind was true of a civilian art
club, in which the pace was more leisurely than with
the army courses and the activities were more spontane-
ously evolved by the members themselves.
Although there were various kinds of practising artists
in the group, most of the people came because"they
knew nothing about art"but wanted to, and did not
quite know how to go about it. They arranged many
of the types of event, such as lectures, debates, exhibitions
and forum discussions, which are usually organized by
groups of this kind. They also did more imaginative things.
Sometimes each of the members brought two objects
from their homes, one that they thought was aesthetically
good and one they regarded as artistically bad. These
they showed and gave a brief statement on the reasons
for their choices. In this way they were obliged not
only to clarify their own ideas and express them
succinctly, but to do ; 0 publicly.
Another time, in a variation on the conventional
formula of the debate, the theme was presented in
dramatic form, in period costume. Victorian taste was
put on trial. Counsel for prosecution and defence
produced, in court, documentation, material and evidence
and witnesses, the last including some distinguished
foreigners, notably from France and the Orient. Victoria
and Albert were sub-poenaed to appear in person. After
due trial before the learned judge of aesthetic law, the
accused was found guilty, with a recommendation to
mercy.
To the solemn pundits of aesthetics and pedagogy it
may seem that this is perilously near to being a frivolous
approach to the serious business of adult education.
But adults learn, as do children, much better and more
readily through creative play than by pedantic
application.
Though the spirit of such clubs can be gay and
sociable, the underlying purpose is a serious one, to
arouse people from an aesthetic lethargy and cultural
unawareness, to help them not only to look but to see,
not merely to listen but to hear.
Creative expression and appreciation are necessary for
"The Twe ! ve"by an 11-year-old chill, Germany
everyone as forms of healthy personal experience.
Whether it be world-famed men or the butcher, baker
and candlestickmaker, Winston Churchill or the Douanier
Rousseau, they meet on common ground in finding
through the positive channels of aesthetic creation,
release from high-powered decisions and routine
existence.
The true arguments then in favour of more adult art
education are those which lay emphasis on the health
in art, on the value of creating in all kinds of communi-
ties, groups of people who are aware of the virtue in art.
They should act as the reconcilers and vivifiers in the
community. Though their art resources may be initially
limited they can help to increase them. Many places
are completely lacking in public collections of original
works of art.
In those countries where the standards of education
are low, where new programmes of basic education are
being promoted, sometimes with potential dangers to
traditional forms of arts and crafts, there is a sheer
necessity to encourage the people themselves to retain
and develop their natural, intuitive modes of artistic
expression. The right to enjoy the arts is an abstraction
unless people themselves can claim it and give it a
tangible reality.

ART EDUCATION
IS AS OLD
AS HISTORY
by Pierro Bargellini
Writer and art critic, Florence, Italy
WHENEVER I hear anyone speak-most
often, it must be admitted in
derogatory terms-of what are
known as picture-stories or strip-cartoons with
balloon-captions, my thoughts turn immediately
to the man who has been called the father
of modern painting-Giotto.
After all, are not the great series of
paintings at Assisi, Padua or Florence
precisely this-picture-stories designed for
the people of the fourteenth century ? Take
a close look at the individual pictures and
you will see, inserted, verses from the evan-
gelists or excerpts from the lives of the saints,
though the painted matter will always far
outweigh the written texts.
The comic artist Buffaimacco, the hero of
some of Boccacio's stories, suggested to a less
gifted colleague the device of making written
words issue from the mouths of drawn
characters. He, therefore, seems to have been
the first to hit on the idea of the"balloon",
now so widely used.
None of this would have come to pass had
not the Franciscans of the Middle Ages used
art, deliberately and methodically, as a means
of educating man, the eternal child. Church
paintings were known as the"poor man's
Bible"-the Bible of the indigent and ignor-
ant, the illiterate masses, to whom the true
faith was offered not through the written word,
but through pictures which, as any teacher
knows, make 0 direct appeal to the imagin-
ation and the emotion.
I have quoted this special and particularly
interesting stae in the history of art because
it illustrates, vividty, the use of art as a
means of education.
All societies, directly or indirectly, de-
liberately or involuntarily, have to some extent
used art for educational purposes.
One relatively recent example of obviously
educational art was that of the Romantic
movement in the nineteenth century.) It
evoked the glories of the past in order to
cause the various peoples to respond to the
ideal of freedom, in opposition to the despotic
governments of the day ; it recalled historical
examples of heroism, and of fortune good or
bad, so as to kindle in the hearts of men the
fire of patriotism and independence.
Thus we had the historical novel, the
historical melodrama and the historical
picture. We had, too, the historical statue.
Statuary in the Middle Ages was exclusively
religious and symbolical ; in Renaissance times
it was primarily mythological ; in the eighteenth
century it was vaguely idyllic and decorative.
It was not until the nineteenth century that
it became commemorative.
This was the signal for monuments to
national heroes and geniuses to be erected in
every public square. Such monuments served
as examples. They were historical reminders
to the people, of the civic virtues of those who
had rendered distinguished service to a city
or civilization. They were, therefore, historical
documents, somewhat idealized, designed to
provide education in citizenship and patriotism.
Romanticism, with its emphasis on history,
exercized a deep influence on the average
citizen of a nation ; it crystallized national
feeling in the new middleclass society which
was born of the French Revolution.
It was precisely in this middleclass society,
however, that the "crisis in art" shortly
afterwards occurred. Romanticism, having
effectively proclaimed certain national and

two Egyptian boys. The first of these young artists is aged 14. the second is 15.
* Languages : What is the best age at
which to begin the study of foreign
languages ? Should two or more lan-
guages be learned simultaneously ?
These and a host of other important
problems were discussed by some
70 language teachers and experts from
all parts of the world at a Unesco-
sponsored seminar on modern languages
which began in Ceylon in August.
Among other subjects considered : how
language teaching can better be used to
further understanding of other peoples ;
the latest techniques in teaching lan-
guages in primary and secondary
schools, and universities ; problems in
countries with more than one official
language. (This subject will be dis-
cussed in detail in a forthcoming issue
of the COURIER).
* Deserts : A display prepared jointly
by Unesco, the World Health Organiz-
ation, the Food and Agriculture Orga-
nization and the International Labour
Office on the scientific work of these
Agendes on problems of the world arid
zones is a feature of the large exhibition
"The Conquest of the Desert"which is
being held at Jerusalem from 22 Sep-
tember to 14 October.
* Fellowships : During the past year,
ten students (average age 14) from the
Fezzan desert, the most distant pro-
vince of the new Libyan Kingdom have
been studying elementary and technical
subjects in a specially organized course
in Tlemcen and Biskrah, Algeria,
through the Unesco Technical Assis-
tance programme and with the co-
operation of the French Government.
The students are probably the youngest
group currently being trained under the
Unesco Technical Assistance pro-
gramme.
* Education : How education helped to
transform a Mexican Tarascan Indian
village is described in"New Horizons
at Tzentzenhuaro", an illustrated booklet
published by Unesco. The booklet
reviews more than a year's work by the
Regional Fundamental Education Centre
at Patzcuaro, Mexico, which is operated
jointly by Unesco, the Organization of
American States. and the Mexican
Government. (Obtainable shortly in
English, French or Spanish from Unesco
Sales Agents, price : 2'5 cents ; 1/6d ;
75 frs.)
* Films : How films, film strips and
other visual aids can be used most
effectively in fundamental education was
discussed last month at a Unesco spon-
sored international meeting in Messina,
Italy. Specialists studied the application
of visual aids in relation to agriculture
and forestry, health and hygiene,

### 70564: Art education is as old as history
COURIER OCTOBER 1953. Page 15
THE UNDERGROUND SPIRITS.....-..............,
Children in the school at Riggisberg, Switzerland, were talking about some earthquake shocks that
had been felt in the Canton of Valais. One 9-year-old child suggested that they were caused by
underground spirits. This is how he depicted the spirits in a painting. Having four arms, the chief spirit (centre) was able to produce the most violent shocks.
civic principles, settled down quietly in the
complacency of a society satisfied with the
ideals which it had attained, and which
coincided perfectly with its own interests.
Bourgeois civilization of the second half of
the nineteenth century is symbolized in the
various arts. Architecturally, by the little villa
on the outskirts of the town, and sculpturally
by the small terracotta lions or dogs
"guarding"the little gardens and squatting on
the pillars of the gate. In painting, by family
portraits or naturalistic landscapes, to adorn
the modest drawing-room, in music, by the
ballad, and in literature, by the sentimental
short story.
Can it be said that this type of art had any
educational value ? In fact it had, though on
a less exalted plane. The art of bourgeois
society was designed to help form the
character of the'"perfect gentleman"and the
outlook of the'''well-bred lady of good
family".
However, artists instinctively and almost
unconsciously, rebel against such a humdrum,
not to say paltry task. Beneath the
apparently contented existence of the middle
classes, they sense discontent with a life bereft
of great ideals-and they suffer the tragedy
of virtue devoid of heroism.
They then become rebels, bohemians, social
outcasts. They proclaim the famous doctrine
of"`art for art's sake". They deny that art
has any educational purpose at all.., Art",
they say,'''has no function ; art is a function."
As a matter of fact, it is not so much the
artists who say this as the theorists and critics,
who, arguing on the premises of subjectivity,
refuse to admit that art has a purpose over
and above itself. Their error consists in the
belief that the educational purpose of art is
something which is external to the actual work
of art, whereas, inreatity, it<stheworkofart
itself ; the work, as such, cannot fail to have
an educational effect.
Thus even the art of the bohemian, the
decadent or the outcast is educational, be-
cause it denotes suffering, sin, anguish, a
search for supra-realistic truth. It is, to use
a current term,'''disturbing art"-an alarm
bell of which society should take heed.
In recent times, many social and political
programmes have been drawn up in which art
was assigned an educational purpose, but since
they all more or less partook of propaganda,
they failed both artistically and educationally.
I am discussing, of course, modern art, the
art which makes or should make immediate
impression on the adult mind. Some people
believe that a certain measure of education
can be achieved through a study of the arts
of antiquity. I doubt it. The teacher must
always be contemporaneous with the pupil.
Plato, for instance, can be studied but we
shall always need a commentator to render
him"actual" ; hence there must always be a
living bridge between past and present.
Ancient culture and art can, however,
recover their educational power if they are
taken as indicative of some contemporary
trend. The Greeks, for example, were evoked
by illuminism in the light of a specifically
rational approach. The Pre-Raphaelite move-
ment was especially fortunate in the prevailing
romantic mood ; and Baroque art, after suffer-
ing a total puritanical condemnation is now
undergoing a re-evaluation as the expression
of a world at once fantastic and conscience-
ridden, similar in many ways to the world of
today.
Ancient art no longer lives of itself alone ;
it is continually being re-absorbed into life
and evaluated through a spiritual process
which endows it with a contemporary quality,
therefore making it actual.
It may seem to the superficial observer that
the discovery of certain works of art has been
responsible for forming certain tastes. The
contrary is true. It is the emergence of
certain tastes that has led to the discovery
of the works.
What is important, therefore, is the spirit of
actuality which animates art. Art never
precedes a spiritual trend ; it follows it and
communicates it to the general public. One
thing only, therefore, is essential f art is to
have an educational function, and that is that
mankind, or at least a given society, should
identify itself unreservedly with a form of
truth from which something can be learned-
to which human conscience and will can
sincerely subscribe.
handicrafts, home economics and voca-
tional training. More than 200 films
and as many film strips were shown
and were analysed for their usefulness
in this work.
* Students : The Japanese National
Commission for Unesco was not yet one
year old when it announced recently
that there are already one hundred and
twelve Unesco co-operative associations
and one hundred Unesco student clubs
functioning in the country. Unesco co-
operative associations are responsible
for the steady growth of"Unesco
Schools"in Japan, where children get
free courses in drawing, music, dancing
and languages.
* Workers : During recent months
Unesco's workers'group travel grant
project has enabled some 44 groups
totalling over 800 workers from 12 Euro-
pean countries to visit, their colleages
in other countries for periods of study
of from 2 to 3 weeks duration. The
following'trades and occupations were
represented in this year's scheme :
building and wood workers, land wor-
kers, textile workers, bakery workers,
shipyard engineer and metal workers,
food and drink workers, train conduc-
tors, paper workers, police, commercial
and clerical workers, firemen and postal
workers and co-operative employees.
* Libraries : West African librarians
have founded the first West Africa
Library Association in which are repre-
sented Nigeria, the Gold Coast, Sierra
Leone and Liberia. This was one of
the results of the Unesco Seminar on
the Development of Public Libraries in
Africa, held at University College, Iba-
dan, Nigeria, in August.
* Medical : Unesco and the World
Health Organization have just issued a
new publication listing the four thou-
sand medical periodicals currently being
published in ninety-four countries and
territories. This publication is intended
to help specialists in medical document-
ation and scientific research.
* Geophysics : The Pakistan Govern-
ment has begun construction of a
magnetic observatory in Quetta, five
hundred miles north of Karachi. Mea-
surements taken there of overall
changes in the earth's magnetic force
will be used as a basis of comparison,
so that field observers prospecting the
region for mineral resources can check
their findings The observatory will be
part of a new geophysical research
centre at Quetta. A Unesco technical
assistance team has been helping in the
project.
* Oceanography : Following on its
comprehensive scientific study of the
arid zones of the earth with a view to
increasing their productivity and
improving the conditions of living
among their populations, the Depart-
ment of Natural Sciences of Unesco is
now embarking on a similar study of
the oceanography and the plant and
animal resources of the sea. The first
discussion of the programme will be
held during the Pacific Science Congress
at Manila on 16 to 28 November.
* Science : The first series of 80 work-
shop designs of"blueprints"for the
construction of scientific apparatus for
schools was exhibited, with finished
models, to a working party on small
industries of the Economic Commission
for Asia and the Far East at Bangkok,
Thailand, on 18 September. The designs
were prepared by Unesco to enable non-
industrial countries to equip their
schools for modern science instruction
with a minimum of foreign purchases,
by manufacturing apparatus either in
small industrial machine shops or in
vocational schools.
* Ancient paintings : With the approval
of the Governments of India and Egypt,
Unesco has arranged with the New York
Graphic Society, one of the leading
publishers of art reproductions, for the
publication of colour reproductions of
the ancient paintings at Ajanta (India)
and in the Valley of the Kings (Egypt).
* Science Exhibition : The Unesco trav-
elling scientific exhibit on"Our Senses
and our Knowledge of the World"has
completed its tour of Japan where it
was seen by 120, 000 persons in Tokyo,
Morioka and Fujuoka. It has previously
been shown to 380, 000 persons in
Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia,
Hong-Kong and Manila.
* Fellowships : A group of five Liberians
who are now studying teacher training
and the teaching of science in New
Zealand, are the first from their country
to go as students to this South Pacific
country. The Liberians are undergoing
special training in connection with
Unesco's Technical Assistance Programme
to develop staff for the Faculties of the
University of Monrovia and the Liberian
Teacher Training College.
* Korean Schools : A scheme to help the
rehabilitation of Korean schools recently
went into operation at United Nations
Headquarters, New York, with the open-
ing of an exhibit and a counter for the
sale of Unesco Gift Coupons. People
purchasing gift coupons can send them
to Korea where they are used to buy
school and laboratory equipment and
visual aids.

### 70566: Looking at life with the eyes of a child
LOOKING AT LIFE WITH
THE EYES OF A CHilD
by Henri Matisse
CREATION is the artist's true function ; where there is no creation
there is no art. But it would be a mistake to ascribe this crea-
tive power to an inborn talent. In art, the genuine creator is
not just a gifted being, but a man'who has succeeded in
arranging, for their appointed end, a complex of activities, of which
the work of art is the outcome.
Thus, for the
artist creation be-
gins with vision.
To see is itself a
creative operation,
requiring an effort.
Everything that we
see in our daily life
is more or less dis-
torted by acquired
habits, and this is
perhaps more evi-
dent in an age like
ours when the cin-
ema posters and
magazines present
us every day with
a flood of ready-
made images
which are to the
eye what prejudi-
ces are to the mind.
The effort needed
to see things with-
out distortion takes
something very like
courage ; and this
courage is essential
to the artist, who
has to look at every-
thing as though
he saw it for the
first time : he has to
look at life as he
did'when he was a
child and, if he lo-
ses that faculty, he
cannot express
himself in an ori-
ginal, that is, a per-
sonal way.
To take an exam-
ple. Nothing, I
think, is more dif-
ficult for a true
painter than two
paint a rose, becau-
se, before he can do
so, he has first to
forget all the roses
that were ever
painted. I h a v e
often asked visitors
who came to see
me at Vence whe-
ther they had noti-
ced the thistles by
the side of the road.
Nobody had seen
them ; they would
all have recognized
the leaf of an
acanthus on a Co-
rinthian capital, but
the memory of the
capital prevented
them from seeing
the thistle in nature.
The first step to-
wards creation is to
see everything as it
Thus a work of art is the climax of a long work of preparation.
The artist takes from his surroundings everything that can nourish
his internal vision, either directly, when the object he is drawing is
to appear in his composition, or by analogy. In this way he puts
himself into a position where he can create. He enriches himself
internally with all the forms he has mastered and which he will one
aay set to a new
rhythm.
It is in the ex-
pression of this
rhythm that the
artist's work beco-
mes really creative.
To achieve it, he
will have to sift
rather than accu-
mulate details, se-
lecting for exam-
ple, from all possi-
ble combinations,
the line that expres-
ses most and gives
life to the drawing ;
he will have to
seek the equivalent
terms by which the
facts of nature are
transposed into art.
In mv"Still Life
with Magnolia", I
painted a green
marble table red ;
in another place I
had to use black to
suggest the reflec-
tion of the sun on
the sea ; all these
transpositions were
not in the least
matters of chance
or whim, but were
the result of a se-
ries of investiga-
tions, following
which these colours
seemed to me to be
necessary, because
of their relation to
the rest of the com-
position, in order
to give the impres-
sion I wanted. Co-
lours and lines are
forces, and the se-
cret of creation lies
in the play and ba-
lance of those for-
ces.
In the chapel at
Vence, which is the
outcome of earlier
researches of mine,
I have tried to
achieve that balan-
ce of forces ; the
blues, greens and
yellows of the
windows compose
a light within the
chapel, which is not
strictly any of the
colours used, but is
the living product
of their mutual
blending ; this light
made up of colours
is intended to play
"Freedom of expression, freedom in the choice of subject, composition and colours, and in the tempo of
work. The child must follow his own thought, and he will find an original form in which to express it acc-
ording to his passion and his enthusiasm. In painting, as nowhere else to such an extent, the chi ! d is alone
with himself."-Arno Stern, Director of L'Academie du Jeudi, Paris. (Photo copyright Denise Colomb.)
upon the white and black-stencilled surface of the wall facing the
windows, on which the lines are purposely set wide apart. The
contrast allows me to give the light its maximum vitalizing
value, to make it the essential element, colouring, warming and
animating the whole structure, to which it is desired to give an
impression of boundless space despite its small dimensions.
Throughout the chapel, every line and every detail contributes to
that impression.
That is the sense, so it seems to me, in which art may be said to
imitate nature, namely, by the life that the creative worker infuses
into the work of art. The work will then appear as fertile and as
possessed of the same power to thrill, the same resplendent beauty
as we find in works of nature.
Great love is needed to achieve this effect, a love capable of
inspiring and sustaining that patient striving towards truth, that
glowing warmth and that analytic profundity that accompany the
birth of any work of art. But is not love the origin of all creation ?
(Text recorded by RÃ©gine Pel'llolld.)
really is, and that demands a constant effort. To create is to express
what we have within ourselves. Every genuine creative effort comes
from within. \Ve have also to nourish our feeling, and we can do so
only with materials derived from the world about us. This is the
process whereby the artist incorporates and gradually assimilates
the external world within himself, until the object of his drawing
has become like a part of his being, until he has it within him and
can project it on to the canvas as his own creation.
When I paint a portrait, I come back again and again to
my sketch and every time it is a new portrait that I am painting :
not one that I am improving, but a quite different one that I am
beginning over again ; and every time I extract from the same
person a different being.
In order to make my study more complete, I have often had
recourse to photographs of the same person at different ages ; the
final portrait may show that person younger or under a different
aspect from that'which he or she presents at the time of sitting,
and the reason is that that is the aspect : which seemed to me the
truest, the one which revealed most of the sitter's real personality.
