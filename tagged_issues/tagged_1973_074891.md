MEXICO
1 4 AOUT 1973
The most ancient among the fertility gods of the pre-Columbian peoples of Mexico was the rain-
god Tlaloc. He was highly revered by the Totonacs, whose civilization is known to have flourish¬
ed from the 7th to the 14th century on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico in what is now the
Mexican state of Veracruz. This recently-discovered Totonac earthenware statuette depicts
a warrior bearing the attributes of Tlaloc. The circles round the eyes represent clouds (in
the Totonac language "tlaloc" means cloud) and the nose and mouth are in the form of the
serpent-jaguar, symbolizing the powers of the earth. These attributes of Tlaloc stood for the
life-giving union of agriculture and the burgeoning earth. This statuette is now in the Jalapa
Museum, State of Veracruz, Mexico.

UNLOCKING THE SECRETS
OF TOMORROW'S WEATHER
The modern meteorologist now has
at his or her disposal a vast new
battery of instruments for observing
and predicting the weather, from radar
and rockets to computers and earth-
girdling satellites. Certain limited forms
of weather modification are already
being practised with success, warning
systems are taking some of the un¬
known out of hurricanes, and forecast¬
ing is reaching new standards of pre¬
cision. Full mastery of the weather is
still a dream, but mankind has begun
to forge the key that will unlock the
secrets of tomorrow's weather.

The 100th anniversary of the
U.N. World Meteorological Organization
marks the transformation of the study
of the weather into a revolutionary
new science on a planetary scale.

KAARE LANGLO of Norway is Deputy
Seeretary-General of the World Meteoro-
logical Organization. He has devoted his
entire scientific career to research in meteo¬
rology and was responsible for planning the
World Weather Watch to provide the first
truly global weather observation and data
system. He is a member of the Norwegian
Geophysical Society and the author of many
studies and papers on meteorology.
HE well-known saying that
"weather knows no frontiers" can be
said to have a special meaning in 1973
when meteorologists in all countries
of the world are celebrating 100 years
of organized international collabora¬
tion. Most people will probably
shrug their shoulders and say: "Yet
another centenary; what does it mean
to me?"
One of the purposes of this issue
is to demonstrate what a knowledge
of weather and climate means to every
one of us, and to every country in the
world in other words, it deals with
some of the global aspects of weather
and how the international co-operation
is organized after 100 years of
experience.
In recent years two apparently
unconnected events have had a revol¬
utionary impact on meteorology. One
of these is the emergence of high
speed electronic computers capable
of providing sufficiently rapid numeri¬
cal solutions to the mathematical
equations used to -describe atmo¬
spheric motions. Major advances in
numerical weather prediction have
resulted from this capability and will
doubtless continue.
The other noteworthy event is the

.t*.
development of the artificial earth
satellite. The launching of the first
weather satellite TIROS I in April 1960
surprisingly quickly showed that the
latest technological devices could be
used profitably by the meteorologist.
The potential value of this unique new
platform for global observations (see
later in this article) was no doubt one
of the prime reasons why the United
Nations General Assembly twenty
months later adopted a decision which
in meteorological circles is accorded
historic importance and which led to
the concept of the World Weather
Watch.
What is the World Weather Watch?
The main purpose of the World
Weather Watch (WWW) is to establish
a system by which all countries can
be provided with the weather data
and other information they need to
carry out their national obligations.
All nations participate actively in the
system both by receiving and by
transmitting weather information. In
addition, some countries have specific
international functions; thus there are
three World Meteorological Centres
(Washington, Moscow and Melbourne)
and 21 Regional Meteorological
Centres at which extensive use is
made of high speed electronic
computers.
These large meteorological centres
carry out numerical forecasts of the
future state of the atmosphere, making
use of physical laws expressed
in mathematical equations (called
"models"). In addition to the problem
of developing suitable "models", there
are three major conditions which must
be satisfied: C
We must know the actual state of
the entire atmosphere preferably at a
chosen hour (i.e. by making represen-

The ancient Goths of northern Europe believed that storm clouds were evil forces that
threatened their gods. Archers were used to repel these "invaders" as this 16th century
engraving published in Rome (below) shows. Today their action finds a much more
scientific echo in the rockets (right) fired at clouds to eliminate or reduce the destruc-
tiveness of hailstones, in recent years the study of the behaviour of hail has become
a special branch of research. Scientists have now succeeded In producing artificial hailstones
in the laboratory (above).

tative observations of temperature,
pressure, humidity, wind and so on)
and also the conditions at the lower
and upper boundaries of the atmo¬
sphere;
We must have the facilities to
process this vast quantity of obser¬
vational data very quickly in order
to reduce to a minimum the time delay
between the hour of observation and
the hour of issuing the forecast;
We must be able to transmit the
original observations rapidly to suit¬
able forecasting centres and to
distribute quickly the products of such
centres (weather analyses, prognoses,
forecasts, warnings, etc.) to their
users.
Until the present day the meteo¬
rologist has always had to accept a
compromise between what is scien¬
tifically desirable and what is econo¬
mically feasible in obtaining data from
a world-wide network of meteoro¬
logical observing stations.
For this reason it has only been
practical to sample the state of the
atmosphere at fixed hours by taking
point observations at a network of
stations on the surface of the earth
and upper air soundings up to say
30-40 km, by means of balloons carry¬
ing instruments transmitting meteoro¬
logical observations by radio.
The present world network of sur¬
face meteorological stations consists
roughly of about 9,000 stations on land,
to which should be added more than
6,000 ships which send observations
when plying the high seas. Soundings
are made from about 700 stations on
land and from a few stationary weather
ships in the North Atlantic and North
Pacific Oceans, supplemented by
observations from a number of aircraft.
It may seem that these sources
would provide a wealth of data and
that little more could be required.
It is of course true that the density
of observations over some of the
world's land area is already perfectly
adequate; but some three-quarters of
the surface of the globe is covered
by the oceans and a high proportion
of this vast area is far removed from
regular shipping routes.
Many land areas in developing
countries, particularly where the
climatic conditions are harsh, still
lack adequate observing networks.
The conditions at the boundaries of
the atmosphere are also insufficiently
known. This means that we do not
know the structure of the atmosphere
over most of our planet in sufficient
detail to understand the physical
processes taking place at any given
moment. Since current methods- of
weather forecasting start from a
knowledge of actual weather con¬
ditions the implications of this
ignorance are very serious.
The first condition for satisfactory
numerical weather prediction is there¬
fore not fulfilled. This is why one of
the first goals of WWW is to plan and
RING OF PROTECTIVE FIRE. Frost can cause incalculable damage to fruit and other crops
and is difficult and costly to combat. Above, a huge gas-burner, in the form of a pipe

develop a truly global observational
system. The most promising new
techniques to fill the major gaps are
meteorological satellites and the so-
called constant-level balloons, i.e.
relatively large balloons floating with
the wind at a constant pressure level
in the atmosphere which transmit their
observations by radio. Although not
a new technique one of the "secret
weapons" during the last world war
the automatic buoy weather station
should also be mentioned as a
promising supplementary means of
obtaining data from ocean areas.
Meteorological satellites have gone
through a remarkable development
during the past 13 years. In the
beginning they were only able to take
television pictures of cloud cover but
nevertheless proved immediately to be
of great practical value in detecting
and tracing the movements of one
of the most devastating phenomena in
the atmosphere: the tropical cyclone
(hurricane, typhoon). In September
1961 hurricane "Carla" was discovered
by Tiros 3 in time for 500,000 people
to be evacuated from the threatened
areas in Texas and Louisiana and only
46 lost their lives.
The introduction of the APT (Auto¬
matic Picture Transmission) System
was a great success. This system
permits any country to receive tele¬
vision pictures direct from the satellite
while it is passing overhead by means
of relatively simple equipment, and
today many hundreds of such
stations are in operation all over the
world and greatly assist in daily fore¬
casting for the public and aviation.
The same polar orbiting satellites as
used for these observations are also
able to measure the approximate verti-
cal temperature distribution over 7
cloudless areas. This technique is
still in its experimental stages but is
sufficiently advanced to create serious

discussion of the possibility of reduc¬
ing the number of the very expensive
Ocean Weather Ships now stationed
in the North Atlantic.
Other types of meteorological satel¬
lites are placed in stationary positions
over the equator. From a distance of
36,000 km. above the earth these
satellites watch the atmosphere per¬
manently and provide invaluable data,
particularly from tropical areas.
Constant-level balloons have been
tested with promising results in the
southern hemisphere. One such bal¬
loon circled the Antarctic continent
several times, and their average life¬
time is 100 days. It is also possible
to use satellites to collect observations
from a large number of constant-level
balloons and automatic buoy stations.
Unsung
heroes
who risked
their lives
to an International Cloud Atlas, and
so on.
On board several thousand mer¬
chant ships, officers are voluntarily
making similar observations at the
same standard times. These obser¬
vations must not only be made at
standard times but also regardless of
weather conditions, however severe
they may be. In raging snowstorms
or the sweltering tropical heat these
brave people do an exacting job for a
modest remuneration. No wonder the
word "heroes" has been used to
characterize them.
Some have given their lives for
meteorology. During a severe winter
storm at the Norwegian weather station
at Jan Mayen, the observer never
returned from a night visit to the
meteorological screen which was only
20 metres from the hut where he lived.
He must have lost his sense of direc¬
tion and was found the next day frozen
to death by the blizzard.
The second condition that must be
satisfied if weather forecasting is to
be improved is that data-processing
technology must provide a rapid means
of dealing with a very large amount
of global data.
An example will best explain the
reason for this condition and con¬
sequently the importance of modern
high-speed electronic computers to
meteorology. As already mentioned,
the basic mathematical equations
which govern the motions of the atmo¬
sphere have been known for many
years. It has, however, not yet been
possible to solve these equations in
their most general form and a number
of simplifications and assumptions
have had to be made.
In 1922 the English theoretician,
Lewis F. Richardson, devised an
approximate numerical solution to
these equations. The simple desk
calculator, which was all that was
available at that time, could not handle
the job. Richardson himself once
worked hard for six weeks to pro¬
duce an (unsuccessful) forecast for
12 hours; he estimated that 64,000 cal¬
culators would be necessary to keep
abreast of the changing weather
patterns.
The high-speed electronic computer
has made calculations of this magni¬
tude feasible and they are now used in
many countries to prepare or assist in
the preparation of the prognostic
weather maps which constitute the
basis on which forecasts are made.
The World Weather Watch is based
on the most modern techniques of data
processing. Each World Meteorologi¬
cal Centre prepares meteorological
charts for very large areas and distri¬
butes them promptly to other world,
regional and national meteorological
centres.
It is a basic principle of the World
Weather Watch that each national
meteorological centre has an obli¬
gation to collect and disseminate a
selection of weather data for use by
the rest of the world. In return, each
national meteorological centre receives
the global data it needs and has access
to those products (charts etc.) of the
world and regional centres which are
required to meet its national commit¬
ments.

IIT would be a great omis¬
sion to discuss the observing system
without mentioning the human effort in¬
volved. Consider the observers, those
unsung heroes who provide the basic
information on which the whole struc¬
ture of meteorology depends.
Their task is one of the most incon¬
venient and modestly paid jobs ima¬
ginable. Their duties require them to
be present at fixed hours of the day
and night, on Sundays and public
holidays as well as weekdays. They
must follow implicitly the procedures
laid down as the result of a hundred
years of international collaboration.
If we imagine that it is now time to
make the next observation, we can
visualize a silent army of some
8,000 to 10,000 people of all nationa¬
lities, in all climates from arctic to
tropical, making the same observations
at the same standard hour. They will
read thermometers placed in a special
white-painted screen, determine the
wind speed and direction over an
interval of ten minutes, estimate the
cloud cover and cloud type according
What the telegraph
hath wrought
HERE remains the third
condition that must be satisfied to im¬
prove weather forecasting efficient
telecommunications. A global telecom¬
munication network of higher speed
and greater efficiency, is an integral
part of the World Weather Watch plan.
Telecommunications are often called
the "life-blood" of meteorology. And
in this respect two events have had
enormous consequences for the devel¬
opment of weather forecasting. The
first was, of course, the invention of
the electric telegraph and its practical
introduction both in North America
and in Europe in the 1840s. The sec¬
ond was a disastrous storm which
caused heavy losses to the Anglo-
French fleet in the Black Sea on Nov¬
ember 14, 1854.
Some time after this storm a detailed
study was made to see whether it
could have been forecast had a
weather service based on telegraphed
reports then existed. Napoleon III,
who commissioned the study, received
an affirmative report from Leverrier,
and on the same day he gave the"
famous French astronomer orders to
organize a telegraphic weather ser¬
vice. This soon led to the establish¬
ment of official meteorological services
in a number of countries including
England in 1861, France in 1863 and
Norway in 1866.
International interest in meteorology
## [Page 9](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/074891engo.pdf#page=9) 0
### 51703: Unlocking the secrets of tomorrow's weather
was growing apace and important in¬
ternational conferences were held in
Brussels, in 1853, and in Leipzig, in
1872. The first world-wide effort, at
governmental level, to standardize and
improve international meteorological
activities was made a century ago
with the holding in Vienna of the first
International Meteorological Congress,
in 1873. From this Congress was
born the International Meteorological
Organization which, in 1951, was trans¬
formed into the present World
Meteorological Organization.
A world-wide telecommunication net
work for meteorological purposes has
been in existence for many years and
has been further developed under the
auspices of WMO. WWW provides
for a main trunk circuit interconnecting
the three World Meteorological Cen¬
tres and appropriate regional centres.
This trunk circuit will be of full duplex
type and will constitute a closed loop,
thus making it possible to transmit
simultaneously in opposite directions
around the earth.
In 1973 a large part of this circuit is
in-full operation. WWW also provides
for regional telecommunication net¬
works for the collection of observa¬
tional data from defined Darts of the
world and for its transmission to cen¬
tres on the main trunk circuit. These
networks are used for the distribution
of observation data, analyses and
prognoses from world and regional
centres to national centres.
Telecommunication satellites are
used to provide some of the links in
the global telecommunication system
such as Dakar-Paris and India-Aus¬
tralia.
Balloons, buoys and satellites
for longer-range forecasts
wHAT are the main trends in
meteorological research?
It should be clear from the above
description of WWW that an enormous
effort is being made to build up an
efficient world system for exchange
of the weather information used both
for routine daily weather services and
for research.
But our aims and the wishes of the
United Nations General Assembly go
beyond that. We would like to know
whether it is possible to forecast the
weather longer into the future, for say
two weeks, with reasonable accuracy
and we would like to know whether it
is possible by means of electronic
computers to predict future climatic
changes and to tell whether such
changes are natural or caused by
man's activities.
These, in brief, are the purposes of
the Global Atmospheric Research Pro¬
gramme (GARP), a joint undertaking
between WMO and the International
Council of Scientific Unions.
What do we need to do in order to
extend the forecasts further into the
future? Do we for instance need
measurements higher up in the atmo¬
sphere and do we need to take into
account the changes in ocean tem¬
peratures?
The first question is relatively simple.
The mass of air above say 30 km. is
so negligible that in most cases it
can be neglected in the "models" used
in the computer. Likewise it is not
necessary to take into account the
phenomena in the higher atmosphere
the ionosphere which is very im
portant for the transmission of radio-
waves but Is of no significance for
weather phenomena.
On the other hand, although the
temperature changes in the upper
levels of the ocean are much slower
than in the atmosphere and may be
neglected in short-range forecasting,
such temperature changes must be
taken into account when we attempt
to make forecasts for more than a
week.
The basic assumption behind GARP
is that the day-to-day changes in the
weather and also the larger fluctu¬
ations, such as the serious drought
periods now experienced in Africa,
are to a large extent controlled by
fluctuations in the so-called "general
circulation" of the atmosphere.
In order to improve our understand¬
ing of these processes and to produce
reliable forecasts for more than three
days we need to do two things:
design the best possible theoret¬
ical "models" of the atmosphere and
test them in the computer, and,
arrange "experiments" in the
atmosphere to provide the necessary
data for the design of such "models"
and test how good they are.
GARP therefore includes a number
of experiments: A GARP Atlantic Trop¬
ical Experiment (GATE) will study
specific tropical problems in 1974 (see
page 21); a Polar Experiment will study
the rôle of the Polar Regions; and the
Monsoon Experiment will study the
entire monsoon phenomenon from its
pre-onset to its full withdrawal.
Finally, a first Global Experiment is
planned for 1977 to seek overall ans¬
wers to the questions raised above.
As a by-product it is also hoped that
it will assist in determining the most
efficient and economical system of
global observations. To be success¬
ful, a much denser network than at
present provided by WWW will be
necessary.
The Global Experiment using the
whole atmosphere as its laboratory
calls for five geostationary satellites
which it is hoped will be provided by
U.S.A. (2), U.S.S.R., Japan and the
European Space Research Organi¬
zation (ESRO). In addition to the usual
polar orbiting satellites, the experiment
also requires a large number of con¬
stant level balloons and automatic buoy
stations to obtain better coverage from
the tropics and the Southern Hemi¬
sphere.
Vast amounts of data from these
sources will be fed into powerful
computers and it could be that the
year of the experiment 1977 will be
the year that meteorologists have been
waiting for during the past 100 years;
perhaps the atmosphere will finally
disclose some of its remaining secrets
and give the answers to at least some
of our questions.
The importance of these global
research efforts is well understood
both by the man in the street and by
governments. It is not necessary to
blow the great trumpet of alarm to
obtain support for these efforts since Q
it is obviously in the interest of man- ¡J
kind to know more about the behav¬
iour of the atmosphere and the future
of our climate.

'The most violent of all storms, a tornado

as a funnel-shaped cloud that conceals
winds of hundreds of kilometres an hour.
Tornadoes are born where air currents
of different temperature, density and
moisture collide and a mass of cold air
forces its way beneath warm moisture-
laden air. Though rarely more than a few
hundred metres wide and averaging
speeds of 40 km. an hour, they leave
a swathe of devastation wherever their
whirling tips touch down. Photos left and

A trump card
for developing nations
12
M EW subjects figure more
prominently in the daily news than the
imperative need to raise the standard
of living in developing countries.
Despite intensive efforts, it is common
knowledge that the gap between the
economics of developed and develop¬
ing countries is still widening.
To combat this trend ' the full
resources of science must be mobi¬
lized and this includes as a matter of
fundamental importance the appli¬
cation of meteorological knowledge to
economic development, whatever the
level attained in the country concerned.
It is no accident that the countries
with the most advanced economies are
also those making the most use of
meteorological advice.
In any programme of economic
development, attention must be given
to climate and weather. Over the
years it is climate that determines
natural vegetation, agricultural yield,
the abundance or lack of water
supplies and the suitability of different
areas for particular human activities.
Weather influences the demand for
power for industrial and domestic use,,
the economic operation of dams, the
choice of the best period for farming
activities, the safety and comfort of
transport services, and many other
facets of everyday life.
Economists recognize that adequate
meteorological information reduces
unnecessary expenditure, helps to
avoid the waste of natural resources
and manpower, and is vital to the
planning and implementation of devel¬
opment programmes.
The World Weather Watch will help
the developing nations to take part in
and grow with the scientific and tech¬
nological progress that is one of its
purposes. It will help to establish the
conditions necessary for effective land
use and water resource management.
The new global data expected from
the WWW will serve to speed up such
work. For instance meteorological
satellites offer many advantages to
developing countries; in particular the
APT system mentioned above permits
early warning of devastating storms.
In trying to raise the potential of
low-income countries, many govern¬
ments npw realize that the investment
of funds in meteorological work is an
essential preliminary to development
projects. For instance, the meteoro¬
logist and hydrometeorologist must
first acquire weather and water
records if they are to avoid the pitfall
of building dams at great expense in
areas receiving insufficient rainfall.
Surveys and feasibility studies,
sometimes sponsored by international
aid programmes, today provide econo¬
mic and technical data on soils, min¬
eral deposits, forests and water
resources; on power, transport and
communications possibilities, as well
as on agricultural and industrial
potential.
No country in the world, whatever
its size, can operate an effective
weather service without information
from neighbouring countries, and even,
for many purposes, from a whole hemi¬
sphere.
The first proposal to set up an inter¬
national fund to assist in establishing
special stations in remote areas or
telecommunications facilities goes as
far back as 1873 and, it was 90 years
before the idea was generally accept¬
able.
Today, in addition to participating
in the United Nations Development
Programme, WMO has established its
own voluntary assistance programme.
Through this programme developing
countries may request assistance to
establish any facility needed for WWW
and any country in a position to assist
may offer either equipment or services,
or both. Direct financial support is
also possible.
In total, during the last 20 years,
WMO has carried out 200 expert
missions, has granted 1,500 fellow¬
ships and has provided equipment and
organized training seminars worth
about 53 million dollars. In 1972
alone, the total of WMO's aid pro¬
grammes amounted to more than
10 million dollars.
The very success of technical co¬
operation in meteorology lies perhaps
in the fact that it is a truly reciprocal
process in which developing countries
are playing a full and indispensable
role.
This co-operation also extends to the
study of world-wide technical and
scientific problems which are handled
by eight technical commissions cover¬
ing all the major branches of meteo¬
rology and part of hydrology.
Did
you
know
that...?
w,HAT are the trends in the
application of meteorology to various
human activities?
Most people have the impression
that the most important activities of
meteorologists, in the sense of econo¬
mic benefit to the country, are the
general forecasts for the public and
the daily routine services to civil avia¬
tion. This is understandable but far
from the truth.
The benefits accruing from meteo¬
rological activities, such as special
forecasts for aviation, agriculture and
industry, are not always easy to cal¬
culate; is it possible, for instance, to
assess the value of human lives? In
spite of such difficulties, comprehen¬
sive studies have been made and it
has generally been concluded that the
savings to the national economy are
many times greater than the money
spent by a country on meteorology.
What kind of human activities
benefit most from meteorological ser¬
vices? They vary from country to
country but it will be a surprise to
many to see the list below which is
valid for a large developed country
and gives the activities in the order in
which they may benefit from available
meteorological services:
1) Fishing, 2) Agriculture, 3) Air
transport, 4) Forestry, 5) Construction,"
6) Land transport, 7) Water transport,
8) Energy production and distribution,
9) Merchandising, 10) Water supply
and control, 11) Communications, 12)
Recreation, 13) Manufacturing.
Here are some examples of the prac¬
tical applications of meteorology.
The effect of bad weather (strong

### 51703: Unlocking the secrets of tomorrow's weather
wind, frost, rain etc.) on industry is
obvious when the work takes place in
the open, though manufacturing pro¬
cesses and working conditions in
indoor industries are also influenced
by the weather. It is the meteorolo¬
gist's job to give advice which will
enable these effects to be reduced to
a minimum. It is estimated that the
annual loss to the United States con¬
struction industry due to weather
amounts to 3,000 million dollars.
In commerce the demand for certain
commodities is greatly affected by
weather conditions. The additional
load placed on power supplies in cold
spells is a good example of the fluctu¬
ating demand, and sales of food (ice¬
cream!) and clothing are also greatly
dependent on weather influences.
Many of the risks against which people
insure themselves or their property
are directly or indirectly related to the
weather. The rates of insurance are
often determined on the basis of climo-
tological statistics. Marine and crop
insurance are two obvious examples.
Almost every aspect of agriculture,
from the planning of land use to the
transportation of crops, calls for expert
meteorological advice. Areas pre¬
viously considered barren can today
be made productive thanks to a wider
understanding of the significant meteo-
roloqical factors involved in plant
growth.
The social consequences of applied
meteorology are seldom as plain as
they are in relation to food production.
It has often been stated that one half
of the world's population does not get
sufficient to eat to maintain normal
health. This horrifyinq figure presents
a challenge that is all the more des¬
perate because the explosive growth
of population of our times tends to
absorb every increase in production
without providing more food per head.
By the year 2000, we are told, there
will be two mouths to feed for every
one today. New sources of food must
be found and agricultural production
must reach unprecedented levels if
starvation is not to assume catastro¬
phic proportions.
In many ways our ability to respond
to this challenge depends to a con¬
siderable degree not only on opening
up new land for crops but also on
preventing the losses which now result
from climate and weather. A much
more detailed knowledge of the range
of climatic fluctuations in food-pro¬
ducing regions is necessary, as well
as a thorough understanding of atmo¬
spheric processes if damaging weather
conditions are to be predicted far
enough ahead.
The implementation of the World
Weather Watch should enable meteo¬
rologists to play a major part in the
food production campaign by enabling
them to give better scientific advice to
the agriculturalist. A stronger justi¬
fication than this would be difficult to
find.
The safe, efficient and regular oper
ation of air, sea and land transport
depends to a considerable extent on
the weather along the route. The
provision of accurate weather infor¬
mation and forecasts is accordingly of
prime importance to these operations.
The advent of high-flying jet aircraft
and the use of radar and other elec¬
tronic aids have not made this infor¬
mation redundant but have rather
created a demand for more highly
specialized advice.
The need to divert to an alternative
airport or the effects of clear air
turbulence in forcing airliners to reduce
altitude also have obvious financial
effects, and the coming introduction
of supersonic aircraft flying higher and
faster will make these problems more
critical. It is extremely doubtful
whether any radical improvement in
accuracy can be expected over many
of the world's air routes until more
information is available from them.
The planned global observational
system would furnish this information.
Meteorological information has many
other applications to transport,
affecting both its safety and the
economics of its operation. The
effects of even relatively minor delays
caused by fog, ice or snow extend
beyond the personal inconvenience
they cause to passengers, resulting
in a loss of working hours which can
hamper national economic growth.
The transport of perishable goods
by land or sea also depends on
specialized weather information. It
has been estimated that by 1975 the
total world freight costs for ocean
cargoes could amount to $15,000
million per year. If better routing
along minimum time paths, thus
reducing storm losses, fuel consump¬
tion and time at sea, could achieve
a reduction of only 1 per cent in these
costs, the annual savings would be
$150 million.
Who will be right
in the year 2000?
_ HROUGHOUT history man
has endeavoured to protect himself
against unfavourable climatic or wea¬
ther conditions. To a limited extent
he has succeeded. Tne heating or air-
conditioning of buildings, even the
wearing of clothes, are attempts to
modify the climate in which we must
work and play. Out of doors the
planting of trees or hedges, frost
protection, hail suppression and even
irrigation are all examples of the way
in which artificial influences have been
used to modify the natural climate.
At the same time man has inad¬
vertently created changes in local
climate by building large cities and
polluting the atmosphere by the
burning of fuels. For many years past
small-scale experiments have also
been carried out in local weather
modification such as fog dispersal or
cloud seeding to increase rainfall, but
the problem of large-scale weather
modification has not been solved.
It is believed that much more
attention will be given to these
questions in the future and in
particular it would be of enormous
importance if sound advice could be
given to governments on the possi¬
bilities of future climatic variations and
whether such variations are natural or
man-made.
The possibility of numerical forecasts
for longer periods, say up to two
weeks, was discussed under GARP
above 'and it is hoped that in 10 to
20 years time we shall know whether
the optimists or pessimists are right.
The potential economic value of
long range forecasting is not the same
for all activities and is not easy to
assess accurately. Aviation is not
much interested in such forecasts but
if farmers-, fuel producers, public
utilities, builders and water managers
were able to make economies of five
per cent only, the probable total
saving has been conservatively esti¬
mated at $5,000 million per year.
The use of natural resources is ..
another area where great progress is 1
not only possible but will be essentia! **
because of the increasing demands on
these resources.

TOMORROW'S WEATHER (Continued from page 13)
A global search
for new energy sources
and an all-out attack
on air and water pollution
w
16
ATER is life. Not only is it
vital to man's physical being but pract¬
ically nothing that he undertakes can
be carried out without its use in one
form or another. Weather records are
a prerequisite to an assessment of
water resources and to the national
planning of water use.
As a low-cost source of power it can
constitute a sound basis for agri¬
cultural and industrial growth. At both
the planning and operational stages,
the forecasting of weather and floods
is important if efficient and profitable
use is to be made of the available
resources. As an example, a one per
cent improvement in the spring flood
forecasting on the Peace River in
Canada will permit an annual saving
of one million dollars in the operation
of the huge power dam at Portage
Mountain.
The subsequent development of
river basins will aid irrigation and
drainage, flood control, soil conser-.
vation, navigation and fisheries as well
as the production of hydro-electric
power.
The international programmes in
hydrology developed jointly between
Unesco and WMO will ensure that full
attention will be give to these problems
in the future years.
The idea of using wind and solar
energy as power sources is by no
means new but is receiving increasing
attention partly because these re¬
sources are non-pollutant. An essen¬
tial prerequisite to future development
would be a detailed meteorological
survey of the distribution in both time
and space of wind and solar energy in
selected areas and taking into account
the possibilities of using other forms
of energy.
It will be necessary in the future to
pay more attention to the pollution of
the atmosphere.
The industrialization of the highly
developed countries of the world has
brought with it new problems for the
meteorologist. It is a well-known fact
that the burning of fossil fuels has
created changes in the local climate
of some areas and it is only In recent
years that active steps have been
taken to control the further pollution
of the' atmosphere.
The level of pollution in some places
has reached a point at which it has
serious social and economic con¬
sequences. The effect on the health
of the population of breathing impure
air is generally slow but nevertheless
lethal when meteorological conditions
inhibit the transport and dispersal of
the polluting agents. In the great
London smog of early December 1952
more than 4,000 people died, mainly
from bronchial or chest complaints
aggravated by the toxic air.
This example is, happily, one of
rare occurrence, and active measures
are being taken in many countries to
avoid similar disasters; we should not,
however, overlook the fact that the
annual toll of illness resulting from
pollution costs a great deal in terms
of man-hours. The long-term effects
of lower concentrations also constitute
a serious risk to the health of the
public.
A good deal more research into
the relationship between health and
pollution will be necessary before
these effects are fully understood.
Meanwhile, more rigorous legislation
to control the release of pollutants
will help to reduce the dangers, as
will the planning of towns to ensure
that there is adequate air movement
to remove pollution and disperse
contaminants.
Another vital problem for the future
is that the burning of fossil fuel is
believed to steadily increase the
amount of the natural gas carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere and that
industrial activities are changing the
amount of solid particles present in
the atmosphere. The possible impact
of these human activities on the future
climate is now receiving considerable
attention.
For the purpose of studying these
problems the WMO has established
a world-wide network of "background"
pollution stations which are placed far
away from industrial areas and which
are monitoring certain pollutants and
gases in the atmosphere. In the
future the measurements from these
stations will play a major rôle when
studying changes in climate.
M INALLY, one of tKe funda¬
mental problems for the future is the
clear trend towards a greater auto¬
mation of all meteorological work and
the increasing dependence on meteo¬
rological satellites to obtain global
observations. The automation of
observations, plotting of charts, cal¬
culation of future weather charts, etc.,
is a gradual process which changes
the work of many people but creates
no basic problems.
On the other hand, the greater
use of satellite observations could
mean that important global observing
facilities will be dependent on the
national plans of a few powerful
countries or group of countries. While
there is no reason to believe that this
powerful position of a few countries
will be misused in the future, it is most
likely that future satellite systems will
be based on a broader participation by
all benefiting countries through WMO,
the responsible international organi¬
zation.
There is no doubt that the World
Weather Watch and GARP will have
a great impact on future developments
in meteorology. For several gener¬
ations the countries of the world have
endeavoured to develop the science
of meteorology without having adequate
tools to do the job. We still do not
have all the tools necessary but at
least a great effort is now being made
to state in detail what is required in
terms of observations, equipment and
personnel.
It would be premature to try to
define the full consequences of WWW
and GARP, but a great deal will
obviously depend upon technological
developments now in hand and those
to come in the next few years. If
they prove capable of meeting the
complex demands placed upon them,
and if the spirit of international
collaboration continues to prosper and
grow, the realization of these great
scientific projects could be within our
grasp.
At least it is certain that the age-
old desire of mankind to harness the
forces of nature will continue to be
a driving force and the World Weather -
Watch and the Global Atmospheric
Research Programme are natural
steps in this direction. We may there¬
fore be optimistic about the out¬
come which will, inevitably, bring
changes affecting the way of life of
each one of us. >

IS THE EARTHS
CHANCING ?
For the past 30 years
the temperature of our planet
has been steadily dropping
by Hubert H. Lamb
CLIMATE
HUBERT H. LAMB of Great Britain is an international authority on the
long term processes of climatic change. He is director of the Climatic
Research Unit at the University of East Anglia (U.K.) and for many
years has been actively engaged in international research on climate,
in particular polar meteorology and the study of climatic fluctuations.
Among his many writings are "The Changing Climate" (1966) and,
most recently, "Climate: Present, Past and Future", a major study
of which Volume I, "Fundamentals and the Climate Now" appeared
last year (Methuen, London; Barnes and Noble, New York).
LT the beginning of this
century, and right up to the Second
World War, the accepted view in cli¬
matology was that, though there had
been significant changes of climate in
the geological past ice ages and
interglacial periods somewhat warmer
than now (not to mention the many
millions of years of the Earth's history
in warm geological eras with little or
no ice even at the poles) climate
was now essentially constant and had
been so for at least the last two thou¬
sand years.
Descriptions of the climates of Brit¬
ain, Germany and southern Russia by
Roman and Greek writers fn classical
times were so similar to the impress¬
ions of visitors from the Mediterranean
countries in modern times that they
seemed to prove the point : evidently
nobody stopped to think that the coun-

tries at both ends of the journey might
have been either colder or warmer
than now.
Granted the variations of weather
from one year to another produced
alternate times of ease and difficulty
and occasional disasters, but these
were taken to be just random variations
about the mean or, at most, the prod¬
uct of cycles of no more than a few
years or decades duration (and some¬
what capricious amplitude).
Hence, any table of climatic statistics
comprising the weather observations
of 30 years or more was thought to be
an adequate basis for future planning
(and even for the calculation, by refined
statistical methods, of such rare
hazards as the extreme flood or gust
of wind, or the severest frost, to be
expected once in 100, 200 or 500
years).
This view and these methods got
into the standard textbooks, and were
taught in schools and universities to
the generation now holding the posi¬
tions of responsibility in government
and industry in most countries. The
methods were, of course, sound
enough, provided the series of obser¬
vation data were really adequate to
the purpose in mind; but this has come
to be seriously questioned. In many
areas the methods are still in use,
pending a better understanding of cli¬
matic trends and changes.
The need for a reassessment has
become clear for a number of reasons.
Computations in the United States
from surface air temperature observa¬
tions all over the world show that from
the 1880s to some time after 1940 the
Earth's climate was becoming generally
warmer. The global warming over
those years amounted to about half a
degree Centigrade, but in the Arctic
it was much stronger and amounted to
several degrees between 1920 and
1940.
The ice on the Arctic seas decreased
in extent by about 10 per cent and
decreased in general thickness by
about one third. Glaciers in all parts
of the world were receding, opening
up new pastures and land for cultiva¬
tion, while the melt-water swelled the
flow of the mountain rivers in spring
and summer.
The greater warmth increased the
length of the growing season by two
to three weeks in England. The wild
flora and forests, the cultivation of
various crops, and the ranges of sea¬
sonal migration of birds and fish, all
spread to new regions under the in¬
creasingly genial conditions.
Mankind takes naturally to easier
conditions. Old habits of wearing
heavy clothing and laying in food
stocks for the winter in northern lands
were more and more given up, and
often unkindly attributed to the outmod¬
ed mental attitudes of the nineteenth
century, while the climatic improve¬
ment affecting most of the developed
countries in temperate (and higher nor¬
thern) latitudes passed unnoticed for
some time.
Once the climatic trend was noticed,
Man's major impact on the earth's
climate (through atmospheric pollu¬
tion, agriculture, deforestation, etc.)
is largely accidental, but deliberate
attempts at local weather modifi¬
cation date back to the early rain-
making experiments of the 1890s.
Today serious scientific attempts at
artificially inducing rain and snow
by cloud seeding are achieving a
certain limited success. Silver
Iodide crystals, salt particles, ammo¬
nium sulfate or other substances are
released into a cloud. Under favour¬
able conditions the tiny water drop¬
lets in the cloud collect round each
"seed" and fall to earth as rain or
snow. Right, artist's impression of

speculation began about the causes
and possible future consequences.
Some of the first scientific work on
the subject, published in the 1950s,
attributed the warming to Man's output
of carbon dioxide from the burning of
fossil fuels (coal, oil, etc.), which in¬
creased the quantity of this gas in
the atmosphere by almost 10 per cent
in the first half of this century.
Carbon dioxide is a minor constituent
of the atmosphere, only about three
parts in ten thousand by volume; but
its effects on the heating of the Earth
are important. It is much less trans¬
parent to the outgoing long-wave radi¬
ation from the Earth (which it there¬
fore traps and re-radiates, partly back
towards the Earth) than it is to the
incoming radiation from the sun (which
it allows to pass almost without loss).
The effect is therefore something
like that of a blanket or a glass-house,
holding in heat which the Earth has
received. It was calculated that a
doubling of the amount of carbon di¬
oxide in the atmosphere should in¬
crease the overall temperature of the
Earth by 3 to 4°C.
It soon became clear, however, that
carbon dioxide was not the whole story.
Despite increasing production of this
gas, with more and more industrializa-^
tion and the ever-increasing burning
of oil and other fuels, the temperature
trend reversed.
For the past 25 to 30 years the Earth
has been getting progressively cooler
again. Around 1960 the cooling was
particularly sharp. And there is by

### 51708: Is the earth's climate changing? For the past 30 years the temperature of our planet has been steadily dropping
now widespread evidence of a corres¬
ponding reverse in the ranges of birds
and fish and the success of crops and
forest trees near the poleward and
altitudinal limits.
Moreover, the longest temperature
records available in various northern
countries from the early eighteenth cen¬
tury (in England from the late seven¬
teenth century) showed that the prev¬
ious warming had a very long history,
traceable from the beginning of the
record through various shorter-term
ups and downs.
This meant that the warming began
before the industrial revolution and
could not be altogether attributable to
the effects of human activity.
Thus, quite recent climatic trends
have forced us to recognize that cli¬
matic changes and fluctuations are
forever going on, even in our own
times, and that we have to reckon
with changes brought about both by
natural causes and the actions of Man.
The decline of prevailing temperatures
since about 1945 appears to be the
longest-continued downward trend
since temperature records began.
In face of this and the many new
types of pollution put into the atmos¬
phere by industrial processes, bomb
tests, high-flying aircraft, rockets and
so on, the question of what we should
expect the climate to do next is often
asked but is not easily answered, and
the improvement of knowledge and
understanding has become an urgent
task.
Investigation readily shows that the
general wind circulation over the
globe undergoes continual variations
of vigour and to a certain extent of
its basic pattern. The variations range
from great predominance of the
"zonal" westerly and easterly cur¬
rents to considerable prominence of
"meridional" (southerly and northerly)
flows which are accompanied by sta¬
tionary "blocking anticyclones" at
certain longitudes straddling the mid¬
dle latitudes zone that is normally the
zone of prevailing westerlies.
HESE changes are the "me¬
chanism" by which climatic changes
are brought about, whatever the ulti¬
mate causes may be. And the effects
are by no means confined to tempera¬
ture and the extent of snow and ice.
Among the successive 10-year aver¬
ages of yearly precipitation in many
parts of the world, let us examine
some figures from about 1840 for
Barnaul (53° N 84° E) in the heart
of Asia.
The decades of global warming in
the early part of this century were
a time of abnormally maintained vigour
of the 'zonal wind circulation, and they
seem to have been marked by excep¬
tional transport of moisture-bearing
winds from the Atlantic all across
Europe and onwards as far as this
area of central Asia.
In previous deaades in the nine¬
teenth century and again after 1950,
the precipitation at Barnaul was less
by a substantial percentage. As the
average annual downput of rain and
snow beween 1900 and 1940, equi¬
valent to a rainfall of 482 mm. per
year, was just sufficient for agriculture
with careful management and some
artificial irrigation, the provision of
enough water in that region, as in other
parts of the world, in the long term
raises anxious problems.
With the rising population of Soviet
Central Asia, and increasing industrial
need for water as well, the authorities
have been obliged to consider divert¬
ing water from the great rivers of
Siberia which flow north to the Arctic
Ocean.
This proposal is one, however,
which demands a more exact under¬
standing of the large-scale processes
of climate than is so far within our
reach. If it is undertaken, it will have
to be attempted in very limited stages
and with a careful watch on possible
side-effects on the grandest scale.
This is because it is the water of
the Siberian rivers which largely pro¬
vides the ice-bearing layer of low
salinity on the surface of the Arctic
Ocean : if that ocean were converted
into a normal salt-water ocean with
an open surface free of ice, most of
the Arctic would be on average 10 to
20°C warmer than it now is (and over
30°C warmer in the winter time).
This change could alter the whole pat¬
tern of the wind circulation, and hence
the distribution of rainfall, over the
northern hemisphere.
A recent experiment (by R.L. New-
son, in 1973) with a mathematical
"model" of the atmospheric circulation
suggests that the winters would be¬
come colder over the northern hemi¬
sphere landmasses in middle latitudes.
And other studies (by a Soviet scien¬
tist, O.A. Drozdov, in 1966) have sug¬
gested, apparently in agreement with
this, that the rain and snow-bearing
cyclonic disturbances would be largely
diverted into the Arctic, leaving many
continental regions drier than before.
This problem of the water needed
in the arid lands in central Asia is one
point (and there may be others) at
which our understanding of climate
becomes involved with the human
population explosion and presents
mankind with a dilemma which may be
very hard to solve.

toms of climatic change as they occur
and wherever they are most clearly
seen.
And the Global Atmospheric Re¬
search Project (GARP, see article page
21) scheduled by WMO for the mid-
1970's should improve our understand¬
ing of the large-scale atmospheric
circulation and its interactions over
the whole globe.
But there is a great need also to
establish the facts of the past record
of climate in as much detail as pos¬
sible, to give climatology the longest
possible observation base for inves¬
tigating the natural climatic fluctuat¬
ions and their causes. Moreover, the
causes are known to go beyond
meteorology as ordinarily understood.
To identify them, and indeed to re¬
construct the facts of the climatic rec¬
ord in past centuries and millennia,
will ' entail an exciting collaboration
between many branches of science
and learning.
The measurements of the strength
of the incoming solar radiation avail¬
able from 1883 to recent years show
very clearly the effects of great
volcanic eruptions which put up per¬
sistent veils of dust into the high
atmosphere in 1883, 1888, 1902, 1912
and 1963.
From comparison of the tempera¬
tures and wind circulation patterns
prevailing in the years immediately
following these and other great vol¬
canic explosions in the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries, the effects upon
climate, though temporary, are seen
to be real and in some cases drastic.
B
20
'UT there has been a gradual
decline in strength of the solar beam
since 1945 which may have to be
attributed to the sun itself. There is
probably no need for undue alarm
about this, because similar changes
affecting climate and of the global
wind pattern appear to have occurred
many times before and what we are
witnessing may be a recurring fluc¬
tuation of the solar output, apparently
tending to repeat itself at about 200
or 400-year intervals. The effects
are, however, likely to be world-wide
and to pose awkward problems wher¬
ever we are exploiting climatic resour¬
ces (such as water or summer warmth)
to the limit.
Records exist of the number of
days each year from 1861 to 1970
when the general zonal current of the
westerly winds of middle latitudes has
swept across the British Isles. Par¬
ticularly noticeable are the high fre¬
quencies sustained between about
1902 and 1938, at the height of the
global warming, and the marked de¬
cline in recent years to previously
unrecorded low levels in 1968 and
1969 (and again in 1971).
Other records present the 600
year-long history of the frequency of
the south-westerly surface wind in
eastern England (based upon various
data, including an early weather diary
about 1340, and strictly daily obser¬
vations in London from 1669).
They broadly parallel the record of
westerly winds in the last hundred
years and seem to indicate a marked
decline of the westerlies, as in recent
years, recurring at about 200-year
intervals.
Apart from their possible ultimate
origin in a long-term fluctuation of the
solar energy available, linkages have
been demonstrated between the
changed patterns of the atmospheric
circulation and corresponding persist¬
ent anomalies in the circulation of the
oceans.
Because large volumes of warmer
or colder than normal sea water
cannot be reduced to normal at all
quickly, these have persistent effects
on the wind circulation which are
useful in forecasting.
Among the effects of the changes
of climate and the wind circulation in
recent years which have given cause
for concern are :
a renewed increase (especially
since 1961) of the Arctic sea ice,
which has created difficulties on the
northern sea routes in Soviet and
Canadian Arctic waters and has pro¬
duced some bad seasons on the coasts
of Iceland and Greenland.
a substantial rise, also- since 1961,
in the levels of the great lakes in
eastern equatorial Africa and, more
recently, of the Great Lakes of North
America;
some 200-year extremes of tem¬
perature in individual cold winters in
various parts of the northern hemi¬
sphere (and probably also in the
warmth of summer in 1972 in northern
European U.S.S.R. and Finland).
The most serious effects, however,
have probably been the long-continu¬
ed droughts and deficient rainfalls in
various parts of the world associated
with shifts of the world's anticyclone
belts.
Observations have shown changes
of prevailing atmospheric pressure
over the northern hemisphere in the
1950s and 1960's compared with the
averages of the first forty years of
the century. Pressure became higher,
and the situations therefore frequently
anticyclonic and drier, over most of
the Arctic, particularly the Arctic fringe
the change amounting to + 3 millibars
over part of Greenland.
A belt of lower pressure than before
in middle latitudes, particularly near
40°N (where the change was minus
2 millibars in some areas), marks a shift
of the main cyclonic disturbances and
rainfall towards lower latitudes than
before. (There was also some increase
of cyclonic disturbances in the inner
Arctic, near the pole.)
HE subtropical anticyclones
associated with the desert belt were
correspondingly displaced somewhat
towards the equator, and the equa¬
torial rainbelt seems to have been re¬
stricted in the range of its seasonal
migrations. In consequence, rainfall
increased in Africa close to the equa¬
tor, causing the lakes to rise, while
drought began to afflict places nearer
the fringe of the desert belt, no longer
reliably visited in summer by "equator¬
ial" rains.
Rainfall at eight places in northern
India, the Sudan and at 16 to 20°N in
west Africa averaged 45 per cent less
in the years 1968-72 than in the 1950's.
In all these areas people have been
driven from their homes by the con¬
tinued failure of the rains, and in the
Cape Verde Islands at the same lati¬
tude in the Atlantic an emergency was
declared in 1972 because of the last
five years of drought.
There are indications that corres¬
ponding shifts have taken place in
the anticyclone and cyclone belts of
the southern hemisphere and that the
droughts affecting Zambia, Rhodesia
and parts of the Transvaal in recent
years are essentially part of the same
phenomenon.
Since 1970 the area of increased
cyclonic disturbance in the inner
Arctic has grown in size, and the belt
of increased pressure and more anti-
cyclonic influence has expanded to
embrace most of the zone between 45
and 70°N, where droughts may also
be serious to the many densely popu¬
lated countries.
At the same time, the shifting posi¬
tions from month to month, and from
one year to the next, occupied by the
main anticyclone centres in this belt
have introduced an abnormal variability
of temperature and precipitation. A
similar development may explain the
sequence of droughts and floods in
different parts of Australia in 1972-3.
All these events have raised an
anxious demand for ultra-long-range
forecasting of climate, which calls for
intensified effort towards understand¬
ing of the atmosphere (and its inter¬
actions with the ocean) and for further
reconstruction of the facts of the past
climatic record.

unprecedented in its scale and
scientific significance.

single scientific programme and plan.
Over 3,500 persons will be engaged
in the programme of observations.
The results will be immediately trans¬
mitted back to Dakar (Senegal), where
an operations control centre for the
experiment is to be set up, to the
World Data Centres in Washington and
Moscow, and to Bracknell (U.K.), Paris
and Munich (German Fed. Rep.) as
well as to other cities. At these
centres, the data obtained during the
experiment will be processed by
computer.
When the experiment has been com¬
pleted, the results will be analysed
by dozens of research institutes, labo¬
ratories and universities in France, the
Fed. Rep. of Germany, U.S.S.R., U.S.,
U.K., Canada and other countries.
Hundreds of experts from different
countries are today working on the
scientific programmes and plans for
the full-scale launching of GATE in
June 1974. To co-ordinate this work,
the World Meteorological Organization
and the International Council of Scien¬
tific Unions have set up an Inter¬
national Scientific and Management
Group.
Between June and August 1972, in
preparation for GATE, the Soviet Union
carried out a one-nation "rehearsal"
of the experiment, with the partici¬
pation of six research vessels and an
aircraft. This expedition discovered a
number of previously unknown features
of the atmospheric processes in the
tropical Atlantic and also produced im¬
portant data which will be used in
planning the global experiment.
A
^TkN international rehearsal of
the tropical experiment is being held
(August 1 to 10, 1973), in the Western
Atlantic.
Two Soviet research vessels, "Aka-
demik Korolev" and "Ernest Krenkel",
the U.S. vessel "Researcher" and the
Mexican ship, "Cadete Virgilio Uribe"
will rendezvous at a point 20° northern
latitude and 60° western longitude to
carry out joint research. Their mission
is to make an "intercomparison test"
of various instruments and observation
systems to be used for measurement
in the stratosphere, atmosphere and
ocean, to work out uniform observation
methods and to get the necessary ex¬
perience in the organization of joint
océanographie work by vessels from
different countries.
In the first fortnight of August 1973,
whilst work continues at sea, the net¬
work of land-based stations and tele¬
communication links in Africa and
Latin America are being checked out.
The purpose of these two international
rehearsals in 1973 is not simply to
compare instruments and to work out
joint operations for the vessels involv¬
ed, but also to solve a certain number
of scientific problems.
It may be wondered why so much
attention is being paid to the very
early stages of preparation for GATE.
There are several reasons.
Firstly, there are likely to be many
more experiments of this kind which
help to solve practical scientific prob¬
lems but which are expensive and
difficult to organize.
Until recently, meteorological re¬
search in the oceans was mainly des¬
criptive in character or else was in¬
tended to solve specific problems of
atmospheric physics. Scientists, of
course, were well aware of the im¬
portance of the need for an integrated
approach to the problem, but the requi¬
site technical and material resources
for carrying out such international ex¬
periments were lacking.
For instance, in order to obtain a
mathematical description of the com¬
plex physical processes in the atmo¬
sphere which govern the weather,
with all their interrelationships, a large
number of simultaneous observations
have to be carried out, employing
satellites, aircraft and large numbers
of research vessels.
It is not a practical possibility for
any country, even the most economi¬
cally advanced, to carry out such re¬
search single-handed. The joint efforts
of many countries are needed, and
there must be a common interest in
the results of the experiment and mu¬
tual agreement to carry out the obser¬
vations simultaneously on the territory
of all the countries concerned and at
sea. Without powerful computers it
would be impossible to deal with the
flood of information produced by such
experiments.
Today, the practical conditions for
the success of the operation have been
fulfilled.
Secondly, and this is perhaps the
most important factor, GATE has at¬
tracted considerable attention because
of the need to find more reliable
methods for weather prediction, long-
range forecasts in particular.
The present rapid growth of industry
and agriculture gives increasing eco¬
nomic importance to long-term fore¬
casts, since early warning of such nat¬
ural disasters as droughts or severe
winter conditions, combined with mod¬
ern facilities for operational planning,
can considerably reduce the losses
which they cause and their other harm¬
ful consequences.
But if industry and farming are to be
planned on the basis of such forecasts,
the predictions have to be reliable.
Reliable forecasting methods can be
established using numerical models of
atmospheric circulation which describe
all the major factors in the state of
the atmosphere and its relationship
with the underlying surface of the land
and the oceans.
Such mathematical models as these
cannot be drawn up without a de¬
tailed study of the processes occurring
in the tropics. This is because the
surfaces of the land and the oceans
in that area store up a great part of
the solar energy which reaches the
earth. The processes taking place in
the tropics thus have a considerable
influence on atmospheric circulation
as a whole.
The research which is to be carried
out during GATE will provide vital ex¬
perimental material for a far-ranging
assessment of the processes occur¬
ring in this area and will help to ex¬
plain how and to what extent they
influence the weather and the climate
in other regions of the world.
M^ INALLY, some processes
such as convection (the upward move¬
ment of warm, moist air), evaporation
from the surface of the oceans, the
formation of cloud systems, etc., which
are of fundamental importance for the
atmosphere as a whole, are particu¬
larly marked in the tropical zone. By
investigating them there it will be
possible to discover the physical
mechanism which governs them more
quickly and more easily.
Until this physical mechanism is pro¬
perly understood, it will be impossible
to deal with such practical problems
as artificial rain-making or the use of
artificial means to reduce the destruc¬
tive force of tropical hurricanes. A
practical example can illustrate the
capital importance of solving these
problems.
Tropical hurricanes and the flooding
which accompanies them cause more
casualties and more damage than any
other natural disaster (for a general
article on typhoons and hurricanes see
page 52). It has been reckoned that
in the hundred years between 1870
and 1970, they caused on average
1,500 million dollars worth of damage
and more than 5,000 deaths per year.
Out of the world total, the countries
of Asia and the Far East suffered
losses to the tune of 950 million dol¬
lars a year, the countries of the Carib¬
bean and the United States about
400 million dollars and the countries
on the south-western shores of the
Indian Ocean about 46 million dollars.
The heaviest losses were suffered by
the economically developed coun¬
tries the United States and Japan
whose losses totalled about 1,000 mil¬
lion dollars a year more than 66 per
cent of the total.

### 51712: Operation "Gate", 35 countries assemble a scientific armada to study atmospheric phenomena in the tropical Atlantic
Automatic ocean weather buoys are impor¬
tant links In the World Weather Watch
meteorological network. Dozens of these
giant buoys are to be used in the forthcom¬
ing tropical Atlantic research project.
According to the secretariat for the
international Typhoon Committee, set
up under the auspices of the U.N.
Economic Commission for Asia and the
Far East and WMO, 22 countries in
Asia and the Far East during the per¬
iod 1961-1970 suffered damage ave¬
raging 930 million dollars a year from
hurricanes and typhoons. This figure
is equivalent to the total amount paid
out annually to these countries by the
International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development.
The losses caused by tropical hurri¬
canes are a heavy burden on the eco¬
nomies of many countries, particularly
the developing countries. Although
considerable progress has been made
in forecasting and in providing early
warnings of the approach of hurrica¬
nes, the losses suffered by many
countries at present total five per
cent, or even more of the national in¬
come.
In this connexion, it is interesting
to look at a breakdown of these losses
by years for countries with different
levels of economic development. Los¬
ses due to hurricanes in the United
States during the period 1915-1924
amounted on average to only 63 million
dollars. Thus in the last fifty years
the scale of these losses has increased
by 473 per cent, a yearly average in¬
crease of 9.5 per cent which is
about twice as high as the rate of
growth of national income. In the 25
years beginning in 1945, the cost of
damage caused by typhoons in Japan
increased from about 273 million to
600 million dollars a rate of growth
of about 6 per cent per annum.
In the Caribbean countries, the cost
of hurricane damage increased in the
course of ten years from 33,200,000 to
92,900,000 dollars, i.e. an increase of
18 per cent per annum, which is nearly
three times the rate of growth of the
national income. Similar trends are
noted in the Philippines, Taiwan and
other places.
The increasing cost of such damage
is due to intensive economic develop¬
ment in the areas affected by hurri¬
canes and typhoons, the main factor
being the rising cost of construction
and the growing number of technical
installations being built, and these are
reasons which will continue to hold
good in the future.
This means that unless radical solu¬
tions to the problems of tropical hurri
canes are found, the time will come
when the cost of damage will draw
level with the figure for the growth of
the national income in other words
cancelling out any progress.
To prevent such a situation from
arising, we must seek new ways of
dealing with the problem. In other
words, we must develop scientific
techniques for preventing hurricanes.
Such methods will undoubtedly be
found, along with methods for making
clouds shed their rain and techniques
for influencing other meteorological
phenomena, since many atmospheric
processes are of a similar physical
nature.
The GARP Atlantic Tropical Experi¬
ment is certain to produce numerous
observations which will throw much
light on the physical nature of atmo¬
spheric processes, in large and small
scale terms. This will mark a decisive
step in the development of effective
means of influencing such processes.
Since hitherto only a few ships have
usually taken part in ocean expeditions
to investigate the atmosphere and the
hydrosphere, the results obtained have
given only a very approximate idea of
atmospheric and < oceanic processes.
The forthcoming "tropical experiment,
however, will simultaneously cover the
whole tropical zone of the oceans and
the surrounding land areas of Africa
and Central America.
It will thus be possible to follow the
development of atmospheric processes
and the movement of atmospheric dis¬
turbances over land and sea alike, and
hence to determine on a large scale
the influence of the ocean on these
processes.
At the same time, 15 ships, a large
number of data buoys, more than ten
aircraft and several tethered balloons
will be concentrated in a smaller area
of more intensive observations in an
area covering about 800 by 800 km. to
the south of the Cape Verde Islands.
They will keep constant watch on the
atmosphere in this area when the most
interesting phenomena are occurring.
All this should provide material of fk_
unique value for the solution of present JA
and future problems of hydrometeoro- **
logy, and should pave the way for
many scientific discoveries.

u.'NLIKE someone in an¬

cannot bury his mistakes. They are
there for all to see and suffer: the
rain that drenches picnickers on a "fair

chill that leaves vacation resort oper¬

rooms empty. When such things
happen, the weatherman gets the
blame and his reputation suffers.
A great deal to change this image

punter inside information on a horse
race. Or it can try to manipulate
nature so that, in effect, our bettor
has a sure thing. The WMO gives us
an idea of how far we have come
towards foretelling and changing the
weather two of man's oldest dreams.
James McQuigg, an American re¬
search meteorologist and professor of
atmospheric science, produces a host
of examples to show how accurate
weather forecasts can pay off. Para¬
doxically, the more developed an eco¬
nomy, the more weather-dependent it
may be. The effects of nature's
whims are extremely expensive when
large capital investments are involved.
A good case is the routing of ships
across the North Atlantic. The cost
of producing a recommended route is
about that of running a medium-sized
tanker for half an hour. Since the
forecast may save from four to twelve
hours on a voyage, the shipowner gets
his money back eight to twenty^four
times over.
Ships eat up money in harbour. If
dockers are called out to unload deck
Cargo from a freighter in New York
harbour and rain starts to fall, they
cannot work safely. But they must be
paid a minimum which can amount to
$3,000 or $4,000 for one day. On
the other hand, it costs $5,000 a day
to keep a ship in dock with no one
unloading it. In New York harbour,
a good weatherman earns his pay.
He does on the Missouri River, too,
between Kansas City and St. Louis.
A river forecast centre in Kansas City
can predict river levels from one to
three days in advance. This is pre¬
cious information to skippers of tow-
boats hauling barges on the Missouri.
They cannot use memory and instinct
to get over snags and sandbars the
way Mark Twain and his fellow pilots
did a century ago.
When the Missouri is low, every
*ftNESCc>
extra inch of draught means more
cargo and a gain of $125 per barge
on the 400-kilometre run from Kansas
City to St. Louis. If the forecaster
can safely predict a rise of two feet
above minimum flow, then a towboat
can take half again as many barges.
As one might expect, farmers are
good customers for weather informat¬
ion. The more they modernize, the
more they need it. McQuigg tells us
the implications of the Green Revo¬
lution and the new varieties of crops
it has introduced
"Old locally-developed maize varie¬
ties in Kenya apparently had a broader
spectrum of genetic characteristics,
resulting in less uniform sowing-mat¬
urity requirements (and lower yields).

"In some areas, this resulted in a
nine-fold increase in yield."
On the Mississippi Delta in the
United States where cotton is king,
a different need arose. In the old
days when cotton was planted by
hand, it had to be replanted if a cold
snap struck. Then came mechaniza¬
tion and higher costs that made
replanting more expensive.
Meteorologists found that a cotton
grower could cut his risks if he knew
the actual soil temperature at planting
depth and then used the five-day tem¬
perature forecast for his region. Mc¬
Quigg estimates that farmers in south¬
east Missouri saved about $500,000
a year using information that cost
$25,000 to produce.
N
26
I EW techniques mean new
problems, particularly when animals
are kept indoors. The climatologist is
now called upon to assess the pros
and cons of air-conditioning dairy
cattle to see if higher yields are worth
the added cost (the answer, according
to McQuigg, varies from one place to
another).
Animals raised indoors are not as
tough as those that roam pastures or
woodland. So the meteorologist is
needed to make sure that weather
conditions will be right when pigs or
cattle are shipped to market or to
warn farmers of the onset of a humid
heat wave that can hurt their indoor
herds.
Wherever McQuigg pries with his
inquiring mind, he overturns some in¬
teresting stones. He tells us that the
construction industry would like to be
able to work all the year round in
cold latitudes, thereby getting a better
return on its capital (interest has to be
paid all the year round). Meteorology
must be able to say when the tem¬
perature will go down to freezing so
that the right precautions are taken
when concrete is poured.
In hot weather, precise short-range
forecasts are the answer to the elec¬
tric power industry's prayer in a coun¬
try such as the United States where
human beings, unlike cattle, want to
be air-conditioned no matter what the
price.
McQuigg cites a case: "One mid
west U.S. electric power company
serves an area with the demand for
power most sensitive to weather in the
summertime. The cost of providing
electric power, using a combination of
hydroelectric, steam and gas turbine
generators owned by the company
and electric power bought from other
companies, on a very warm humid
summer day is three to five times
higher than on a cool dry summer day.
Short-term weather forecasts are very
useful to the manager of this kind of
system."
The electric power industry also
needs long-term forecasts five to ten
years ahead so that it can plan how
to meet future energy needs without
saddling itself with expensive excess
capacity.
Meteorologists are in demand on the
marketplace. The clothing industry
may produce large numbers of bathing
suits only to hear customers clamour¬
ing for raincoats. In New York City,
it has been found that a warm Septem¬
ber will drive sales of women's winter
coats down to only 14 per cent of the
seasonal average. If September is
cool, sales will run to twice the
average.
When it comes to vacation and
leisure pastimes, meteorologists have
gone far beyond the stage of trying
to learn whether it will be a good day
for the beach. McQuigg tells how a
climatologist in the state of Michigan
was asked by two groups of business¬
men if certain sites would have
enough snow to warrant setting them
aside as recreation areas for snow¬
mobile enthusiasts.
Records showed that one site only
had from ten to twenty suitable days
per winter season so peace and quiet
prevailed there. But the probabilities
looked better for the other site and
it is now being developed.
EOPLE in the United Sta¬
tes can now go south for the skiing
thanks to the collaboration of meteo¬
rologists, businessmen and engineers
on the mountains of North Carolina.
At first, Albert V. Hardy, the state
climatologist, said that nature could
not supply enough snow for skiing and
what there was did not last long
enough.
Then engineers found that man-
made snow could be used and, said
Hardy, the outlook brightened. "Many
of the northern facing slopes have a
winter climate able to support a base
snows tends to help nature by cooling
of snow for extended periods. In
fact, the process tends to be self-per¬
petuating since a continuous supply of
the air around the area." Air-condi¬
tioned cattle and snow-cooled air...
Chilling a mountain is weather mod¬
ification, albeit on a very small scale.
The WMO has looked closely at the
possibility of changing the weather
over large areas and the benefits that
might be expected. L.L. Means sums
up progress in his report on economic
and social aspects of weather modifi¬
cation.
The benefits are huge when one
looks at the havoc that the weather
can wreak. Means states that in the
United States alone, hurricane damage
averages about $500 million a year,
hail damage amounts to more than
$300 million and the bill for forest
fires started by lightning is another
$100 million.
m OG delays cost domestic
airlines more than $75 million a year
and no one knows how much they
affect ground and water transportation.
Costs that can be directly identified
with hurricanes, hail, lightning and fog
run to around $1,000 million a year
in the United States alone.
The brightest prospects seem to lie
in airport fog dispersal. In the past,
a number of techniques have been
used. In particular, freezing fog has
been seeded with silver iodide or dry
ice pellets so that it precipitates out
as ice crystals. Warm fog is tougher.
Helicopters can blow it away with a
warm downwash from their rotors but
that only clears enough space to land
a helicopter. Heating the air with
open flames along a runway is costly
and dangerous to planes veering to
one side.
No method really worked until the
French got the idea of putting jet
engines underground at Orly Airport
outside Paris and using them to heat
the air. Means says this could be
"a significant breakthrough from both
the technical and economic view¬
points".
It comes at the right time. The

INDIA: A LEADING ROLE
IN WORLD
WEATHER RESEARCH
The Indian Meteorological Department, set up in 1875, is one
of the world's longest-established meteorological services.
During the last twenty years it has expanded dramatically.
1 954 saw the first storm detection radar installed at Calcutta
airport; in 1956 the Directorate of Radio- Meteorology
was established in New Delhi: and in 1962 the Northern
Hemisphere Exchange and Analysis Centre was set up, also
in New Delhi.
This expansion was given added impetus with the launching
in 1963 of the International Indian Ocean Expedition by
Unesco, the Scientific Committee for Ocean Research
(SCOR), and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).
An International Meteorological Centre was established
in Bombay to collect and process data acquired during th
Expedition. At the conclusion of the Expedition, in 1966,
the Centre was transferred to the city of Poona, south-east
of Bombay, to become the Indian Ocean and Southern
Hemisphere Analysis Centre.
Meanwhile, 1963 also saw the establishment at Poona of
a new Institute of Tropical Meteorology. Now an autono¬
mous body, the Institute is undertaking important research
on tropical and sub-tropical meteorology including the
study of monsoons, forecasts and warnings of floods and
tropical cyclones, medium-range forecasting for agricul¬
ture, etc.
While the development of meteorological services is of
vital national importance to India, the Indian Government
is making a very broad contribution to international meteo¬
rology. With the establishment in 1971 at New Delhi of a
Regional Meteorological Centre and a Regional Telecom¬
munications Hub of the World Weather Watch, the Indian
Meteorological Department is now one of the vital links in
the world's meteorological observation system.

INTER-CONTINENTAL DUST CLOUD
Scourge of the world's deserts and adjoining regions, sand and dust storms can attain peaks
of tremendous violence. Above, a mountain-high "wave" of sand raised by the wind streaks
across the Sahara, blotting out the sky and enveloping everything in its path. Storms such
as these cover enormous distances. In June and July 1969, the American satellite ATS III
tracked and photographed the extraordinary journey of a dust cloud across thousands of
kilometres from the Sahara across the Atlantic to Barbados in the Caribbean. Series of
photos on left are the actual images transmitted by satellite ; right, the same pictures show¬
ing the African continent and Caribbean area and the moving dust cloud. Not all the effects
of dust clouds on weather are known and satellite photographs are expected to throw new
light on these problems.

wide^bodied airbuses now being intro¬
duced carry so many passengers that,
according to one estimate, delays and
cancellations may cost twice as much
as in the past. Tests in the U.S. in
the winter of 1969-70 showed that it
cost $118,300 to clear fog at nine
cities while benefits amounted to
$339,970. With bigger planes and
better techniques it is expected that
this ratio will be considerably im¬
proved.
Operations on a much bigger scale
are being carried out to stop hail.
The world leader here appears to be
the Soviet Union. According to
Means, at least four Soviet programm¬
es are now serving nearly 2,500,000
hectares of farm land. He writes:
"Ice-nuclei (usually lead iodide) are
usually delivered directly into the
clouds at appropriate altitudes through
the use of artillery or rockets. Soviet
scientists have reported success in
all of these projects with reduction
in hail damage ranging from 50 to 90
per cent."
In Kenya, hail losses were reported
cut by 58 per cent over an area of
800 square miles where 40,000 acres
of tea are grown. The verdict, how¬
ever, is far from unanimous. Swiss
experiments "showed no significant
difference in duration, areal extent
or intensity of hail when it occurred
on seeded and unseeded days."
The Swiss report said hail actually
fell more often on seeded days which
also saw a 21 per cent increase in
average rainfall. In the United States,
hail-raisers found they were taken to
court because less rain fell after their
cloud-seeding.
Clouds are also seeded in attempts
to stop lightning from starting forest
fires. The U.S. Forest Service says
that its Skyfire experiment has reduc¬
ed lightning-lighted fires by up to 90
per cent in the seeded areas. Some
scientists query this figure and the
method is now being given a more
extensive test.
It would cost $50,000 to send air¬
craft up to seed a front of convection
cells likely to produce lightning as it
advanced across the Pacific North¬
west in the U.S., but it cost $11 million

to fight 124 lightning fires that struck
one forest in that area during eleven
days in 1971.
Even bigger money is involved when
the WMO report turns to the modifi¬
cation of hurricanes and typhoons.
This work is being carried on in the
United States under another impres¬
sive name, Project Stormfury. It aims
to seed hurricanes and thereby reduce
the intensity of their maximum winds.
The WMO report states: "In Hurri¬
cane Debbie (August 1969) data col¬
lected by aircraft showed that on suc¬
cessive runs extending over a period
of about three hours before the first
seeding until five or six hours after
the fifth seeding, the winds at 12,000
JULY 4, 1969
feet decreased about thirty per cent
on August 18.
"The storm re-intensified on August
19, starting about eight hours after
the last seeding on the 18th. On
August 20, Debbie was again seeded
five times. The maximum winds de¬
creased about fifteen per cent... It is
not known whether the decreases in
intensity... were caused by seeding or
by natural forces.
"More experiments are needed to
confirm the encouraging results of
seeding Debbie. Proposals have been
made to move the project to the
Pacific where opportunities to seed
typhoons would occur more often."
As noted earlier, hurricane damage
in the United States runs to $500 mil
lion a year, and an incalculable toll in
human lives is taken by the typhoons
that strike in the Bay of Bengal.
Means notes: "The costs of Storm-
fury experiments and research by
contrast are relatively low. If spend¬
ing continues during the next ten
years at the current annual rate, and
if at the end of ten years it is possible
to modify one hurricane such as
Camille (1969) sufficiently to reduce
the damage by ten per cent, that
reduction will amount to more than
ten times the costs over the ten-year
period."
He does remark, though, that hur- 7Q
ricane modification raises some eco¬
nomic and legal problems which are
easy to imagine. Anyone who could

MAKING THE WEATHER PAY OFF (Continued)
Rain-making stories with a happy ending
Rain-making stories with an unhappy ending
prove that cloud seeders brought a
hurricane down upon his head could
collect astronomical damages.
While the United States is alone in
hurricane modification research and
the Soviet Union suppresses hail on a
much greater scale than anyone else,
a number of countries have made an
attempt at "precipitation enhance¬
ment" a piece of jargon that the
meteorologist uses because it sounds
so much more respectable than "rain-
making".
One cannot blame him for trying
to get away from the old picture of
the medicine man beating a drum or
the quack scientist firing a popgun
at the sky. In the past, meteorologists
have always displayed great caution
when the issue of "rain-making"
arose. Now, according to the highly
respectable WMO, they are less sus¬
picious.
30
EANS describes a few
examples. One from Florida in the
United States is illustrative. "The ap¬
proach used 'dynamic seeding' which
involves massive doses of silver iodide
introduced into the top of cumulus
clouds by dropping pyrotechnic flares
from aircraft. Dynamic seeding is
directed toward producing large
growth of the cloud by releasing the
latent heat of freezing available in the
supercooled water content.
"Clouds seeded by suoh a method
are said to rain more because of in¬
creased cloud size and lifetime... Dy¬
namic seeding, if successful, is des¬
cribed as causing one or more cumu¬
lus congestus clouds to grow into
towering cumulonimbi which may
merge into a huge cumulonimbus
complex.
"It was noted that merged clouds
produced ten times more precipitation
than isolated clouds on the same day...
If optional rain enhancement is desir¬
ed, dynamic seeding should be used
deliberately to produce mergers.
"The main result reported of the
experiments and statistical analyses is
that the effect of dynamic seeding on
rainfall is large, positive and signifi¬
cant... The seeded clouds were report¬
ed to have produced more than three
times as much rain as the control
clouds."
the Sovi.et Union, WMO states,
scientists have found that precipita
tion could be increased from 13 to 18
per cent over the Ukraine in winter.
Results from two areas in Australia
showed increases in rainfall up to
300 kilometres downwind from the
area where the clouds were seeded.
The Australians have long adopted
a "show-me" attitude towards rain
enhancement. But now Means quotes
the results of a major experiment
in Tasmania: "In the determination of
the effects of cloud-seeding on the
rainfall over a hydroelectric catchment
area, it was concluded that rain was
increased by 10 per cent or 20 per
cent. It has been estimated that a
one per cent increase in this area
could be worth about $100,000 per
year."
One rain-making story with a happy
ending comes from the Philippines.
"The project was started in April 1970
after months of drought. In central
Luzon, the sugar-cane and other crops
were dying. By the time the project
was completed in June, the islands
were reported as verdant. The Phil¬
ippine Sugar Institute assembled in¬
formation and estimated the impact
on the economy. The value of net
gain in production was estimated at
$43 million. The cost of the project
was roughly $500,000."
Writing for WMO, Means concludes
cautiously : "There appears to be a
general consensus that cloud-seeding
can affect precipitation, but the effect
can be positive or in some cases
negative, depending upon meteorolo¬
gical conditions, background contami¬
nation and possibly other factors.
Some progress is being made in se¬
lecting meteorological conditions for
positive results. Cloud-seeding for
the enhancement of precipitation has
not yet reached the engineering phase
as has dissipation of cold fog."
Nor is it a cheap solution for eco¬
nomic growth. WMO, in fact, issues
a warning by Prof. E.A. Bernard : "It
is time to react against the tendency,
far too common in the developing
countries, to conduct experiments or
operations with artificial rainfall in an
attempt to mitigate the deficiencies of
the rainfall regime. These tempting
but costly practices should be left to
the advanced countries.
"So long as the latter have not
succeeded in providing a tested scien¬
tific and technological basis for such
operations, it will pay better to invest
the budgetary resources involved in
taking better advantage of the water
available on the basis of agrometeo-
rological and hydrometeorological
studies."
There is another factor that slows
such studies, in Prof. Bernard's opi¬
nion. Virtually every country has
airline services and there is no ques¬
tion of cutting corners on the quality
of meteorological facilities for air tra¬
vel. The result, he says, is that the
best of limited facilities must be made
available for aeronautical meteorology.
"As a result", he writes, "public
authorities have been led to consider
meteorology as an operational tech¬
nique for civil aviation. This regret¬
table state of affairs prevails in many
countries of the Third World. It inhib¬
its the setting up of true meteorolo¬
gical services intended primarily to
.serve national priorities in develop¬
ment."
HE moral of this story is
that no meteorologist can make manna
fall from the heavens. The kind of
benefits that James McQuigg describes
are the returns from heavy investment
in adequate meteorological services
and in training scientists to man them.
Prof. Bernard cites some eloquent
figures that WMO has gathered. Of
its 133 member nations, 105 are devel¬
oping countries. They spent $109
million in meteorology in 1968 as
against $854 million spent by twenty-
eight industrially developed countries.
On a per capita basis, this worked
out to $1.38 per North American and
.02 cents per Asian, a ratio of 70 to 1.
Until this ratio changes, it is likely
that in meteorology, as so many other
realms, the rich countries will get
richer and the poor countries will
become... what they have been all
along.

w,
HEN you hear the radio
announce that it will be sunny or that
it is going to rain, have you ever
wondered how these forecasts are
made? Do forecasters simply observe
the sky as our ancestors used to do?
It's quite true that a careful observer
can predict what the weather will be
like a few hours in advance. But
longer-range forecasts call for obser¬
vations of the atmosphere by weather
stations on sea and land covering a
very wide area (Europe and the Atlan¬
tic Ocean as far as the American
coast, for example).
Above all, weather forecasters need
to study the laws that govern the be¬
haviour of the atmosphere. Using this
information they can draw up meteo¬
rological maps and predict what the
weather will be like tomorrow or dur¬
ing the next few days.
THE EARTH'S The earth is
ATMOSPHERE enveloped in a
layer of gases
extending about 1,000 kilometres
above its surface. This layer is very
thin when compared with the earth's
radius (about 6,000 kilometres). The
upper limit of the atmosphere is not
clearly defined; it is the zone in which
molecules of air can reach high enough
speeds to be able to escape from the
gravitational pull of the earth, and is
called the exosphere.
The air composing the atmosphere
is a mixture of gases mainly nitrogen
and oxygen in fairly constant propor¬
tions. Water in the form of vapour is
mixed with these gases in widely vary¬
ing amounts. Together they make up
the air which we breathe and which
makes life on earth possible.
The four main features of the atmo¬
sphere are:
Temperature: measured with a thermo¬
meter;
Pressure: measured by a barometer;
atmospheric pressure is the force
acting on the surface of any object; a
thin-sided box in which a vacuum has
been produced would be crushed by
this pressure;
Humidity: measured by means of a
hygrometer or Psychrometer; it is the
proportion of water- vapour mixed with
the air;
Wind: measured by means of an anem¬
ometer; it is the speed of moving air
at a given point.
All these features vary according to
height and geographical location.
Variations due to altitude: pressure
falls the higher one rises in the atmo¬
sphere. At 5,000 metres it is only half
the pressure at the earth's surface, and

at 12,000 metres only a tenth. Pressure
cannot be directly measured in the
exosphere.
Temperature varies in a more com¬
plex fashion. The atmosphere is
divided into layers in which the tem¬
perature either rises or falls as altitude
increases.
In the lower layers of the atmo¬
sphere, temperature decreases on
average six degrees centigrade per
1,000 metres of altitude, up to the level
known as the tropopause above which
it stops decreasing.
The tropopause is at an altitude of
about 6,000 metres at the poles and
about 15,000 metres at the equator.
The temperatures are about 50 de¬
grees centigrade and 85 degrees
centigrade respectively.
Below the tropopause is the atmo¬
spheric layer called the troposphere.
It contains four-fifths of the mass of
the atmosphere and almost all its water
vapour. Within the troposphere vig¬
orous mixing of air and other inter¬
actions take place. This layer has
been called the world's "weather-
sphere".
At altitudes of over about 100 kilo¬
metres changes take place in the
physical properties of atmospheric
gases and particularly in their electrical
charges, due to bombardment of rays
coming from the sun. They become
what is known as "ionized", thus giv¬
ing the name "ionosphere" to this
layer of the atmosphere.
Variations due to geographical posi¬
tion: pressure and temperature, at a
given altitude, vary according to geo
graphical location, but such horizontal
variations are far less marked than the
vertical ones.
To find out about these variations,
and to collect other vital information
for meteorologists, a network of sta¬
tions is needed to make observations
simultaneously and using the same
methods for accurate comparison.
The results of these observations
are then rapidly exchanged, and this
can only be done through close inter¬
national collaboration.
WATER IIM THE Water is found
ATMOSPHERE in nature in
three forms:
liquid (water), solid (ice), gas (water
vapour).
Water exists as very fine droplets
which are so small that they fall only
very slowly like the mist from a
vaporizer forming clouds. Larger
drops fall more rapidly as rain.
Ice exists as fine crystals in the
higher clouds (cirrus), groups of crys¬
tals in snowflakes, or pellets of ice in
hail.
Water vapour is a colourless gas
mixed with air. The amount of water
vapour in the air varies up to the so-
called saturation limit which depends
on the temperature. The higher the
temperature the more water vapour
there can be in the same volume of air.
If air saturated with water vapour
cools, this creates an excess of water
vapour which becomes liquid, condens¬
ing on a surface or forming droplets.
In winter, in a warm, humid kitchen,
the windows, which are colder than
the air in the room, become covered
with mist.

Mapping atmospheric pressure
When you look at a weather map, you will see
a number of concentric circles. They indicate the
presence of low pressure areas (depressions) or
high pressure areas (anticyclones) which are a vital
factor in weather forecasting. The circles are formed
by drawing lines, called isobars, joining points of
equal pressure, just as on a geographical map
contour lines join points of equal height The
pressure becomes progressively lower towards the
centre of a depression and higher towards the
centre of an anticyclone (see drawings right). In
the northern hemisphere winds move in a clockwise
direction round anticyclones and anti-clockwise round
depressions. In the southern hemisphere these
directions are reversed.

### 51740: An ABC of meteorology
Clouds can form in many different ways. Moisture in the form of
water vapour is constantly being drawn up from the earth and the
oceans by evaporation to mix with the other gases of the air. Carried
by the wind, the vapour-laden air is forced to rise when it meets an
obstacle, such as a mountain (above left) or a mass of cold air (above).
As it rises the air cools and the water vapour condenses into tiny
particles of water which we see as clouds. Higher clouds (from 5 to
10 km. above the earth) are formed of minute ice crystals and these
are one of the most important causes of rain. In fact, at one time it was
thought that all rain, with the exception of some tropical rain, was
caused when these ice crystals, in dropping through a cloud, collided
with droplets below becoming bigger and bigger until they fell to earth
as raindrops, or as snow if it was very cold (right). Nowadays many
scientists believe that rain can form without ice crystals, even in non¬
tropical regions, when droplets collide forming larger and larger drops
which finally fall as rain.
In the troposphere, in addition to the
horizontal air movements which we
note as wind, important vertical move¬
ments occur which are more difficult
to detect. These movements may be
very extensive and cause a general
upward movement of a mass of air
over a whole region, or they may be
very localized, forming upward air cur¬
rents the "lift" used by certain birds
and by glider pilots.
Since pressure decreases with alti¬
tude, the air that rises becomes decom¬
pressed and as a result its tempera¬
ture falls. The same effect can be seen
in reverse with a bicycle pump which
heats up more and more as the air is
compressed.
If air is very humid, the water vapour
condenses into fine droplets and a
cloud forms. Under certain conditions,
the small droplets may come together
to form large drops which fall as rain.
THE CIRCULATION
OF THE
ATMOSPHERE
Atmo¬
spheric
press¬
ure is
such asnot uniform at a given level,
the surface of the earth. If we look
at pressure readings taken at the
observation posts of a chain of
weather stations we see that the
weather has its own "topography".
If we join the points of equal press¬
ure on a weather map by curves
known as isobars, we find that the out
lines resemble the height contours on
an ordinary relief map. Zones of high
pressure or anticyclones stand out like
hills, and areas of low pressure or
cyclones (depressions) correspond to
hollows or valleys. An isobar map is
thus a valuable aid for finding out
about the great movements of the
atmosphere, since isobars show the
pressure patterns which control the
way air flows.
Air does not flow directly from high
pressure to low pressure zones. Air
movement is influenced by the rotation
of the earth and the wind blows in a
direction parallel to the isobars. In
the northern hemisphere it turns in a
clockwise direction round the anti¬
cyclones and in the opposite direction
around cyclones (or depressions). In
the southern hemisphere, the direction
of movement is reversed. This move¬
ment can be observed by studying
wind observations reported by each
weather station.
Points of equal temperature are
linked by curves known as isotherms
which give us a general picture of the
temperature at a given level (ground-
level, for instance). Horizontal varia¬
tions in temperature are seen generally
to be minor except along certain lines
where they can be quite abrupt.
The atmosphere thus contains nar¬
row zones in which sharp contrasts in
temperature occur. The lines repres¬
enting these zones are called "fronts".
A front is described as "warm" if warm
air tends to displace cold air, and
"cold" if cold air replaces warmer air.
Various changes in the weather are
associated with these fronts, part¬
icularly the formation of clouds and
quite often showers of rain or snow.

STATION station is the
basic unit of a
weather service network. Each station
is set up to conform to identical stan¬
dards: on an unshaded site, preferably
a grassy one so as to eliminate
reflected solar radiation.
It consists basically of a meteoro¬
logical shelter which shields the
various instruments inside from the
direct rays of the sun and from wind
and rain. It is like a large crate, well-
ventilated and with its open side facing
north. Thus conditions inside are
everywhere the same.
What instruments are kept inside

Thermometers. An ordinary thermo¬

indicates the lowest temperature
reached; a maximum thermometer

Wind direction
WIND VANE
This instrument tells you which way the wind is
blowing. It is placed at the top of a pole. The vane
can be made of wood or metal in any shape or form,
ranging from the simple arrow on a cotton reel to the
perky squirrel shown here. But in every case the
tailor fin must be larger in surface than the head
or arrow point so that the wind can swing it around.
A large nail can be used as the axis. A bead makes
a good pivot to allow the vane to turn freely. Com¬
plete the wind vane by placing below it indicators
showing the four points of the compass.

### 51743: Build your own weather station
BUILD YOUR OWN
How would you like to build and run your own weather station ?
It's not as difficult as you might think. You may have to buy or
borrow a few items of equipment but you can quite easily make
some of the instruments you'll need from odds and ends.
Another idea would be to make this a class project in your
school with the help of your teacher.
Some of the instruments must be housed in a well-ventilated
shelter or " weather box ". Others, including a barometer, should
be grouped in the open air. Instrument stands and weather box
should be painted white to prevent the sun's radiation from
affecting the readings. You can even give your "met station"

WIND CONE
This instrument also shows wind direction. It is also known
as a wind sock or wind sleeve. From a piece of lightweight,
white cloth cut out the shape shown in the diagram above at left
(figures show suggested size in centimetres). Then sew the two
straight edges (marked "50") together to form the cone. Take
a piece of strong wire and bend it into a circle to fit the big end
of the cone. Slip two small curtain rings on to the wire and
then fix them at opposite sides of the ring. Sew the cone to the
wire circle. Slip a thin metal rod through the two curtain rings
and attach the rod to the end of a pole fixed in the ground.
As with the wind vane, a small bead slipped onto the rod allows
the cone to rotate easily. If desired, the wind cone and the wind
vane can be fitted to the same pole.
HYGROMETER
Used to measure the humidity of the atmosphere, a hygrometer is quite
simple to make. Take an "L-shaped* piece of wood and cut a small
window in it Below the window fix a small cotton-reel in such a way
that it can rotate freely. Attach a pointer to the cotton-reel and mark
out a scale opposite the pointer.
The operation of the hygrometer is based on the fact that hair strands
lengthen when humidity rises and shorten when the air is drier.
Attach a human hair, free from grease, to a point above the window,
pass it two or three times round the cotton-reel and suspend a small
weight at the end of the hair to maintain tension.
Placing a container of boiling water under the apparatus will cause
the hair strand to lengthen and will send the arrow to the point of
100 per cent relative humidity. Mark this point on the scale and calibrate
the rest of the scale if possible by comparison with another hygrometer
that has already been calibrated.

### 51743: Build your own weather station
WEATHER STATION
a really professional look by putting a decorative fence around it.
After you've built your weather station you can start noting and
recording the instrument readings. But you must do this as
regularly as clockwork if the records are to be meaningful.
Then you can try your hand at forecasting the weather in your
locality. Compare your own predictions with the radio and TV
forecasts. If they don't tally, try to work out the reasons. Building
and operating a do-it-yourself weather station can be an exciting
and fascinating hobby that wilt be richly rewarding for many
years to come.
WEATHER BOX
Two wooden boxes are
all you needone small
enough to fit inside the
other with a space in bet¬
ween. Remove one side of
each box (the one that will
face North) and pierce
airholes through the other
sides. Make sure that the
holes of the outside box
do NOT line up with the
holes of the inner box, so that the sun's rays can never penetrate
the inner box.
Thermometers and other instruments must be carefully
protected from the sun, the rain and the snow, in order to obtain
true readings, unaffected by the sun's rays or radiation reflected
from the ground or nearby buildings.
Cap the box with a double-sloping roof that gives good
protection on the open North side.
Fix the box in an open place on a post or picket 1è metres
from the ground (this is the internationally agreed standard
height). Hang the instruments on hooks to keep them from
touching the sides of the box.

E. Metal flap

ANEMOMETER
This instrument is used to measure the force of
the wind. Take a piece of wood (about 30 cm. X
30 cm.) to form the base board A and fix it to the
top of a post. Take a rectangular piece of metal,
cut it out in the curved shape shown at B in the
diagram. Mark it to form a scale and attach at right
angles to the centre of the base. With three pieces
of wood make an inverted "U-shaped" bracket C
bridging the scale, having first cut a slot D in the
cross-piece of the bracket. Cut a rectangular flap E
from a piece of light metal (an empty food tin would
do) with a "U-shaped" portion cut out of one end
F. Fix a nail across the slot at the top of the
bracket and curve the end of the metal flap around
the nail so that it can swing freely. The other end
of the flap F will straddle the scale. Turn the
apparatus in the direction of the wind and the flap
will be tilted at an angle varying with the force of
the wind.
One way to calibrate the anemometer is to hold it
out of the window of a moving car (your school bus
driver may help you with this) and note the angle of
tilt of the flap at 10, 20, 30, 40, etc. kilometres per
hour.
Another way to calculate wind velocity is by using
the Beaufort scale (see page 38).
PSYCHROMETER
A. Diameter of funnel
RAIN GAUGE
A simple rain gauge to measure the amount of rainfall is very
easy to make. All you need is a straight-sided bottle and a
funnel. The funnel should have either a very sharp vertical edge
or a horizontal lip to prevent the raindrops bouncing out again.
The diameter of the mouth of the funnel (A) must be the same
as the diameter of the bottle (B). If you cannot find a bottle and
a funnel of exactly the same diameter, take a larger funnel and
cut away the top until it is the same diameter as the bottle.
With a ruler mark a scale
in millimetres up the side
of the bottle. Place the
funnel in the bottle and put
them both In a hole dug in
the earth so that the mouth
of the funnel is just a few
centimetres above ground
level. After a period of
rain, take the bottle out of
the earth and check the
water level against the
scale. If you get a reading
of, for example, 3 mm.,
then this is the rainfall for
your area. vtV-fc	 Is B. Diameter

This is another instrument used for measuring the
humidity of the atmosphere (see hygrometer). Fix
two identical thermometers side by side on a board.
One of them (here shown at left) will record the
temperature in the normal way.
Below the thermometer at right attach a wide-
mouthed jar filled with water. Make a wick out of
a piece of cloth about 20 centimetres high. Wind
the wick round the base of this thermometer and
leave the other end soaking in the water.
If the atmosphere is very humid the two thermo¬
meters will show the same temperature. If the
atmosphere is very dry there will be a marked
difference between the two temperature readings.
In this way you will have a relative idea of how
humid the air is. Scientists use special tables
(called psychrometric tables) to obtain very precise
humidity readings.

atmosphere by the use of catgut or
strands of hair which expand when
the air is moist and contract when it
is dry.
A Psychrometer, also used to measure
humidity.
An evaporimeter. This instrument is
used to measure evaporation.
Other instruments are placed just
outside the shelter:
A wind vane (the modern version of
the weather-cock often seen on church
steeples) which indicates the direction
of the wind.
An anemometer (four small cone-
shaped cups at the end of rods that
rotate on a vertical spindle) to measure
wind speed.
These instruments are electrically
linked to the observation hut where
the measurements are shown on dials.
A heliograph, which records on sun-
sensitive paper the amount of sunshine
during the day.
The station is also equipped with a
mercury barometer to measure atmo¬
spheric pressure and a recording baro¬
meter that gives a continuous graph
of pressures.
To measure wind speeds at high
altitudes, meteorologists release hydro¬
gen-filled "sounding balloons" whose
rate of climb is known. By tracking
their flight the speed and direction of
winds can be determined as well as
the altitude of the base of a cloud
layer at the moment the balloon pene¬
trates it.
A basket can be attached to larger
balloons containing a radiosonde that
transmits back to earth details of air
pressure, temperature and humidity.
CODED All these
WEATHER observa-
INFORMATION »ions are
sent in, as¬
sembled and retransmitted. Information
comes in from every corner of the
globe, from stations perched on the
peaks of exposed mountains, from
meteorological outposts deep in the
Arctic, from weather-ships, aircraft,
etc. They are sent to forecasting cen¬
tres in a condensed international code
consisting of five figure groups. Each
group and each figure represents a
different element of the weather.
SYNOPTIC Observa-
WEATHER MAPS tions made at
se hed u I ed
times are transcribed by figures and
symbols on an outline map to produce
what is called a "synoptic map".
The synoptic map gives, in schematic
form, a broad picture of the state of
the atmosphere at a particular time,
over a certain area of the globe.
If we compare a series of maps
drawn up at fixed intervals (at 6, 12
or 18 hour periods), we see that the
"weather picture" on the maps chan¬
ges very considerably during these
periods. Depressions and anticyclones
move at greater or lesser speeds,
either growing larger or tending to
disappear. Anticyclones may remain
stationary or may move, though
generally rather slowly. Although de¬
pressions are sometimes stationary,
they usually tend to be more mobile.
Fronts move in the direction of the air
currents in which they occur.
Generally speaking, these different
weather "ingredients" are carried along
in a larger current, at varying speeds,
from west to east. To complement the
surface maps, upper-air charts are
drawn up at different levels using data
supplied by sounding stations. These
charts contain only part of the data
used for surface maps (pressure for
charts at constant level or altitude for
charts at constant pressure, tempera¬
ture, humidity and wind).
FORECASTING Using a series
of maps it is
possible to estimate the movements
and developments of various weather
elements and thus to draw up a fore¬
cast map showing atmospheric condi¬
tions for some time ahead, usually
during the next 24 or 48 hours.
But to determine how the situation
will develop the meteorologist must
also apply a number of rules and
physical laws in his calculations.
Nowadays meteorologists use electro¬
nic computers to help them in making
forecast maps.
The meteorologist uses these fore¬
cast maps to draw up his weather
predictions for a particular area, while
taking local conditions into account.
The texts and diagrams in this children's
section are based on material drawn
from: 1. a "meteorology kit", prepared
and published by the Centre de Docu¬
mentation Pédagogique, Geneva, Switzer¬
land, under tfte direction of 1.1. Dessou-
lavy; 2. the "Unesco Source Book for
Science Teaching"; 3. "A Manual for
Improvised Science Equipment", by T.E.
Calvero and E.S. Sábado, under the
direction of Pedro Orata, Quezon City
Philippines.
The Beaufort
wind scale
To indicate the velocity of the wind
meteorologists use a series of
numbers known as the Beaufort
scale. The scale was devised in
1806 by a British admiral, Sir Fran¬
cis Beaufort who defined the num¬
bers in terms of the effect of various
winds on sailing vessels from a
calm, force 0, to a hurricane, force
12, "that which no canvas could
withstand." The scale was adopted
in 1874 by the International Meteoro¬
logical Committee for international
use in telegraphy. Today the Beau¬
fort scale is defined in terms of
wind speeds measured in some
countries at 10. metres above the
ground and in others at 6 metres.

11 Storm Widespread damage; very rare occurrence. 103-117
12 Hurricane Violent destruction. 118 and

Like human fingerprints, no two snow crystals
are ever exactly alike. Although often similar in
general outline and structure, snow crystals come
in a bewildering variety of size, shape and pattern.
They often take the form of triangles, hexagons
or six-pointed stars. When the air is very moist
they may clump together to form snowflakes. One
snowf lake may consist of as many as 50 interlocking
crystals. Enthralled by their beauty, an American
farmer-meteorologist, Wilson A. Bentley, spent
hours each winter photographing snow crystals
near his home in Vermont. Nearly half the 5,000
photomicrographs he prepared appeared in the
book "Snow Crystals", first published in 1931 by
McGraw-Hill Books, New York; we reproduce
18 of these illustrations below.

FRANÇOIS LE LIONNAIS. Meteorologists use
lots of technical words that are unknown to the
man-in-the-street. As a meteorologist, would you
like to give a few examples?
ROGER CLAUSSE Well, to take a few at random, I could
mention anticyclone, isobar, cyclogenesis, frontolysis, hydro-
meteor or isohypse. Then there are everyday words with
a special meaning, such as "waves" as in "polar frontal
waves" or the word "family" in the expression "family of
disturbances", which means alternate zones of rain clouds,
showers and brief intervals of fine weather. Another fami¬
liar word with a special meaning is "front", in the sense of
a surface where masses of warm and cold air come into
"conflict" the same idea as front in the military sense.
F. L. L. The words you just mentioned front,
conflict, masses of air aren't they connected with
what we usually call bad weather? What causes bad
weather?
R- C. Bad weather is caused by differences of atmo¬
spheric pressure in different parts of the world. Generally
speaking, bad weather is linked with zones of low pressure,
while zones of high pressure keep the bad weather out.
F. L. L. Perhaps you would explain what exactly
atmospheric pressure means?
R. C. Anyone who has looked at a barometer knows
that atmospheric pressure, which corresponds to the weight
of air pressing down on a given surface area, can vary

TALKING ABOUT THE WEATHER (Continued)
from one reading to the next. Atmospheric pressure varies
from one part of the world to another, but at any given
moment pressure will be constant along imaginary lines
which one can draw on the map.
For example, in Brazil pressure might be the same in
Bahia, Carinhanah, Brasilia and Araguari. The line joining
these points is what we call an isobar, which simply means
a line of equal pressure. A different isobar with a different
value might, for instance, pass through other Brazilian cities
such as llheus, Belo, Horizonte and Rio de Janeiro.
These isobars thus correspond to varying values of
atmospheric pressure at a given moment over a region
which can vary considerably in extent. Taken all together
they make up what is called the field of pressure. They
are given in millibars, a unit signifying the amount of pres¬
sure which will support, roughly, three-quarters of a milli¬
metre of mercury in a barometer tube. So what is known
as standard pressure (1013.3 millibars) will support a column
of mercury 760 mm. high or, to give you a better idea, it
represents 1,033 grammes of air pressing down on every
square centimetre.
These isobars form curvy shapes. One might imagine
one of them, say isobar 1,000, passing in the U.S.S.R.
through Odessa, Berdichev, Gomel, Voronezh, Mizlerovo
and back to Odessa, thus describing a rather irregular
circle. Inside this line, there may be other "contour lines",
getting smaller and representing lower and lower pressures
975 - 970 - 965 millibars, etc. This is what we call
a depression, in which the nearer the isobars are to the
centre the lower the pressures they represent.
In other zones the pressure increases towards the centre,
and these are called anticyclones.
Broadly speaking:
a depression is a zone of low pressure and an anti¬
cyclone is a zone of high pressure.
If we keep this idea in mind, it will help us to identify
zones of fine weather and bad weather.
F. L. L. From this idea of anticyclones and
depressions, can. we tell what the weather is going
to be like?
January in Kabul market-place, Afghanistan.
R. C. Certainly. The deeper a depression that is, the
lower the pressure at the centre, the smaller its diameter,
and the more rapidly it moves the more marked will be
the meteorological processes which go with it. In other
words a small depression with a very low pressure at the
centre is likely to be accompanied by a storm. Once we
understand this code, we can at once decipher any graphic
representation of the weather situation such as maps
shown in television weather forecasts.
Because of the effect of the Earth's rotation, winds
move in a clockwise direction around anticyclones and
in the opposite direction around depressions in the northern
hemisphere, and these directions are reversed in the south¬
ern hemisphere.
The position of these elements on the map thus gives
an immediate idea of the general movement of winds in
a particular area. To the east of a large-scale anticyclone,
in the northern hemisphere, for instance, the wind will be
coming from the north and will therefore be cold, while to
the west it will be a warm south wind. It is easy to get
a mental picture of all the possible combinations and all
the winds which would result from them and thus to have
some idea of the likely temperature.
F. L. L. You mentioned storms 'just now. Could
you say a few words about the storms we call
cyclones?
R. C. Yes, because there may be some confusion about
the word cyclone. The basic idea behind the word
cyclone is that of a circular, turning movement. We now
know that this is what happens in the case of depressions
around which the wind and in some cases rain move in
a circle.
A depression is thus a cyclone in this sense, and
meteorologists use either word to mean the same thing.
But most persons use the term cyclone when they mean
tropical cyclones, which originate in the warmer regions
of the world over the oceans. These disturbances are
relatively small a few hundred miles across and the
pressure at their centre is very low 900 millibars, the
equivalent of 675 mm. of mercury. They are accompanied
by very violent winds sometimes reaching more than

200 km./h. They have the typical circling movement
corresponding to the word cyclone.
F. L. L. Do cyclones move about from place to
place very rapidly?
R. C. No, fortunately they move relatively slowly, at
about 20 to 50 km./h., which means that it is possible to
detect them and to forecast their arrival either by means
of radar or by pictures sent back by satellites, from which
they are easily visible in the form of a ring of clouds.
F. L. L. By a ring of clouds, do you mean
that the sky is clear in the middle?
R. C. Yes, this is called the eye of the cyclone, where
the sky is usually clear. Satellite photographs have shown
that even the cyclones in the temperate part of the world
depressions accompanied by clouds and rain often have
a small eye in the middle, which goes to prove that they
are formed in the same way as tropical cyclones.
F. L. L. Just how and why do tropical cyclones
begin?
R. C. Cyclones originate for the most part over the
oceans in the tropics, where the temperature of the sea
and of the layer of air in contact with it is very high in
relation to the upper levels of the air. This causes violent
upward movements, drawing masses of very humid air up
from sea level. These conditions often occur during the
hot season in both hemispheres.
F. L. L. How long does a cyclone last?
R. C. Usually about a week. After that the depression
either fills or spreads out, in either case becoming less
intense. We might in passing mention two other names
connected with cyclones: typhoon, which is simply another
name for the cyclones occurring in the China Sea, and hurri¬
cane, which is another synonym of tropical cyclones, used
in the English-speaking parts of the world.
F. L. L. What word from the language of the
meteorologist shall we look at now?
R. C. Well, as a change from the more violent aspects
of the weather, let's talk about trade winds. Most people
have heard about them and associate them with the sea.
F. L. L. That's right, because in the days of
sailing ships, merchant ships depended greatly on
trade winds. And as a matter of fact they helped
the ships of Christopher Columbus to sail from
Europe to America.
R. C. Some people say that Columbus discovered these
winds. Incidentally the French word for the trade winds
"alizés" is believed to come from an old French word
meaning "regular". The trade winds do in fact blow fairly
regularly in the intertropical zone, from the north-east in
the northern hemisphere and from the south-east in the
southern. They are caused by the same sort of phenom¬
enon as we have just been describing, that of air currents
circulating around the anticyclones which persist over the
tropical regions of the oceans while low pressures prevail
over the equator. They are not very strong from about
15 to 30 km./h. and are usually accompanied by fine
weather.
F. L. L. What happens between these two belts of
winds, at the equator itself?
R. C This is where the equatorial calms occur, the
"doldrums" which sailors in bygone days used to dread.
English sailors also called these regions the "horse
latitudes", apparently because when ships were becalmed
for days or even weeks on end, they had to throw their
horses overboard when their supplies of water and hay
ran out.
F. L. L. While we are on the subject of wind,
perhaps you could tell us about the various terms
used by meteorologists and sailors for strong winds.
R. C. First of all there are the gusts of wind which occur
during a thunderstorm, and which, if they recur frequently,
are characteristic of an unstable, turbulent state of the
atmosphere. Wind speeds in such gusts can vary widely
and rapidly and can reach over 20 m. per second in a few
seconds, which is dangerous for anything which is suscep¬
tible to the wind, such as tents, cranes or sailing boats.
Gales, for which warnings to shipping are sometimes
broadcast, are winds with an average force of more than
34 knots (62 km./h), which is equivalent to force 8 on the
Beaufort scale, so called after the English admiral who
invented it (see page 38). Gale force winds can whip up
waves over 5 m. high, which are very dangerous for sailing
craft. After the gale comes the "strong gale", a wind
which blows at between 75 and 88 km./h.
F. L. L. While on the subject of winds and the sea,
could you tell us about breezes, which are more
popular with sailors than storms?
R- C. Breezes are local winds, usually not very strong
and changing direction depending on the time of day.
When the sun is shining over the coast, both the shore and
the sea are heated by the sun but the land gets hotter than
the sea. Upward currents are formed over the land,
drawing in the cooler sea air. An on-shore (towards the
land) breeze is thus created this happens about three
hours after sunrise and goes on until the sun sets. Sandy
or rocky coasts absorb more heat than wooded coasts,
so that the breezes will be more noticeable.
At night the land cools more quickly than the sea, with the
result that the movement of air is reversed and we have
an off-shore (towards the sea) breeze. This partly explains
why the climate is mild at the seaside because it is warmed
at night by the breezes coming from the land and cooled
in the daytime by the sea breezes.
F. L. L. Does this also happen in other places?
R. C. Yes, in mountain regions where the cold air comes
down from the mountains at night, bringing lower tempera¬
tures with it, while in the daytime the warmer air rises from
the valleys towards the mountain peaks, sometimes causing
the sudden thunderstorms which are a menace to moun¬
taineers. Incidentally, the alternate heating and cooling of
land and sea which produce land and sea breezes are
reproduced on a larger scale in the case of monsoons.
F. L. L. I always thought monsoons were sea¬
sonal winds.
R. C. You're right. They are seasonal. In summer,
the continents heat up more quickly than the oceans.
Rising warm currents over the land create low pressure
areas and cooler air over the oceans flows towards the
continents. These air currents laden with moisture from
the oceans bring with them clouds and torrential rains.
Passing over the steadily rising land to the mountains of
Tibet, for instance, the rising air begins to condense and
precipitate its water vapour. In the winter the process is
reversed and dry air pours seawards from the colder
continental mass. "Monsoon" comes from the Arabic word
for "season", and was first applied to winds of the Arabian
Sea that blow six months from the south-west and six
months from the north-east.
F. L L. So monsoons occur in other places than
India.
R. C. Yes, monsoons are particularly intense in south¬
east Asia, but they also exist, to varying degrees, in the
western part of the Pacific Ocean, northern Australia, parts
of Africa and even along the edge of the Gulf of Mexico.
F. L. L. Now, what about a word which interests
all of us sunshine.
R. C. Meteorologists use the word insolation, rather than
sunshine, in other words, the amount of direct solar radia¬
tion received. They also speak of "insolation duration",
meaning the number of hours and minutes in a day, month
or year when the sun is visible from a given point.
Paris in July, for instance, gets on average 238 hours
of sunshine, Nice 363, Kazan 300, New Delhi about 200
(since it is the monsoon season in India), Perth 250, Rio
and Addis Ababa 200 each, and of course there is none at
all in the Antarctic, where it is the middle of the long
winter night.

TALKING ABOUT THE WEATHER (Continued)
42
F. L. L. When the sun is more or less covered by
hazy cloud, one sometimes sees rings round it. Such
optical phenomena, which usually occur near the sun
or the moon, are known as haloes and coronas, but
people tend to confuse them. Would you tell us
about them?
R. C. Yes, we call them "photometeors", in other words,
optical phenomena of the atmosphere as against "hydro-
meteors", which are composed of solid or liquid water
particles such as rain, snow or fog. The commonest of
the photometeors are the halo, the corona and of course
the rainbow, which we all know.
The halo forms a circle of bright light around the sun
or moon. If you hold out your hand at arm's length with
the palm covering the sun, the circle should appear at
the end of your fingers. Sometimes there is another
circle around the first and sometimes there are even bright
spots on either side of the sun or moon so-called "pillars"
or luminous tangent arcs.
These effects are caused by the refraction of the light
passing through the ice crystals of which high clouds
are formed, when such clouds form a continuous "cloud
veil" often a sign of bad weather.
F. L. L. So the popular belief that a wide ring
around the sun means rain really has some basis.
R. C. Yes, and the belief that a smaller circle means that
rain is not in the offing is also correct. This smaller ring,
which is much less clear, is a corona. The corona has
more colours than the halo, and is closer to the sun or
moon.
It is caused by the diffraction of light through the fine
water droplets not ice crystals this time of the thin
clouds covering the sun. The corona thus usually appears
when there is what is called a "mackerel sky". It may be
a sign of poor weather, with light rain, but this is not an
absolute certainty.
These ideas about the approach of bad weather, bring
us to the term "atmospheric disturbance". A disturbance
is a kind of atmospheric "ailment", which corresponds to
the arrival of a depression and begins with a period of
"incubation". The wind changes to south or south-west
(to take a typical example in the temperate zones of the
northern hemisphere).
Pressure falls, thin clouds appear and begin to accumulate
until they have formed a fine, continuous veil of cirrostratus
cloud which completely covers the sky the sort of cloud
veil we were talking about a moment ago. The barometer
is now at its lowest point, the wind has veered to the west,
and now a hole appears in the cloud cover.
There may now be a clear interval, but before the fine
weather returns, there will be more showers, with fine
periods becoming more and more frequent. The wind
which is now blowing more strongly, sometimes in gusts,
has veered further to the north-west, the barometer rises
again and finally the sky clears.
F. L. L. What about the question of fog and
visibility.
R. C. Fog is another phenomenon which we come across
at the seaside. Sailors sometimes call anything that
hampers visibility a sea mist, but the meteorologist uses
the terms more precisely. He uses the word fog in cases
where visibility is less than one kilometre and mist when
visibility is between one and two kilometres.
F. L. L. Is there an accurate way of measuring
visibility?
R. C. Yes, there are instruments called visibility meters,
which use a light source at a set distance linked to a photo¬
electric cell which makes it possible to measure the degree
of opacity of the air through which the light passes. The
major airports have a very sophisticated system of this sort
on their runways. Instruments in the control tower enable
the air traffic controllers to see at what distance the landing
lights on the runways will be visible to pilots.
F. L. L. Talking about fog, which consists of minute
water droplets suspended in the air, brings us to the
question of pollution, one of the major problems of
our time.
R. C. To see how the various pollutants which are
pumped into the air collect in the lower levels, we need
to go higher into the atmosphere.
We know that in the lower part of the atmosphere, which
is called the troposphere, temperature falls as we go up,
at the rate of about 0.6° C. for every 100 metres or so,
which means that at an altitude of 10 km., the temperature
will be minus 60° C. So we can understand why aircraft
are properly insulated!
But in the layers of air nearest to the ground, there are
many exceptions to this general rule. When thick fog
covers Paris, a thermometer at the bottom of the Eiffel
Tower may show 10° C, while another thermometer at the
top of the tower may register 15°. This often happens in
winter. When the night sky is clear and there is not much
wind, the ground loses much of Its heat by radiation. The
air nearest to it also cools, becoming heavier and remaining
close to the earth's surface, whereas the air above it, being
a poor conductor, keeps more or less the same temperature.
It becomes warmer than the air near to the ground, or at
least warmer than it would be if temperature fell off with
altitude in the normal way.
Thus we have what is called an inversion of temperature.
When it occurs, the air is very stable, since the upper layer
forms a sort of lid which prevents smoke, dust and exhaust
fumes from escaping. They thus stagnate at ground level
for days on end, making the pollution worse and worse.
F. L. L. If inversions of temperature can be forecast,
do special precautions need to be taken?
R. C. Yes, in heavily industrialized areas measures may
be taken to cut back production in industries which cause
pollution or where possible to use products which cause
less pollution. Inversions of temperature can be detected
by means of radiosondes (balloons carrying instruments
aloft whose recordings are transmitted by radio to ground
stations). These devices enable us to find out the temper¬
ature of the air at various levels up to a height of more
than 20 km.
F. L. L. What happens above the inversion layer?
R. C. The temperature again falls off with the altitude,
unless there happens to be a second inversion layer. This
may be caused by the arrival of warm air from a higher
level, which might be the sign of an atmospheric
disturbance on the way. Higher still, about 10 km. up in
the temperate regions, about 7 km. at the poles and about
17 km. at the equator, comes the stratosphere where the
temperature stops falling and starts rising.
F. L. L. What is the temperature at that level?
R. C. At the poles it is about -50° C, in the temperate
regions about -56° C, and at the equator -85° C. This
means that an aircraft flying from the North or South Pole
towards the equator at an altitude of 15 to 17 km. would
have to turn up its heating system, since the outside
temperature would fall from -50° C. to -85° C. in the course
of the journey, in spite of the fact that at ground level the
temperature is getting higher all the time.
F. L. L. Why not go even higher and take a look
at the upper atmosphere which spacemen now traverse
on their missions? You mentioned the troposphere,
in which the temperature falls as one rises, but
you said that above that, in the stratosphere, the
temperature is at first stationary and then begins
to increase.
R. S. That's right, the temperature within this layer of
the atmosphere, which extends from about 10 km. up to
about 50 km., rises from -56° C- to 0. This is due among
other things to the presence of ozone, which is concentrated
about 35 km. up. Contrary to what used to be thought,
violent winds blow through the stratosphere, sometimes
reaching well over 350 km./h.
Above the stratosphere, in the layer known as the
mésosphère, extending up for about a further 30 km., the
temperature falls off again rapidly, reaching 90D below
zero C. at its upper limit, a height of about 80 km.

### 51744: A Short guide to weather-speak
Patterns in the sky
A sodium vapour cloud writes a
strange message hundreds of miles
up in the sky during a rocket
experiment designed to measure
high-altitude winds and tempera¬
tures. Here, French scientists study
the vapour experiment, launched
from NASA's Wallops Island Station
in Virginia.
Beyond that again, in the thermosphère which extends
to the outer limits of our atmosphere, 1,000 or so km. up,
the temperature again rises, though it varies considerably.
Beyond the level of 200 km., the speed of the highly rarefied
molecules of gas corresponds to temperatures of several
hundreds of degrees but because the air is so rarefied, its
real temperature in normal physical terms is extremely
low.
F. L. L. One word in the meteorologist's voca¬
bulary which everybody knows and understands
is "forecasting". But some people feel that weather
forecasters tend to be overconfident in their pre¬
dictions; that their forecasts are still a far from
sure guide to tomorrow's weather, unlike forecasts
of the tides or the positions of the stars.
R. C. It's true that weather forecasts sometimes tell us:
"Cloud will develop tomorrow morning in the eastern part
of the country" in much the same way as an astronomer
might announce: "The annular eclipse of the sun will begin
at 1 hr. 30.3 minutes Universal Time at 66°20 minutes East
and 20° North" and as far in advance as you like.
Yet there is clearly quite a different degree of accuracy
in these two forecasts: one tends to be rather vague while
the other has a mathematical precision. But I'm sure it
would be rather boring if forecasters were to tell us: "All
we can say about the weather tomorrow is that cloud may
develop in the morning west of a line drawn very roughly
from..., etc."
What is certain is that even with the most powerful
computers, meteorologists can only give the most likely
interpretation, based on the information they have and
using approximate equations which enable them to simulate
the state of the atmosphere and the changes taking place
in it. I agree it would be better if they could indicate the
degree of probability of the prediction they have come up
with, but there are still problems to be solved in this area.
F. L. L. Before we end our visit to the world
¡of meteorology, would you please explain the myste¬
rious terms which you mentioned at the beginning
cyclogenesis, frontolysis and isohypse.
R. C. These terms are hardly ever used in weather
forecasts for the general public, but I can give you a brief
definition: cyclogenesis, as its name suggests, is the pro¬
cess by which a cyclonic circulation is formed; frontolysis
is the process which causes a weather front to weaken or
disappear, in other words, the effects produced by the
encounter of masses of air originating from different sour¬
ces; and an isohypse is a surface, generally an isobaric
surface, within which pressure is constant. So as you see,
the meanings of even these unfamiliar words are really
quite simple.

This scene of death and desolation in Mauritania is being repeated
over thousands of kilometres in Africa south of the Sahara.
Drought and famine have stricken at least a dozen countries,
among the worst affected being Senegal, Mauritania, Upper
Volta, Mali, Niger and Chad. Cattle are the livelihood of some
70 per cent of the population of this area and the U.N. Food
and Agriculture Organization has estimated that the virtual
extinction of many of the herds vital to villagers and nomad
herdsmen Is now a serious possibility.

OVER AFRICA
1- tragedy strikes millions
of men and cattle
2- is the Sahara desert
moving South?
J --
by Jean Dresch

JEAN DRESCH Is professor of geography
at the University of Pans and at France's
Ecole Normale Supérieure. He is a leading
authority on the world's arid zones, notably
those of North Africa and Africa south of
the Sahara, and has written extensively on
this subject.
T AMINE threatens millions
of villagers and herdsmen with their
decimated flocks, today forced into an
unprecedented migration in search of
food and water, in all the West African
countries to the south of the Sahara,
from Mauritania to the Sudan.
Its cause is drought, a prolonged
decline in rainfall that has been
recorded as far as central Asia,
throughout the periphery of the arid
zone, extending from the tropical
desert of the Sahara to the continental
deserts of temperate Eurasia.
Drought, admittedly, is the normal
condition in these countries, and the
living world has adapted to it. In Africa
these regions bear the Arabic name
of Sahel, which means the border,
whether of the desert or of the sea;
for they are not really part of the
desert proper.
The soil is less purely mineral than
the present-day soil of the Sahara and
bears a generally open, scattered
vegetation in the form of "steppes" of
trees, bushes and annuals Gramina-
ceae or of other families.
The vegetation grows denser and
lusher in the lower latitudes and
becomes savanna, a closed formation
which feeds herbivores, and hence
carnivores, in increasing numbers but
exposes them to burning in brush fires.
In these regions man is no longer
obliged, as he is in the desert, to lead
either a nomadic life linked to the
dromedary or the secluded life of the
watered oases. He can raise cattle
and small livestock. He can till the soil
without irrigation.
For all that, these are the frontiers
of the desert. Man and the other
living creatures follow the rhythm of
two main seasons, one the longer
almost completely dry, the other both
humid and hot.

\*ft-
The Sahel feels the effect of cells
of tropical high pressure, which separ¬
ate the low-pressure areas of the
equatorial latitudes from those often
characteristic of medium' latitudes.
These high-pressure cells set very
regular, dry winds blowing towards the
low latitudes: these are the continental
trade winds, called in West Africa the
Harmattan.
The rains follow the apparent motion
of the sun to the Tropic of Cancer
during the northern summer. Thus
masses of moist air advance coming
from the Atlantic Ocean or the Congo
Basin with southerly winds, which are
diverted north-eastwards as they cross
into the northern hemisphere.
These air masses and winds, known
as monsoons, encounter the tropical
dry air and the trade winds (inter¬
tropical convergence), plunge beneath
them and lift them. That is the time
when the rains fall; they are plentiful
and long-lasting in the south when the
moist air mass is thick. Further north
they are less and less so. Disturban¬
ces still occur but the hot-air tornadoes
of the late afternoon are increasingly
often dry as the moist air mass thins
out and loses more of its moisture.
Under these conditions the precipi¬
tation decreases together with the
duration of the wet season from 600 to
800 mm., where the wet season lasts
five to six months, down to 250 mm.,
where the season is only three months
long.
The shorter the rainy season, the
more irregular it is in space, in time
over the year, and from one year to
another. The rains may start earlier
or later, and may last a longer or a
shorter time.
Furthermore, temperatures also rise
with the apparent motion of the sun,
so that mean maximum temperatures
exceed 35 and 40 degrees C. in April
and May, except near the sea. The
coming of the rains brings them down
a little, but they are still high enough
to cause three times more évapotrans¬
piration (loss of water by evaporation
from the soil and by transpiration from
plants) during the day than during the
night.
To be of practical value, therefore,
the rainfall must not only be generally
abundant, but also intense yet not
too intense, about 20 to 25 mm. during
one or two days at the beginning of
the rainy season.
The rains are not always spread to
the best advantage over the course
of a year, and each year is different
from the next. Sometimes a series
of good years occurs, only to be
followed by a bad year or a series of
bad years.
A sequence of dry years is remem¬
bered in 1910-1914, when they caused
a real famine. 1941 and 1942 were

no better; and dry years have been
succeeding one another since 1968,
whereas the decade 1951-1960 was
wetter. But there is no cyclical rhythm
from which to predict disasters.
This year-to-year irregularity in rain¬
fall is also characteristic of the Sahel
on a larger time-scale. More and more
is being learned about the detailed
development of climatic conditions
over the Quaternary era. It appears
that sweeping changes occurred, from
fairly wet periods to extremely dry
periods in which the Saharan winds
pushed the dunes 200 to 300 km.
further south than the living dunes of
today.
On the other hand several wet
phases have been detected, the most
recent being put at 6,000 to 2,300 years
ago. The entire Sahara was better
watered during that time. There were
extensive lakes, and it is probable that
black populations practised agriculture
in the Sahel.
Cattle-rearing went on till much later,
it was replaced by horse and then
camel-rearing. Even in the Middle
Ages, however, the aridity was not so
severe. Many farming villages sur¬
vived in the Mauritanian Adrar for
example. The rate of precipitation
must have been 400 to 450 mm, the
strict minimum for rain-watered tillage
and double the present rate.
It is thought likely that the subse¬
quent drying-out process has speeded
up since the end of the last century.
It is said that rainfall is diminishing,
wells are running dry, rivers are flood¬
ing less often and in less volume,
dunes are being revitalized, vegetation
is deteriorating and game animals are
scarcer.
Does this mean that the climate
itself is becoming drier? Fluctuations
are a matter of historical record; they
are as yet unexplained, but they are
not always in the same direction.
Over the decade 1950-1960 there was
enough rain to speed up the northward
movement of the cattle-herders, the
Peul, and of the millet-growers. The
herdsmen come looking for grazing,
and contend for it with the Saharans
who have to leave the desert in the
dry season.
The millet-growers colonize the
Sahel, like a pioneer fringe, in search
of new lands, whether they are black
peasants or former Saharans, often the
servants of nomadic tribes in process
of settling.
The natural conditions in the Sahel,
then, are known, and man, with. his
age-old techniques, has managed to
adapt his economy and his migratory
movements to them.
Today it should be possible to put
better scientific knowledge of the
Sahel and modern techniques to use,
not only in relieving the victims of
drought but in bringing drought itself
under control. However, it must be
recognized that the Sahels are very
marginal regions for the international
economy.
Development activities have been
focused on regions further south,
which were better watered and which
could grow crops at a profit for foreign
markets. As a rule these are non-food
crops such as groundnut and cotton;
it is known that they have not enriched
the countries where they are grown,
much less the peasants who grow
them. They have helped to degrade
the vegetation and hence to worsen
the threat of drought.
Population growth has forced the
Sahelian peoples to increase their
herds and to bring more land under
cultivation. In dry-year periods, over¬
grazing and renewed ground-clearing
activity are carried to danger point.
But people must live.

However, there has never been
enough investment in these marginal
regions. Wells have been dug, but
not enough of them, and they require
upkeep. Grazing land can be devel¬
oped, controlled and improved; but
little of this has been tried. Better use
can be made of water resources,
aquifers and, even more, rivers; but
their development often stops short at
the planning stage.
In this ebbing century, forecasting
is feasible. Through scientific studies
of natural and human conditions,
solutions can be found. But that
entails applying the will and the necess¬
ary means, before disaster strikes.

N this era of rapid commu¬
nication everyone is quickly informed
about meteorological disasters such
as floods, droughts, tropical cyclones
and tornadoes. Some disasters, such
as cyclones and tornadoes, are pre¬
dictable over a time span of a day
or so, so that precautions can save
life and property.
Other natural phenomena are more
insidious. Drought, for example, de¬
velops over months, seasons, and
sometimes years and causes even
greater human suffering through fam¬
ine and economic dislocations. Are
these insidious long-term disasters
predictable? If not, what is the hope
that they ever will be?
We are all aware of the ravages of
natural events of the recent past the
devastating Russian drought of 1972;
current drought in sub-Saharan coun¬
tries, especially Mali, Mauritania and
the Upper Volta, which seems to have
persisted and become aggravated in
the last few years; the occasional
seasonal droughts in parts of India
and Australia and the "Seca" or"
drought which occurs in some years
in northeast Brazil.
On the wet side, we have the
eastern U.S.A. floods in June, 1972,
associated, in part, with hurricane
Agnes the most costly storm in U.S.
history, and we remember the 1966
tragic flood of Florence. These are

but a sample of spectacular events
from the climatological record.
From time immemorial there have
been occasions when nature "goes on
a rampage" and makes it appear that
the climate is changing. Why does
nature do this? Unfortunately man
does not yet fully understand the
causes of these events, and therefore
he is unable to predict them reliably.
Yet meteorologists and climatolo-
gists have made great strides in study¬
ing them over the past few decades.
The World Weather Watch (WWW)
programme of the World Meteorologi¬
cal Organization (WMO) and comple¬
mentary (WMO - International Council
of Scientific Unions) Global Atmos¬
pheric Research Programme (GARP)
promises to bring much greater under¬
standing and perhaps reliable long-
range weather prediction (see articles
pages 4 and 21).
At present scientifically-based long-
range predictions are limited to a
month or, at most, to a season in
advance. These are general in nature
and mainly attempt to predict whether
precipitation over broad areas will be
above, below or near the long period
average (normal) and whether these
areas will have subnormal, normal or
above normal temperatures.
The methods used are, for the most
part, not precise enough to indicate
the beginning or ending of great
droughts, which span more than one
season and may last for years. Nei¬
ther are the methods precise enough
to forecast the record-breaking per¬
sistent rains which lead to floods.
Let us examine some of the known
factors associated with drought, for
this may give some idea of the com¬
plexity of long-term atmospheric be¬
haviour. The immediate cause of
drought is sinking motions of air mas¬
ses. These descending air motions, of
the order of a few hundred metres a
day, result in compressional warming
of the air since it is subjected to
increasing pressure in descent. This is
analogous to the heating of a bicycle
pump in use.
While the absolute quantity of
water vapour in an air parcel remains
unchanged in descent, the relative
humidity decreases because the capa¬
city for holding moisture has been
increased in the warmed air. In this
manner cloud formation is inhibited
or if clouds are formed, they are soon
dissipated.
The areas over which such sinking
air motion (called subsidence) prevails
may involve 5,000,000 square kilo¬
metres or an area as great as western
Europe. With ascent of air, cooling
leads to increase in relative humidity,
cloud and eventually precipitation.
The atmospheric circulations which
lead to this subsidence or ascent (the
"centres of action"), are linked to
horizontal wave patterns in the west
to east flow that prevails in temperate
latitudes. These wave patterns are
clearest at levéis between 3 and 15
km. above the earth.
Thus the westerly winds aloft are
usualJy contorted in the form of pole¬
ward or equatorward bulges (ridges
or troughs, respectively) great me¬
anders resembling the sine waves of
trigonometry. There may be five or six
such waves in a hemisphere at one
time. The sinking motion takes place
mainly in the ridges and the air
ascends in the troughs.
These planetary features can be
observed, of course, on any one day's
weather map, but they, also appear
even when maps are averaged over
a month, a season, and even a year
or period of years. The reason is
that a series of persistently recurrent
atmospheric systems, often of an ab¬
normal type, can dominate a specific
area. If these systems are ridges,
then the stage is set for persistent
subsidence of air masses, dryness
and drought; if troughs persist, the
stage is set for ascent of air, cloud
and rain.
The placement of these statistically
averaged troughs and ridges is not
chaotic; they are frequently arranged

air currents

atmosphere
Photo <D Vincent Schaefer, New York
In the upper reaches of the troposphere,
several miles above sea level, narrow
currents of fast-moving air flow in irregular,
meandering paths in an easterly direction
around the globe. The presence of these
currents was suspected early in this cen¬
tury, but it was the advent of high-flying
aircraft in the 1940s that confirmed the
existence of "jet streams" as these currents
are called. The strongest of these streams
occur in the middle latitudes. Over the
southern hemisphere they almost always
blow from dde west In the northern hemi¬
sphere the disturbing influence of the conti¬
nents causes some deviation and at times
they blow from west south-west over the
Atlantic and Pacific oceans and from the
west north-west over the continents of
North America, Europe and Asia. Above,

thern hemisphere. A jet stream generally

in patterns suggestive of a vast tele-
connective mechanism. In other
words, the position of one prevailing
ridge in the westerlies usually implies
troughs on either side and frequently
other ridges beyond these troughs.
This interrelationship is reasonably
well understood by meteorologists
both through theory and through em¬
piricism. But what factors cause one
or mere of the ridges or troughs? A
solution to this question would be a
major advance.
The present quest for reliable long-
range forecasting seems to narrow
down to two major possibilities, both
external to the atmosphere:
The abnormal waves in the west¬
erlies are in some unknown way gener¬
ated and maintained by extraterrestrial
events such as variations in solar
activity;
They are generated and main¬
tained by variations in the character
of the underlying earth's surface.
The latter possibility refers to chang¬
es in the amount of snow and ice,
mainly on the continents, and also to
the variable temperatures of the sur¬
face layers of the oceans. Both of
these surface features change much
more slowly than the restless over¬
lying atmosphere and thereby might
provide a "memory" so that persis¬
tently anomalous wind and weather
patterns are periodically restored.
Today's meteorologists are more apt
to espouse the second rather than
the first (extraterrestrial) hypothesis.
Many feel that we must first study,
as completely as possible, the terres¬
trial air-sea-land system before intro¬
ducing abnormal solar influences.
Of course, there exists another pos
sibility, which hopefully is not a prob¬
ability namely that the planetary
atmospheric wind systems are at the
whim of very small and immeasurable
forces so that chance alone deter¬
mines what form the atmosphere will
assume in the next month or next
season. Fortunately, meteorologists
have reason to believe that nature is
not playing dice with them.
In addition to the waves in the
upper westerlies, there are variations
in the latitudinal positions of these air
streams. Thus in some winters the
central core of the westerlies may be
10° to 15° of latitude farther south
than in others, so that storms prevail
in the sub-tropics while higher lati¬
tudes remain relatively storm free.
Such variations appear to be asso¬
ciated with big weather variations in
the tropics and even with hemispheric

9,000 to 12,000 metres- It usually blows
at about 190 km/h., but may attain speeds
of up to 500 km/h. Several distinct
currents of wind flow at differing speeds
along the axis of a jet stream with the
higher speeds occurring at the core of the
stream (see diagram right). The difference
in wind speeds along the axis of a jet
stream may be as much as 160 km/h. or
more. Occasionally a jet stream divides
into two main belts of very strong winds
a considerable distance apart. Jet streams
are of very great importance to aviation.
Modern aircraft often make use of these
powerful air currents. By "hitching-a lift"
in a jet stream an airliner can cut a long¬
distance flight time by nearly half with a
great saving in fuel. In weather forecast¬
ing jet streams are important because
certain types of storm occur most often
just beneath them. Left, high-flying cirrus

inter-actions between northern and
southern hemispheres. One of the
ideas to emerge during the past few
years is that the tropical atmosphere
is forced into abnormal behaviour by
variations in the underlying ocean
temperatures along the equator, and
that these variations, by complex
transports, mould the patterns of the
westerlies in mid-latitudes.
There is also some evidence to indi¬
cate that the tropical systems, includ¬
ing the ocean temperatures along the
equator, are frequently forced by
events in the middle and sub-tropical
latitudes. Most probably there are
interactions and "feedbacks" both
ways.
Thus the question of which comes
first, like the "chicken or the egg",
may not get a satisfactory answer.
But this need not stop progress in
long-range forecasting a subject re¬
plete with complexly coupled systems
of many kinds.
To return to some of the anomalous
weather events cited at the beginning
of the article, we find some evidence
for the following connexions: The Rus¬
sian drought of '1972 was associated
with a persistent and strong ridge aloft
in both summer and the antecedent
winter a ridge which may have been
initially engendered by a strong trough
affecting the British Isles, a strong ridge
in mid-Atlantic, and by anomalous sea
surface temperature patterns over the
North Atlantic (cold in the north, warm
in the south).
The sub-Saharan drought seems to
have been associated with a failure of
the intertropical convergence zone (the
tropical mechanism for lifting large
quantities of air) to move northward
in the rainy seasons this failure may
have been due to wind systems in tem¬
perate latitudes or elsewhere.
The Eastern U.S.A. floods associated
with hurricane Agnes, and perhaps the
wet soil left from preceding storms,
appears to have occurred in a vul¬
nerable trough area separating two
ridges the strongest of which lay in
mid-Atlantic.
This ridge was probably related to
the one immediately responsible for the
Russian summer drought.
The above conclusions are by no
means borne out by physical calcula¬
tions, but a world-wide effort by GARP
and WWW may result in development
of mathematical-physical models using r\
billions of observations and high-speed Jl I
computers to unravel the secrets of
what is probably the world's second
most difficult problem.

I OT without justification the
tropical cyclone has been described
as the greatest storm on earth.
Spawned over the warm waters of
the tropical oceans, cyclones have,
throughout the ages, taken a terrible
toll of human lives and created misery
and damage of unknown extent. In
the long catalogue of meteorological
disasters from which mankind suffers
they have been responsible for 80 per
cent of all the lives lost.
What is a tropical cyclone? It
may be broadly described as a large
vortex of air spiralling inward towards
the centre where the pressure is at
a minimum. This area, known as the
eye of the storm, contains only light
winds or may even be calm.
Around the eye explosive cloud
growth takes place as warm, moist
tropical air escapes upwards reaching
perhaps, above 12.000 metres. This
is the region of maximum winds
which in a mature storm may exceed
270 km. per hour.
The effects of the cyclone may be
felt over as much as 500 km. from the
eye, diminishing progressively in vio¬
lence away from the centre.
The meteorologist classifies them
according to their intensity, calling
PETER ROGERS is a specialist on tropical
cyclones at the World Meteorological Organ¬
ization. He has been c/ose/y associated with

caused by cyclones, in particular the pro¬
gramme of the typhoon committee of south¬
east Asian countries set up In 1968.
them tropical depressions with winds
up to 60 km. per hour, tropical storms
with winds up to 115 km. per hour
and hurricanes' at higher sustained
wind speeds. Considerable areas are
affected by violent winds and protract¬
ed heavy rains, causing extensive
flooding and damage.
For the layman there is often confus¬
ion between tropical cyolones, hurri¬
canes and typhoons. In fact all are
the same phenomenon; in the Carib¬
bean they are known as hurricanes
and in the north-west Pacific they are
termed typhoons. Tropical cyclones
also occur in the south-west Indian
Ocean, in the Bay of Bengal and the
Arabian Sea, and in parts of the
South Pacific, as well as around the
northern coasts of Australia.
History records many examples of
severe tropical cyclones causing
enormous loss of life and destruction.
We need not look back far because
what may have been the worst cyc¬
lone ever struck what is now Bangla¬
desh on the night of 12-13 November
1970.
The accompanying storm surge,
caused by low barometric pressure
and hurricane force winds, was fun¬
nelled into the head of the Bay of
Bengal by the converging coastline
and shallow waters. Its landfall almost
coincided with flood tide. The height
of the surge varied from 3 to 9 m. and
when it had swept over the offshore
islands and low-lying coastal belt
300,000 people lay dead.
Catastrophes of this magnitude in¬
variably arouse man's indignation. He
feels strongly that nature must be
tamed and not permitted to wreak its
havoc unchecked. Man has always
resisted the intemperate moods of
nature, too often vainly. Can we do
anything about tropical cyclones?
The answer to this question is an
emphatic "Yes".
Even though we may be far from
discovering how to tame their fury,
sensible precautions together with an
effective warning system save many
lives and limit damage. In fact it has
been estimated that at least 80 per
cent of the lives lost can be saved.
While the cost of damage shows
a steady upward trend in almost all
countries, much can still be done to
keep it to a minimum. For example,
a building code that increases the
cost of construction by only 6 per
cent can reduce damage by 60 per
cent for sustained winds up to 240 km.
per hour. It is not considered econo¬
mically feasible to build to protect
property against winds over 270 km.
per hour.
To achieve this calls for a sophisti¬
cated warning system and the closest
co-operation between all those with
responsibilities for community prep¬
aredness and disaster prevention, as
well as relief and rehabilitation. The
first step is, naturally, the detection,
tracking and forecasting of where the
cyclone will strike, and of its expected

Life-saving ' Killas '
Nearly half a million people lost their lives in the cyclone that
struck Bangladesh on the night of November 12/13, 1970. Many
of these lives could have been saved if communications had
been better and if the chain of artificial mounds known as "killas"
(opposite bottom) where men and cattle can take refuge in time
of flood, now being constructed with the help of the Red Cross,
had been in existence. Evidence of the formation of a cyclone
over the Bay of Bengal, moving rapidly north north-east, was
provided by photos such as the one above received from satellite-
ITOS 1 at 0957 hours on November 10, 1970. By then it was
apparently too late to alert the inhabitants of the scattered
villages of the low-lying, coastal regions of Bengal in time for
them to flee the huge tidal wave bearing down on them in the
path of the cyclone. With nowhere to run to (above) most of
the victims died of drowning. Material damage (below) was
immense, leaving the survivors deprived of their livelihood and
entirely dependent for many months on supplies flown in in a vast
international rescue operation (opposite top).

TROPICAL CYCLONES (Continued from page 52)
... much remains to be done to save lives
and reduce damage from typhoons
effects in terms of wind strength, rain¬
fall and flooding.
Earth-orbiting satellites, and more
especially geostationary satellites,
have largely relieved the meteorologist
of the difficult problem of detecting
the formation of a cyclone over dist¬
ant ocean waters from which he has
little other information. Precise posi¬
tioning of the cyclone centre some¬
times remains difficult but steadily
advancing technology should resolve
this problem.
Cyclone tracks are notoriously
erratic. In a 24-hour forecast, an
error of only 10° in predicting the
track results in the cyclone striking
the coast more than 185 km. from the
expected spot. Surveillance by satel¬
lite, by specially-equipped reconnais¬
sance aircraft and finally by 10 cm.
storm warning radar when the cyclone
is within 300-400 km. can ensure that
its path into the coast is closely moni¬
tored. Thus, a meteorological system
making. full use of modern technolo¬
gical aids is a prerequisite for the
accurate forecasting of cyclone move¬
ment and development and the issue
of accurate warnings.
B
56
UT the best forecast is
useless if nothing is done to act upon
it. There must be carefully prepared
and detailed national plans so that all
those responsible for the safety of
human lives and property know exactly
what to do when a warning is received.
Above all, it is vital that the warnings
reach everyone threatened by the
cyclone in good time; people must
also know how to protect themselves
and their property and fully understand
what the risks are.
A vigorous campaign of public edu¬
cation is the only means of achieving
this and must be repeated before each
tropical cyclone season if the lessons
learned are not to be forgotten.
There must be the closest co-opera¬
tion between the technical agencies
and those in the social welfare field
if the total system is to work effi¬
ciently.
The population cannot be success¬
fully protected from the 'onslaught of
a tropical cyclone if responsibilities
for different parts of the system are
broken down into separate, unco¬
ordinated parts.
Ultimately, the success or failure of
the warning system depends upon
its weakest link man himself. An
accurate forecast, a well-designed dis¬
aster prevention system, and all the
aids that technology provides count
for little if the human response is not
geared to the realities of the occasion.
Every cyclone brings forth a crop of
stories demonstrating the endless div¬
ersity of human reaction to the disas¬
ter threat. Age, health, education,
family situation, previous disaster
experience and many other factors
play a role, but a role so complex that
no clear-cut pattern of behaviour
emerges for general application to
future disaster situations. The aero¬
space engineer in Texas can be as
obstinate as the Bengali farmer in
refusing to leave his home when
advised to do so.
Few authorities have the power to
compel evacuation of danger areas.
And yet the pressures of increasing
population force people into low-lying
agricultural or coastal areas prone to
storm-surges. The potential for loss
of human lives is growing in many
cyclone areas and can only be re¬
versed by the remorseless application
of strict development controls. Very
little has so far been done in this
respect and even the planning of
satisfactory escape routes for evacua¬
tion is frequently neglected.
In some regions such as Bangla¬
desh, evacuation from low-lying
islands may not be feasible. There,
under a project sponsored by the
League of Red Cross Societies, "killas"
earthen mounds about 7 m. high
have been constructed to provide
refuge for the local population. Such
relatively simple measures can drastic¬
ally reduce the loss of life from
tropical cyclones, 90 per cent of which
is caused by drowning.
In spite of their violence, hurricane-
force winds account for relatively few
deaths. Flying objects propelled at
great speeds constitute the prime
menace but are easily avoided by
taking cover within a sound structure
until the danger is past.
The eye of the storm, with its light
winds, must not be taken as an indi¬
cation that danger is over. After a
short pause, the wind will blow with
renewed violence from the opposite
quarter. Here, the need for careful
education of the public is again evid¬
ent.
How are these measures being car¬
ried out in the 40-odd nations of the
world afflicted by tropical cyclones?
Obviously the problems have been
the same for many centuries but it is
only in recent times that man has rea¬
lized how much he can do to reduce
casualties and prevent the serious
inroads of cyclone damage into the
national economy.
In most countries a warning system
has grown up to face this age-old
menace but in many lands it is insuffi¬
ciently well-developed to be com¬
pletely effective. The World Meteoro¬
logical Organization began to take a
special interest in helping these coun¬
tries in 1966, in close co-operation
with the U.N. Economic Commission
for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE).
HE urgent need to reduce
the economic impact of typhoons
amongst the developing countries of
south-east Asia led to the setting up
of the Intergovernmental Typhoon
Committee in 1968. Seven countries
and territories (1) formed this Com¬
mittee with the avowed purpose of
conducting a joint programme to
accelerate action to reduce the loss of
life and damage caused by typhoons.
The programme encompasses meteo¬
rological and hydrological facilities
in the member countries to improve
the forecasting and warnings of ty¬
phoons, training and research, and
community preparedness and disaster
prevention to ensure that the public
are ready to meet the risks brought
each year by typhoons.
Five years have elapsed since this
programme began, bringing substan¬
tial improvements to the Typhoon
Committee countries. New technolo¬
gical aids, such as satellite read-out
equipment (APT), radar, telemetering
rain and stream-gauging equipment,
help in the fight to improve the pre¬
diction of typhoons and life-claiming
floods. Speedier telecommunications
permit the flow of vital data to all
interested countries, and the training
of national staff in the latest techniques
fosters increased awareness of the
ways in which science can help to
defeat the typhoon bogy.
In March this year, with the help of
the League of Red Cross Societies,
WMO and ECAFE sent a three-man
team to Hong Kong, Korea and Thai¬
land. Its object was to promote closer
co-operation between the various na¬
tional agencies active in pre-disaster

Korea, Laos, Philippines, Thailand.

planning and to prepare a programme
of further action. This enterprise was
the first of its kind and should do
much to stimulate a more co-ordinated
approach to disaster prevention.
These pioneering activities of the
Typhoon Committee soon evoked
growing attention in other tropical
areas. One direct consequence has
been the setting up of two other re¬
gional groups with closely similar
objectives one for the Bay of Bengal
and the Arabian Sea, and the other
for the south-west Indian Ocean.
Although they are only now beginning
their task, there are good grounds
for hoping that the regional appjpach
applied in the typhoon area will be
equally efficacious in these other
areas.
The tragic Bay of Bengal cyclone
of 1970 became the starting point for
a further focussing of WMO's efforts
on the cyclone problem. When soon
afterwards a series of typhoons rav¬
aged the Philippines causing further
heavy loss of life and massive dam¬
age, the Typhoon Committee appealed
to the United Nations General Assem¬
bly for international action. The
General Assembly reacted promptly
to this appeal, calling upon WMO to
mobilize scientists and resources to
discover ways of mitigating the harm¬
ful effects of these storms and of
removing or minimizing their destruct¬
ive potential.
WMO responded by setting up its
Tropical Cyclone Project. It then
assembled a group of international
experts in tropical cyclones to review
the state of forecasting, warning and
other needs for damage reduction, and
to define the objectives of the Project.
It next drew up a plan of action for
this long-term project. The plan
covers the detection and forecasting
of tropical cyclones, storm-surge and
flood forecasting, warning systems,
risk evaluation and disaster preven¬
tion and community preparedness, as
well as disaster relief, training and
research, and the development of
instruments and equipment.
If the best methods and techniques
available in the world are to be used
by all countries in their struggle to
reduce the impact of tropical cyclones,
a great many studies and much devel¬
opment work must be carried out. It
is an ambitious scheme in which the
topmost scientific talent in this field
must be given the resources to do
a job of profound humanitarian impor¬
tance.
Research into tropical cyclones has
been carried out in many countries
over a long period of years. Much
progress has been made but there is
a pressing need to harness the talents
of scientists in different lands for an
all-out attack on outstanding problems.
Only by the co-ordinated efforts of
many workers can these problems be
finally solved. One of the objectives
of the WMO Tropical Cyclone Project
is to foster this international effort
and to see that it is mainly directed
to saving human lives and improving
the quality of life by damage reduction.
It would be idle to deny that no
instant breakthrough can be expected.
The horrors caused by tropical cyc¬
lones have plagued mankind for cen¬
turies and it would be unrealistic to
think that they can be effaced over¬
night. We must plan for a long-term
programme, measured perhaps in
decades.
Whilst this essential work is going
on, it may confidently be expected
that steady progress in applying mod¬
ern technology to improving warning
systems through the various regional
programmes sponsored by WMO will
continue and will effectively benefit
many countries. M

Japan, the Philippines and other parts of East Asia are periodically
swept by typhoons and other natural disasters that take a heavy toll
of life and property. Effective warning systems are being set up in
different areas to meet the danger. Here, a storm signal is posted in
a street in Zamboanga on the island of Mindanao (Philippines). In this
warning system one siren blast means 50 to 90 km/h winds; two blasts
signifies 90 to 120 km/h winds.

HE time may come when
tomorrow's weather will be announced
with sure-fire certainly because by then
Man will make his own weather,
causing clouds and rain to appear and
disappear as he pleases.
Strangely enough this is how the
peoples of ancient times approached
the problems of meteorology, although
it was then believed that weather was
controlled by the gods who had only
to be invoked in order to change the
course of a storm or end a drought.
Such practices existed in all bygone
civilizations, from the shamans of the
Arctic who were reputed to control the
cold and the ancient peoples of Black
Africa with their tom-toms for calling
down the rain, to the rain-making sacri¬
fices shown in 3,000-year old pictures
discovered at Sumer in Asia.
Similar methods and beliefs also
existed in ancient China and Japan,
among the North American Indians and
the Aryans in India, the Greeks and
Romans, in short in all the countries
now represented in organizations and
authorities concerned with world
meteorology.
But in terms of ideas and research
ROGER CLAUSSE fsee biographical note on
page 43).
on the study of the weather, a world
of difference exists between these
ancient and outmoded practices and
the still tentative attempts being made
in our own time to influence the
weather.
Men learned first to observe pheno¬
mena in order to understand them.
Then, noting coincidences or instances
when the same phenomena were re¬
peated, they learned to distinguish the
laws, or rather regularities, linking
these phenomena together.
The first things that men observed
were naturally those around them, and
hence their observations and their
deductions were based on the behavi¬
our of plants and animals.
The weight which these deductions
carried and the wide credence which
they gained depended on the relation¬
ship between the village headmen or
elders who made them and their au¬
diences. The authority of the elders
(in days when they were listened to and
respected) gave their sayings the cha¬
racter of infallible pronouncements. It
is thus no wonder that, transmitted from
generation to generation with varying
degrees of distortion, these old saws
of weather wisdom have survived for
centuries.
At all events, we can take a look at
some of the ancient sayings, that cer¬
tain persons still accept without ques¬
tion, and try to distinguish between
what is clearly true or false in them,
though we cannot hope to explain cer¬
tain "mysteries" of the animal world.
Old almanacs going back nearly five
hundred years and manuscripts much
older still give impressive lists of
various symptoms of animal behavi¬
our presaging rain or the return of fine
weather.
It is quite true that animals, being
closer to nature than man and, unlike
man, not taking medicaments of all
kinds, have preserved a number of pri¬
mitive responses to natural phenomena
and to the various ways in which they
impinge on the living world.
Just as some species possess
instincts, probably based on sensorial
perceptions unknown to us, which
enable them to find their way back
over great distances to their seasonal
haunts or to detect the approach of
an enemy from far away, it is quite
likely that some animals are sensitive
to variations in atmospheric conditions
heralding changes in the weather. As
we shall see, men can also forecast
these changes by looking out for cer¬
tain clues.
Let us take a few examples of be¬
haviour in animals and even in plants
which are supposedly significant in re¬
lation to the weather. Right away, and
at the risk of seeming ignorant, we
have to admit we are not sure what to
make of the various sayings, often con¬
tradictory or perhaps too subtle
about the abilities of frogs and toads
to forecast fine weather or rain.
LCCORDING to one old
French saying:
"If toads caN today, the sun's on
the way".
But another saying goes:
"When toads loudly call, rain's sure
to fall."
Are the sayings really contradictory,
or does it take a keen musical ear to
distinguish between one kind of call
and another? In any case, a tame frog
kept in a bowl in a warm house is
hardly in contact with nature, and must
have lost any instinctive reactions to
the weather it may ever have had.

### 51769: Weather lore down the ages: a meteorologist discusses facts and fancies of traditional weather-wise sayings
"No one recognizes the
value of water until it
is lacking," says a
Spanish proverb. Right,
a young Mexican boy
drinking from a stream.
Before a shower of rain, certain kinds
of voles and field mice are supposed
to run about outside their burrows,
moles are supposed to scurry in and
out of their holes in agitation, wolves
howl, goats and rams butt each other,
donkeys bray and waggle their ears,
and pigs grunt and become restless
in other words, they all "feel the
bad weather coming on".
This agitated behaviour would be
understandable if the particular sensa¬
tions they felt really did herald storms
or rain, which are indeed no fun for
creatures dwelling in the open or in
burrows which can be flooded by sud¬
den downpours. But for this to be the
case, the animal "forecasters" would
have to be surrounded by a mass of
air possessing certain characteristics
announcing the change in the weather.
We now know, of course, that, the
weather for the next twenty-four
hours, at any given place, is in process
of formation at distances of hundreds
of kilometres around that place, and
that atmospheric changes occur only
shortly before the arrival of rain,
usually starting in the upper atmo¬
sphere.
Some factors may perhaps vary in
the preceding twenty-four hours, atmo¬
spheric pressure for instance (though
it seems fairly unlikely that animals are
sensitive to this) or gradual changes in
wind direction, sometimes also the
moisture content of the air or atmo¬
spheric electricity.
Since the atmospheric changes pre¬
ceding the approach of rain are so
complex and give so little clue as to
what the weather is going to be, and
especially as any of these changes can
occur without rain or storm following,
one can be pretty sure that the ways
in which animals behave are probably
due to a variety of causes; if their
behaviour sometimes precedes a
change in the weather, this is a mere
coincidence.
It is commonly believed that when
a cat rubs its paw behind its ear, it
means there will be rain. The cat itself
doesn't "mean" anything by its ges¬
ture: it rubs its ear because atmo¬
spheric electricity has changed, the
humidity has decreased, or simply be¬
cause it has an itch. But it is true
that felines are particularly sensitive to
changes in the magnetic field of the
atmosphere and become restless when
thunderstorms or snow are in the air.
Birds have always been regarded as
weather prophets. This reputation may
be due in no small measure to the great
bird migrations. Although the why
and how of these great movements are
still not fully explained, experts have
pointed out that some species, such
as swifts and storks, set off practically
on the same date every year, and that
the occasional slight differences of a
few days either way are connected
mainly with local variations in atmo¬
spheric conditions and in particular
with the availability of food small
insects or seeds but not with ap-

proaching changes in meteorological
conditions.
Swallows often die on the way south
in sudden cold snaps, such as the
snowstorm in Burgundy (France) in
October 1939 in which thousands of
these birds perished. Sea-gulls fleeing
inland may indeed be harbingers of the
storm provided the storm is going the
same way as they are; but it sometimes
happens that after sea-gulls have
prudently taken refuge from an Atlantic
gale on the banks of the Seine, the
sky in Paris remains clear while the
storm veers away towards Amsterdam.
Other instances of bird behaviour
which have been noted seem to be
connected with more immediate meteo¬
rological factors. Swallows flying low
are supposed to foretell rain, and
flying high, fair weather.
The explanation may be that convec¬
tion currents from the overheated
ground in fine weather carry up the
midges which provide the swallows'
food, whilst the general downward
movement of air masses preceding
rain keeps them close to the ground
and thus compels the birds to fly low.
On the other hand, the upward move¬
ments of air and convection currents
that cause the swallows to fly high
can, if they are strong enough, be
followed by rain or thunderstorms so
meteorology poses problems, even for
the birds.
In India, certain lizards are even re¬
puted to go into reverse when rain and
floods are in the offing, climbing trees
tail first. Throughout India, incident¬
ally, when popular sayings speak of
fine weather, rain is meant, drought
being reckoned as "bad weather".
OPULAR wisdom attribu¬
tes to creatures lower down the animal
scale a similar sensitivity to the appro¬
ach of bad weather: crayfish are sup¬
posed to leave their hiding places and
come out of their streams, dragon-flies
skim the surface of the water, snails
venture forth (especially after the
rain I) spiders spin their webs, fish
refuse to bite and stay near the sur¬
face ready to snap at the insects
which now fly low above it.
Is this behaviour due to changes
in atmospheric pressure or temperat¬
ure, which by acting on the oxygen
content of the water, make the fish
rise as the pressure falls, perhaps be¬
cause rain is on the way?
True or not, this belief is firmly held
by anglers for whom it provides an
additional excuse when they come
hone empty-handed, so let us not be
so rash as to challenge it.
Plants as well as animals respond
to the weather and its changes, hence
their reputation as weather forecast¬
ers. Their life-cycle is so closely
bound up with atmospheric conditions
that they can be taken as ready-made
devices for totalizing the climatic
variables.
The cycle of germination and vege¬
tation leaves, flowers, fruit
is controlled by rain, sun and tem¬
perature; by taking the. dates on which
different species flower, it is even
possible to draw up charts showing
the climatic conditions in different
areas in the preceding months.
But here we are dealing with direct
climatic effects, not the forecasting of
weather. At most, they make it pos¬
sible to reckon the probable date of
the harvest from the state of advance¬
ment of the crop, always provided that
weather conditions are normal in the
intervening months.
Thus, for instance, the fact that an
onion has many thick skins does not,
as some people claim, mean that it
will be a hard winter, but indicates
merely that certain conditions of heat
and dryness obtained while it was
growing, and statistically speaking,
next winter's weather bears no rela¬
tion to the weather in the preceding
seasons.
Plants are sensitive to immediate
local conditions of humidity, heat or
sunlight, and there is nothing myster¬
ious about the fact that the pimpernel,
the convolvulus or the daisy close
when the air becomes humid, although
this does not necessarily mean it is
going to rain.
The leaves of the artichoke, like the
scales of the pine cone, open in dry
weather and close in damp, but all
that this tells us is how humid the
air is, just as does the little man
with the umbrella who pops out of
the weather house when the hair to
which he is attached expands with the
dampness of the air.
In any case, even if all our doubts
were to be removed and our scepti¬
cism shown to be misplaced, even if
it were to be conclusively proved that
in a reasonable percentage of cases
these signs were reliable, what could
we learn from close observation of
the convolvulus, the toad or the
grooming habits of cats? It would not
in fact amount to very much.
At a more scientific level of obser¬
vation, we know for certain that a
halo, the bright ring sometimes seen
round the sun or moon, indicates to
the meteorologist the presence of
warm air at high altitudes, often the
prelude to rain.
Whereas human beings have few
instincts to alert them to weather chan
ges except for the aches and pains
which may start in wet or cold wea¬
ther what they do have are means
for observing and measuring the
atmospheric factors to which animals
and plants may unconsciously react.
Every day, thousands of meteorolo¬
gists, at stations equipped with radar,
barometers, hydrometers, thermome¬
ters, radiosonde balloons and even
receivers for picking up pictures sent
back by satellites of the clouds sur-

rounding the earth, measure with great
accuracy the same water vapour or
electricity in the air which disturbs
cats, the same variations in atmo¬
spheric pressure which bring fish to the
surface, the strength of the rising or
falling currents which makes swallows
fly high or low, and many other para¬
meters.
It must be admitted that the results
of these measurements, taken at some
10,000 different points around the
world, are much more reliable and
more readily usable than the purely
subjective reactions of animals. The
measurements can be transferred to
maps covering vast areas a quarter,
a half or even the whole of a hemi¬
sphere to give an overall picture of
world weather.
These maps help meteorologists to

### 51772: The Seasons of the Nile: a weather and farming calendar from the time of the Pharaohs
THE SEASONS
OF THE NILE
A weather and farming
calendar from the time
of the Pharaohs
by Abdel Moneim El Sawi
N_ J early 2,500 years ago,
the Greek historian Herodotus de¬
scribed Egypt as "the gift of the Nile",
and ancient proverbs confirm how
closely life in Egypt has, since ancient
times, been bound up with the Nile,
with agriculture and with the weather.
Throughout history, the Egyptian has
expressed his feelings about the
weather in sayings and proverbs that
are still in current use today. Egyptian
proverbs are often related to the
months of the year and the weather
appropriate to them and its effect on
the state of irrigation and agriculture.
ABDEL MONEIM EL SAWI is editor of the
Arabic edition of the "Unesco Courier",
published in Cairo, and is chairman of the
Unesco National Publications Centre in
Egypt. A former Under-Secretary of the
Ministry of Culture of the Arab Republic of
Egypt, he is well known in the Arab world
for his novels, essays and radio and
television programmes
For the ancient Egyptians the year
was divided into three seasons directly
related to the flooding of the Nile, the
stages of agriculture and the type of
crops and the weather. These seasons
were:
The season of planting.
The season of inundation.
The season of harvest.
The flooding of the Nile was of
paramount importance in the beliefs
of the ancient Egyptians. To them the
floodwaters of the Nile were a sea of
tears shed by Isis in mourning for her
husband Osiris.
Considered as a token of well-being
and prosperity, the floods were
celebrated at the festival of Wafaa
el-Nile (the faithful Nile) during the
second half of August (Misra to the
ancient Egyptians).
A painting from the time of Ram-
eses II (about 1290 B.C.) depicts, a
ceremony of the "Wafaa el-Nile" festival
at which the "Calf of Ibis", three geese
and valuable presents were thrown
into the Nile. Popular belief had it that
a bride was also thrown into the
waters of the river as part of this
ceremony, but this was no more than
superstitious rumour.
The year in Pharaonic Egypt, and
later in the Coptic calendar, was astral
and was connected with the star Sirius.
The ancient Egyptian year was consi¬
dered to begin on the first of "Toot"
(11th of September).
According to the Pharaonic almanac
the months of the year and the
prevailing weather were as follows:
Toot (11 September - 10 October):
attributed to T-hoot, god of wisdom and
science and father of astronomy and
geometry, it coincides with the
appearance of Sirius at dawn. The
Ist of Toot was also called the feast
of Nayrooz (the Persian New Year),
a feast celebrated by Egyptians up to
the time of Sultan Barkook (end 14th

SEASONS OF THE NILE (Continued)
century). Toot is considered the start
of the inundation period and one
proverb says "Irrigate in Toot or you
will be too late." It is thought to be a
bad time for the rearing of chickens
and the hatching of eggs. "Chicks of
Toot", runs one saying, "eat and die."
Baba (11 October - 9 November):
attributed to the god of agriculture
(Bee-net-ret). The floodlands dry out
after the inundation and winter crops
are harvested. During this month there
is the tempest of the big flood, which
lasts six days.
There is some wind and the first
signs of winter are seen. "Baba has
entered and has closed the roads",
says one proverb, meaning that
Baba is the time to close doors to
keep out the cold. "The bride of Baba
is blackened with smut", goes another
saying, expressing the view that this
month of change is an unsuitable one
in which to get married.
Hatoor (10 November - 9 December):
attributed to the gods of love, beauty
and heaven. The land becomes
verdant, the cold becomes more
intense and the Nile waters become
clear again after the floods. Hatoor is
connected with rain and the growing
of wheat: "Hatoor is the father of
scattered gold", and, "If you fail to
plant in Hatoor, wait till the coming
year." To fishermen and sailors this
is the beginning of the stormy season.
Kiyahk (10 December - 8 January):
attributed to the god of welfare
(Kahaka). The days shorten and the
nights lengthen: "In Kiyahk your
morning takes the place . of your
evening." . . . "You rise from your bed
only to look for your supper." It is a
month of frost and intenser cold and
tempests.
Tooba (9 January - 7 February):
attributed to the god Tobias the
Supreme, the god of rains. The end of
Tooba is marked by days of biting cold.
"Tooba makes the old woman crip¬
pled", says one proverb, stressing the
discomfort caused to the elderly by
the cold.
Amsheer (8 February - 9 March):
attributed to the god of tempests. Hot
winds cause buds to break into
blossom, but there are many tempests:
"Amsheer tells the small plants to
catch up with the big plants." "Am¬
sheer is the father of many tempests."
A changeable month, Amsheer has
days of biting cold and this has given
rise to one of the most common
proverbs: "The name is that of Tooba,
but the act is that of Amsheer."
Baramhat (10 March - 8 April): Beans
ripen, the mulberry trees are green,
silk worm eggs hatch out and ears of
corn appear. It is the beginning of
spring: "In Baramhat go to the fields
and get what you want." It is marked
by the last and most violent tempest of
the year, the two-day "howling tem¬
pest": "There is no tempest like the
howling tempest."
Barmouda (9 April - 8 May): attri¬
buted to the sacred snake, Remoota,
the goddess of harvest. In this month
wheat and flax are harvested, honey
is gathered and bees multiply. As this
is the harvest season one saying goes:
"In Barmouda strike the shafts", which
means strike the stems of flax to
extract its fibres and thresh the corn.
Bashans (9 May - 7 June): attributed
to the god of light. Days become
much longer than the nights, the
temperature rises and there is virtually
no rain. This was the dry season when
the Nile was at its lowest and the land
was bare and cracked after the harvest.
In the past it was said: "Bashans
sweeps the ground completely." The
picture has now changed, however,
with various irrigation schemes and
the construction of the Aswan High
Dam.
Ba-oona (8 June - 7 July): attributed
to the god Khenti, god of minerals.
Ba-oona means stone and during this
month Egyptians used to leave their
fields and turn to mining and the
building of houses and temples. The
11th of Ba-oona (17 June) is called
"The Night of the Drop", because it
was believed that a divine teardrop
fell from heaven to cause the coming
of the floods.
Abeeb (8 July - 6 August): its name
is derived from that of the god of
happiness, Habi, to mark the coming
of the floods. The floodlands are
opened to receive the floodwater and
the grapes become sweeter as they
drink up the Nile water and fruits
generally ripen: "Abeeb, the cook of
grapes and raisins."
Misra (7 August - 5 September):
attributed to Misra the Sun, or the
child of the sun. The temperature
drops as a prelude to winter. It is the
season of floods and water. Summer
fruits become ripe, dates, figs and
grapes become abundant: "Misra is
the month in which each difficult canal
runs."

where storms are raging, how the cur¬
rents which carry them along move,
which regions are likely to suffer
cyclones and which are likely to have
flat calm and mists.
Taking into account this up-to-date
information on what is happening bet¬
ween ground level and an altitude of
25 to 40 km., together with the physi¬
cal laws and rules governing the at¬
mosphere, they can foresee the air
currents for the next day and follow¬
ing days, pinpoint the cloud masses
and the rain, in short, forecast the
weather.
For some time now, they have been
able to do even better. The number
of instrument readings going to make
up the overall weather picture is so
great, and the equations needed to
calculate their significance are so
complicated that it would take all the
meteorologists in the world several
months to work out the data required
for one twenty four-hour forecast. Big
modern computers, however, once
they have been programmed to un¬
derstand the laws of the atmosphere,
can process all the information in an
hour.
Bemusing, certainly, for those who
base their weather forecasts on hints
gleaned from plants or animals.
Though, during the process of civi¬
lization, man may have lost some of
his natural "instruments", he has re¬
placed them with scientific methods
that tell him far more accurately whe¬
ther or not it will be fine tomorrow.

or teachers. Illiterate draftees will go as
students to the literacy centre nearest to
their unit and those not required for the
forces will attend classes part time during
the regular 11 -month period of military
service.
Everything
under the sun
A Unesco-sponsored congress on "Sun
in the Service of Mankind", the largest
of its kind ever held, recently brought 600
scientists to Unesco's Paris H.Q. Embrac¬
ing three major themes Sun and Life,
Sun and Energy and Sun and Habitat
studies and discussions ranged over
almost "everything under the sun", from
solar power plants and home cookers to
the effects of sunlight on plants and
animals.
No place like home
for accidents
Accidents are one of the three leading
causes of death in many countries, with
accidents in the home accounting for a
large proportion of fatalities, says a World
Health Organization report. In the U.S.A.,
during a single year, 20 million people
were injured in domestic accidents five
times more than the number injured on
the roads. The most common causes of
home accidents are falls and burns.
India's women
book-lovers
In India more women than men read
books says a survey by the Indian Natio¬
nal Book Trust. The survey also reveals
that 60 per cent of readers buy books
and the rest borrow from libraries or
friends. India is one of the world's major
book-producing countries (its national
bibliography lists an average of 11,200
titles annually) but its total production
still represents only 23 titles per million
of its population, as compared with 418
per million people in Europe.
International response
to Borobudur appeal
Australia has contributed over $283,000
and India has pledged $66,000 worth of
goods and services for the preservation
of the ancient Buddhist sanctuary of Boro¬
budur in Indonesia. Other countries which
have responded to Unesco's appeal for
help in restoring Borobudur include Bel¬
gium, Cyprus, France, Fed. Rep. of Ger¬
many, Iran, Japan and the Netherlands.
New look at history
and geography
Several countries have recently taken
a fresh look at their history textbooks
with the aim of removing stereotyped
images and age-old prejudices concern¬
ing their neighbours. Co-operation bet¬
ween Unesco National Commissions in
Austria and Italy has led to the publication
of a history book with a new approach,
"Austria and Italy", (1) which tells the
story of relations between the two coun¬
tries with candour and objectivity. Text¬
books incorporating a new view of Germa'-
and Polish history from which prejudiced
accounts have been eliminated are about
to appear, following meetings organized
by the Fed. Rep. of Germany and Polish
National Commissions for Unesco. Educ¬
ators from the German Fed. Rep. and
from Romania have proposed changes for
improving how each country is presented
in the other's geography books.
(1) 'Austria and Italy", by S/fWo Furlani and Adam
Wondruszka, published in German by Jugend und
Verlagsgesellschaft, Vienna and Munich, and in
Italian by Casa Éditrice L. Cappelli, Bologna.
African H.Q. for U.N.
environment programme
Nairobi, Kenya, has been selected as
headquarters for the new U.N. Environ¬
ment Programme which was launched
following last year's U.N. Stockholm
Conference on the Human Environment.
The programme, endorsed by the U.N.
General Assembly last December, inclu¬
des an "Earthwatch" pollution monitoring
system, an international computerized ser¬
vice for environmental information and a
"gene-bank" for conserving threatened
plant species. A 58-nation governing
council will oversee U.N. work on protec¬
tion of the environment.
Cuban stamps
aid Venice
Cuba's Ministry of Communications has
issued a special series of three stamps
as a contribution to the Unesco-sponsored
international campaign to save Venice.
Bearing the inscription, "Pro Venecia
Unesco", the stamps portray two famous
landmarks in Venice, the Bridge of Sighs
and the Cathedral of St. Mark (shown
below) and the winged lion emblem of the
former Venetian Republic.

Letters to the Editor
SHREWD INSIGHT
Sir,
Bravo for Marcel Hicter's shrewd and
penetrating article "Drugs and Society",
in your May 1973 issue. For the first
time I find the problem of drugs exa¬
mined in its proper context: present-
day society in which youth is not
always guilty and adults are not always
innocent.
Serge Guerot
Villebon-sur-Yvette, France
SCIENCE AND MYTH
Sir,
Your issue on "Science and Myth"
(February 1973) is a timely step towards
the debunking of beliefs which tend to
make some people accept myths that
are contrary to the laws of science.
This is true of all myths. They are
simply legends concocted with a basis
of historical or scientific fact and pre¬
sented to the public as factual or
religious truths.
The more science broadens our hori¬
zons, the better we become aware of
the false reasoning on which religions
are based, even though they all have
a foundation of morality and of social
laws and custom.
Congratulations too for your issue
"The Emergence of Man" (August-Sep¬
tember 1972). Its examination of the
question of the origins of man on the
basis of scientific fact was a first step
towards the démystification of this
subject.

CARTHAGE. LIVING SYMBOL
OF THE PAST
Sir,
I am 18 years of age and a college
student. Just recently I read about the
project to save the ruins of Carthage.
(See also "Carthage must not be des¬
troyed", "Unesco Courier", December
1970.) I don't know if my letter will
help much, but ¡t is my way of showing
you that I am concerned too.
I have never been to Carthage, but
I have been to Rome and to Ostia
Antica, in Italy, and they impressed me
more than anything else I have ever
seen. The sheer power and beauty of
those ruins have impressed me ever
since, and I often think of them. To
destroy any such ruins is a crime
against humanity. These ruins are not
just ruins; they have inspired artists,
writers, and poets, of all ages, and for
some people like me they bring to life
that great period of our past like
nothing else can. I have stood in the
ruins of the Colosseum for 1J hours,
just imagining how it was then. I would
hate to see the ruins of another great
city, such as Carthage, destroyed.
It would be different if these ruins no
longer gave anyone inspiration, a sense
of beauty or the past, or any answers.
The fact is, we still gather inspiration
and the sense of beauty and past, we
are still finding answers to our past
history and we are still learning from
these. To me, the beauty, impressive-
ness, and uniqueness of the ruins are
reasons enough for not destroying
them. Too many people don't stop to
think In the rush of progress, that all
of the things we get from these ruins
of our past, once destroyed, can never
ever again be replaced. It would be
one of the great idiocies of our time
if they were covered over in the con¬
crete of "progress".
I hope that your efforts to save them
will be rewarded, and for all of us who
are behind you please don't stop trying.
As Macaulay wrote: "People who take
no pride in the noble achievements of
remote ancestors will never achieve
anything worthy to be remembered with
pride by remote descendants."

OUR WINDMILLS WERE TILTED
Sir,
I was delighted to see that your
interesting issue "Music of the Centu¬
ries" (June 1973) marked the cente¬
nary of Fedor Chaliapin. But I was
surprised to read in the caption accom¬
panying the photo of the great bass
(page 14) that it showed him in the
title role of Richard Strauss' "Don
Quixote". The "Don Quixote" compos¬
ed by Richard Strauss in 1898 was a
work for 'cello and orchestra and
therefore could not have been sung by
Chaliapin.
Works based on Cervantes' famous
character have been written by a score
of composers Including Purcell, Conti,
Salieri, Von Dittersdorf, Massenet and
Pierné.
Jules Massenet's "Don Quixote", first
performed at the Monaco Opera House
in 1910, provided Chaliapin with one
of his most striking roles. Later, in
1934, Chaliapin appeared as Don
Quixote in a film directed by G. W.
Pabst, though this was not an adapt¬
ation of Massenet's work. Commission¬
ed to write the score, Ravel eventually
withdrew, but not before he had written
his admirable "Three songs of Don
Quixote to Dulcinea". The film score
was ultimately written by Jacques Ibert
and it is more than likely that your
photo is a still from this film.

A MATTER OF RELATIVITY
Sir,
Why all this controversy about whe¬
ther the sun goes round the earth or
vice versa (Letters to the Editor, June
1973) following Jean-Claude Pecker's
article "Copernicus as told to children"
(April 1973) issue.
Did you not know that / am the
centre of the Universe (my Universe)?
As I sit here, I feel that / am still, and
everything else moves round me or
towards me or away from me.
But I know that you are the centre
of your universe and so long as I
recognize this and you recognize that I,
also, am the Centre, we shall not
quarrel or come to any harm from each
other.
Everything will be O.K. for both of us.
It Is all a matter of relativity!

RASH ASSERTIONS?
Sir,
I would like to comment on the
article "Copernicus as told to children"
by Jean-Claude Pecker, in your fascin¬
ating issue on Copernicus (April 1973).
There are those who still share not
only Copernicus' love of science but
also his religious faith. I'm sure Coper¬
nicus would have been unhappy to read
in Prof. Pecker's article that "One
day... we'll have to admit that the old
(Biblical) legends were lovely stories
and perhaps nothing more". The Bible
stories of the Creation are not
"legends", but myths writings full of
imagery (with no pretensions to being
scientific) and expressing a religious
truth.
And isn't It rather rash to assert that
"Man is a highly developed animal,
but in the universe there must certainly
be others even more highly developed"?
I question this statement not on reli¬
gious grounds but on the basis of
existing scientific data. Shouldn't we
be more circumspect about the possi¬
bility that other planets, Identical or
similar to the earth and Inhabited, exist
in other galaxies?

TOO MANY ACCIDENTS
Sir,
In recent years the "Unesco Courier"
has dealt at length with two burning
issues of world health cardiovascular
disease (April 1972) and cancer (May
1970).
World Health Organization surveys
show that accidents are another crucial
issue which needs to be spotlighted.
Accidents have become a modern
scourge and their prevention is now a
leading social problem. Though acci¬
dent figures in the U.S.S.R. are lower
than in many other countries, the
problem is no less pressing here.
All countries are undoubtedly focuss¬
ing their attention on this question. It
would be interesting to read about their
various approaches, achievements and
plans, and to have the opinions of
experts who study the causes of acci¬
dents. The prevention and elimination
of accidents equally concerns research
establishments, design offices, sociolo¬
gical laboratories, factories, transport
organizations and medical institutes. It
would also be stimulating to hear what
philosophers have to say on this
subject.
Victor Degtyarev
Moscow, U.S.S.R.
The Unesco Courier devoted an
entire issue (April 1961 "Accidents
Need Not Happen") to the subject of
accidents and their prevention. See
also "Unesco Newsroom" in our current
issue Editor.

Drought over Africa
This young African, eagerly slaking his thirst with a trickle
of water from a gourd, is one of millions today suffering
the catastrophic effects of a drought that stretches across
the African continent from Mauritania on the west coast
to the Sudan in the east. During the past seven years, declin¬
ing rainfall in this immense area of Africa south of the
Sahara has destroyed crops, decimated herds and forced
untold numbers of persons into an unprecedented migration
in search of food and water (see article page 44).
