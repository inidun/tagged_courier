FEAR BEHIND THE BARS. The "insane asylum" surrounded by bars and high walls which not so long
ago was still defended because mentally ill patients were feared and believed to be Incurable, tends to disap¬
pear as methods of treatment are developed. When a traditional "insane asylum" in the Philippines began
to be transformed, and iron bars and grilles were removed, many patients at first thought they were about to
be abandoned because the bars had become a protective symbol against a world that had treated them badly.

COVER PHOTO
Few people today escape the effects of
tensions arising from experiences with
family and friends, job and community,
and which provoke feelings of uncertainty,
apprehension or fear. Problems get too
big to handle and many people react to
such situations by becoming mentally ill
to such an extent that they need treat¬
ment in a psychiatric hospital. Modern
therapy, however, has made it possible
for most patients to resume their place
in society. See page 1 8," Return Home".

The greatest public health problem In the world today
is mental ill health. It fills more hospital beds than
cancer, heart disease and tuberculosis combined. For
every patient in a mental hospital at least two others are
living outside, neither sick enough to be hospitalized nor
well enough to live a healthy, happy life.
Figures are not available on the total amount of mental
disorder in the world, but in countries with well-developed
health services about half the number of hospital beds
are occupied by psychiatric cases, and one third or more
of the out-patients at large general hospitals attend for
complaints traceable to psychological causes.
In Europe nearly two million people are in hospital with
mental illness. In the U.S.A. 600,000 are hospitalized, and
one person in sixteen suffers from some form of persona¬
lity disturbance. In the Netherlands roughly 35 university
students in 1,000 need some kind of psychological or psy¬
chiatric attention. Japan, Denmark, Austria and Switzer¬
land lead the iworld in the number of suicides, while
France consumes 10 times more alcohol proportionately
than the U.S. or Sweden and 5 times more than Great
Britain.
"If the amount of bodily disease in the world reached
the proportions of many of the existing social ills with
mental and emotional causes (delinquency, alcoholism,
drug addiction, suicide, etc.) not to mention classical men¬
tal disease, an epidemic state would be declared and
strong measures taken to combat it." This striking state¬
ment made at a WHO seminar a few years ago is equally
true today.
The increase in mental ill health now involves whole
populations. Fortunately it has been accompanied by
. remarkable progress in treatment and a better under¬
standing for the strains and stresses that affect everyday
behaviour. Most of us in fact, at some time in our lives,
suffer from minor troubles that mar our happiness, disor¬
ganize our social and family life or affect our capacity
for work. We must realize that many of the problems
of modern living are in fact mental health problems
problems of nervousness, fear, lack of courage, intolerance,
prejudice and impulsiveness.
It is important that people everywhere should open
their eyes to the facts of the present mental health
situation and its underlying causes. This is one of the
chief objectives of World Mental Health Year 1959-60,
sponsored by the World Federation of Mental Health and
supported by WHO, Unesco and governmental and non¬
governmental societies throughout the world.
World Mental Health Year (WMHY) »was launched last
month on World Health Day, and like the International
Geophyscial Year will continue for 18 months with an
international programme of research and inquiry and a
broad campaign of public information and education.
centuries when mentally sick people were regarded
simply as "lunatics" who had to be locked up in institu¬
tions or even chained in prisons, society is slowly losing
its terror of mental disease and is coming to regard it
as curable like other sicknesses. If treatment is begun
early enough about 80% of mental patients can now
look forward to being cured and can take their place
once again in society.

### 65232: I was a mental patient
by Hervé Bazin
Académie Goncourt
IAM in no way a specialist in mental health but simply
a writer, one of whose books, Head against the Wall,
recently filmed, tells of the life of a psychopath under
the old asylum system. In 1955 I also carried out an
investigation into the state of psychiatry and psychiatric
hospitals in France for a French magazine. But it would
be idle to pretend that I have not got compelling
reasons for my interest in matters of mental health. For
I was a mental patient myself, and I can remember how
it feels to be swallowed up in a living death even if I
cannot give full expression to the compassion I feel for
those who have not yet awakened from that long night.
It may seem strange that an ex-inmate, even though
now a member of the Goncourt Academy, should under¬
take a tour of Europe for WHO twenty years later. Yet
it is, rather, a guarantee of the seriousness of the man,
whose pride still bears a scar, and who looks on his
brethren and seeks to assess a scourge that strikes at our
very nature, at reason the prime privilege and charac¬
teristic of man and that every day seems more truly to
be the price (we must pay for progress.
Forgive me for this all too personal preamble. Set your
mind at ease; it is not the purpose of this enquiry to
terrify the reader or to exhibit the horrors of the snake-
pit; it is rather to arouse and draw attention to a
problem as serious as that of cancer, of which it is a sort
of image in the mind. Above all, the purpose is to show

Goncourt Academy in France. His books (a million-and-a-half
copies printed in France) are translated in 19 languages.
that the answers to this problem have almost all been
found and that tremendous efforts are being made.
It is true that there are two million mentally sick
persons in Europe, and equally true that some 40 to 50
per cent of hospital beds are occupied by them; but such
impressive overcrowding and enormous cost have one
merit at least: as so often happens when the pressure
becomes too great, the authorities, spurred on by the
medical profession, have now been roused. Psychiatry has
developed and outgrown the pathetic and the custodial
system: new techniques have relegated the madman to
the old wives' tales, and the idea of the lunatic as a
danger to society and therefore best locked up behind
solid walls has gone out of fashion.
Mental illness is still a danger to society, but mainly to
its pocketbook. Frugal authority has come to understand
that curing patients is the cheapest way of having none.
Moreover, with the gradual spread of social equity and
what might be called a policy of happiness, moral pressure
has become too great for society any longer to tolerate
the old asylum, that discreet variation on the leper colony.
A quarter of a century ago it already had been rechristen-
ed the psychiatric hospital, but the change was a change in
name alone, although it was an indication of the uneasy
conscience which gave rise to modern psychiatry.
There is also no doubt that this forward movement has
been hastened by the war and by the horrors of the
concentration camps, of which the asylums were almost
the peacetime reflection.
It is not long since the days when Hitler was organiz¬
ing the massacre of the mentally deranged; yet today
there is not a country in Europe where psychiatry is
considered a luxury, and almost all have gone a great deal
further, realizing that prevention is better than cure and
attacking the causes. The fact that those causes are
largely to be found in society itself may not simplify
matters but it does show clearly which way to move. The
problems of mental ill-health require more than the
treatment and care of the certified; they also require pre¬
ventive measures. It is now realized not only that delin¬
quency, suicide and alcoholism properly belong to the
realm of psychiatry, but also that conjugal and family
misunderstandings, "'emotional under-nourishment", bad
upbringing, difficulties or instability at work, and even a
certain proneness to misfortune are all part of a closely
allied realm, constantly merging into the psychiatric, and
. that the risk of passing from the one into the other can
almost be calculated mathematically.
Mental health, in short, depends on a complicated

REPLACE APATHY
WHO photos by Eric Schwab
Between the old "insane" asylum with its locked doors, high walls and custodial role and the modern
mental hospital run as an "open" therapeutic community lie a world of changes. None is more
striking than the transformation of the atmosphere in which each patient, after receiving the special
care he or she requires, can readjust gradually. to life with the aid of group therapy and other
therapeutic activities. Dancing (top, opposite page) is not merely a distraction, but enables
patients to mingle, to laugh together and enjoy themselves. At the Philippines Mental Hospital,
where these photographs were taken, a patients' band plays daily in the different pavilions
and professional bands (bottom, opposite page) play regularly for patients in the big courtyard.

(Continued)
balance of physical, moral and social factors for which
we are all jointly responsible. Under the aegis of WHO
this joint responsibility has become an international
concern. Through the exchange of information and
methods one country is spared the pains of experimenta¬
tion in one field while making available to others the
fruits of its knowledge in a different one, and the most
effective action can be taken in the shortest possible time.
Mental health in Europe is now a matter of common
endeavour, more or less advanced, more or less successful,
according to local needs and resources. That is what I
travelled in ten countries to see.
The first point to be made is the difference between
the northern and southern countries. The most
pressing problems seemed to be in England and
Holland but, because they were the most pressing, the best
solutions were also found there. The general aging of
the population, which stands to the credit of a country
but burdens it with senile psychoses, and a low infant
mortality rate, which means that the weak and con¬
sequently those predisposed to all forms of deficiency are
saved, are combined there with the well-known effects of
industrial concentration, with technical demands which
increase the number of unstable and maladjusted persons
and with a less tolerant attitude among city-dwellers with
ever-narrowing concepts of what is normal.
Here, too, sufferers from the milder forms of mental
illness, who accept their state more readily, come forward
more willingly and a great deal is done for them. The
people also demand more out of life and think more of
themselves in those countries, such as the Scandinavian,
where they enjoy great social advantages, and where the
natural combati.veness of the individual and his resistance
to stress are lowered.
The Latins, like the Greeks, Turks and Yugoslavs, are
a more agricultural, less urban people, and the
difficult or defective old person is more easily
absorbed within the family structure. It is not surprising,
therefore, that in those countries with the exception of
France the figures for mental illness are lower. At the
same time, it should be noted that the figures for the
industrial complex of Milan are twice those of Sicily, that
the true picture is easily clouded by a lower rejection rate
and poorer casefindlng, that a lack of hospitalized patients
often means no more than a lack of hospitals, and that
the care of the aged is of relatively little importance in
countries where the life expectancy is short in Yugoslavia
it is 40 years. In these countries it is rather a matter of
starting lower on the ladder and catching up with the
northern countries, whose rate of advance is decreasing.
The second point to be made is that in addition to
the variations in the frequency and distribution of
mental illnesses, there are also variations in kind.
These are being actively studied but the data are
manifold and their appraisal difficult. Alcoholism in
France and suicide in Denmark are now, somewhat im¬
properly, part of popular legend; and, despite what lit¬
erature would seem to teach, no man can truly assert that
the Englishman is particularly predisposed to schizo¬
phrenia, the German to paranoia or the Slav to
depressions. For any group the determining factors are
both varied and variable. All we can say at this moment
is that the environment is assuming greater importance
than genetics. Man's ills are determined not by man but
by the human condition and they are much the same
wherever they arise.
Since each country has its own background and its own
current of thought a more sensitive indicator of national
differences is to be found in the various ways in which
the problems of psychiatry have been approached. But
these differences are theoretical rather than practical and
should not be exaggerated; although one tendency may
predominate here and another there, all are to be found
in every country. Since each school has its areas of failure,
and since psychiatry is not an exact science but an art
depending largely on the initiative of the practitioner,
the combination of very different methods has become
almost the general rule. And very effective it is.
Let us briefly consider these combined methods. The
recent introduction of the psychotropic drugs (both

COUNTRY CLUB FOR PATIENTS
The "country club" atmosphere on this page is no accident, for the
Cassel Hospital for Functional Nervous Disorders, founded in 1921
by Sir Ernest Cassel, occupies what is literally a converted country
club at Ash House near Stoke-on-Trent in England. The hospital
with its pleasant grounds (1) also serves as a training centre for nurses
studying modern mental therapy illustrated here (2) by a game of croquet
only a pastime but also a way of giving patients an opportunity
to learn much-needed concentration and co-ordination. This same
atmosphere can be found in the hospital's dining room (3) where care¬
fully-planned meals are served in surroundings more reminiscent of
a comfortable inn than an Institution. The process of re-adaptation
to normal life Is also encouraged by the lounge (4) of the hospital
where patients can relax after supper (every evening, a nurse acts as
"hostess" to steer conversation into constructive paths). Another
important step In breaking down the barrier between the world of mental
illness and reality is occupational therapy. Patients shown here (5)
are engaged in weaving, braiding wood-carving and model-making.
Their studio is a cheerful room right next to the hospital's ballroom

I WAS A MENTAL PATIENT (Continued)
ALL OF US HAVE A BREAKING POINT, and the increasing
tensions to which we are subjected can seriously affect our
mental well-being, according to Dr. W.C. Menninger, (See
article, page 16), President of the Menninger Foundation, a U.S.
non-profit centre for research, treatment and prevention in the
psychiatric field. Photos show patient at the Philippines National
Mental Hospital in the throes of anger and uncontrolled emotions

stimulating and tranquillizing) was an important event,
which seemed almost to bring final victory within
reach. But, in addition to the fact that in certain
cases these drugs are contra-indicated, their abuse can
lead to addiction and to undesirable personality changes.
They have, however, made it possible to put a stop to
aggressiveness and agitation, to work in a relaxed atmos¬
phere, and to institute faster and deeper treatment on
a better disposed subject. But in the task of rebuilding
no pharmacopoeia can take the place of lucid will power.
The treatment, of course, depends on the case. The
horror films have popularized, often absurdly, the notion
of treatment by electric shock which, in fact, is suitable
for a limited number of conditions only. There is also
a whole range of other shocks (produced, for instance,
by insulin or cardiazol) intended for more or less the same
purpose to plunge the patient into an artificial coma so
that he may recover his sense of reality on awakening.
There is the sleep cure in which the patient's nervous
functions are completely rested, and narcotherapy which
seeks to undo his complexes. There is the much-debated
psychosurgery, which by severing certain links or cutting
off certain areas of the brain may overcome serious trou¬
bles but generally leaves the patient handicapped.
I shall not go into all the other methods, most of which
are used not singly but in combination one with another.
The real innovation, bringing together and capping all
the others, is the complete transformation of the atmos¬
phere of the psychiatric clinic. The locked doors, the high
walls, the measures of coercion are going, and with them
the shackles on the patient's freedom and the attacks on
his personal dignity. These are being replaced by open
therapeutic communities where, in addition to receiving
the special care he requires, each patient can readjust
himself gradually to life in society through group therapy
and to his work through therapeutic activities; this is
followed by trial release, and finally by a probationary
period and follow up.
The results of these policies are beginning to make
themselves felt and in direct proportion to the degree
of improvement achieved. It used to be said that
few mental patients could be cured; it is known now
that very few cannot be cured if action is taken quickly
and the patient is not allowed to entrench himself in his
illness. Not a third of the inmates of the old asylums
returned to the world; nowadays model institutions
discharge 80 per cent, or more of their patients after a
few months or a few weeks instead of keeping them to
rot for years. In spite of the increasing numbers under¬
going mental treatment, these accelerated cures, are

but the family refused to consider this. Finally after much dis-

reducing the overcrowding, which used to move in a
vicious circle further to retard final rehabilitation.
Moreover, wherever it has been possible to attack on all
fronts, the result has been a general cleansing of the
public mind, a lowering of tension, and a good start
towards the eradication of the social vectors of mental
diseases; and in such privileged places, the reduction in
these diseases has been parallelled by social progress.
Alas ! few places are so privileged; much has still to be
done. According to one English psychiatrist, even in
England, a leading country, "one-third of the hospitals are
good, one-third passable, and one-third poor."
Elsewhere the ratio is worse, particularly deep in the
provinces, where the hospitals may be a century out of
date; in some places, they are still in the Middle Ages.
But let us not yield too easily to indignation at this
slowness, the economic and historical foundations of
which are beginning to crack and which does at least have
the merit of allowing those who have fallen behind to
catch up without having to learn and unlearn out-dated
methods whose quasi-superiority breeds stubborn pride.
It is unfair to draw a comparison with the best that
exists elsewhere rather than with what one used to
have. The important fact is that all European psychiatry
is on the move, and with it the health of the mind.
Let it not be forgotten, too, that every country has had
its contribution to make. It was at Gheel, in Belgium,
that long, long ago the disciples of St. Dymphna first took
pity on the insane. It was in Spain that St. John of God
built the first asylum. Electric shock therapy was the work
of an Italian, Cerletti; insulin treatment of an Austrian,
Sakel; lobotomy of a Portuguese, Moniz. The work of the
Russians on conditioned reflexes; of the Germans on
genetics; of the French on drugs and the pathology of the
brain; of the English, of the Dutch, of the Danes and of
countless others, constitutes one whole in which the
knowledge of some is matched by the wisdom of others,
often more skilled in the practical application.
In a world ominously divided the common struggle
towards better health is a comforting phenomenon,
and the efforts being made to improve the health of
the mind are not the least part of it. The situation is
still serious, there can be no doubt of that, but a
"controlled optimism" is nevertheless permissible, for
here, above all, man is at grips with himself. There may
never be a vaccine against mental disease, but prevention
may yet give a large measure of immunity to organized
society, which the adage mens sana in corpore sano must
be extended to include.

THE MOST
CURABLE,

OF ALL
DISEASES
by Dr P. Sivadon
When, as a student, I told my teachers that I wanted
to specialize in psychiatry, one of them, a well-
known clinician with a large private practice,
exclaimed: "You aren't serious? Mental cases are scarce;
I have only come across three in the .whole of my career,
and I could not do anything for them except send them to
an asylum. They are still there."
Some months later I penetrated into the strange world
of the "lunatic asylum" as it was then called, and I soon
realized that thousands and thousands of sick people were
living in those dreary institutions, cut off from the world,
very often abandoned by friends and relations, sometimes
undergoing weird treatments which were needlessly drastic
and painful since they were nearly always useless.
Nor are mental cases so scarce. In Western countries
more than one-third of all hospital beds are occupied by
them. If my former teacher had met so few during his
career, it was because they were then still considered not
as sick people but as "insane" creatures apart from the
normal everyday world, who must first of all be separated
from society before any question of treating them could

be considered. Only the psychiatrist, in close contact
with them in the asylum, could really get to know anything
about them, and then usually it was too late, and their
chances of cure were practically nil.
Yet when the relatives of such patients were questioned,
it often appeared that several doctors had been consulted
before the asylum was resorted to. They had been
treated for their liver, for glands, for sympathetic nervous
system disorders ; no one had noticed that mental trouble
was developing. Families, usually, refused to consider
any such possibility and When it became certain, they
hastened to conceal it. This, then, was why mental
disorders appeared to be so rare : for a long time they
were not recognized and, when they became evident
beyond any doubt, they were hushed up.
Because they are not recognized in time and because
they are concealed, it is often impossible to cure them ;
because it is impossible in these .circumstances to cure
them, they are said to be incurable and for this reason
they inspire fear. And precisely because they inspire fear
people are unwilling to recognize them and try to hide
them. This is the tragic vicious circle in which
psychiatry has been too long enclosed.
It is not difficult to understand the prejudice against
this branch of medicine, and even against the doctors
who specialized in it.
Not very long ago, the psychiatrist was still considered
as a curious individual who spent his time inventing
scientific names for the various types of madness, and
thinking up obscure theories which he could discuss only

with a select group of initiates. At present people are
still often inclined to consider him as a slighty sinister
person who sees signs of mental trouble everywhere, even
in quite ordinary, normal people.
Today, however, the psychiatrist has plenty of other
things ' to do. During the past 30 years numerous
accurate techniques have been developed and psychiatry
has become one of the most effective of the healing arts.
As recently as 1922 general paralysis was considered
incurable. A few years later, as a result of the general
use of malariotherapy (treatment by inducing of a high
fever) more than half of the cases were cured. Today,
thanks to early treatment of its cause (syphilis) this
terrible disease has practically disappeared.
Acute delirium of infectious or toxic origin which, when
it did not kill the patient, was often followed by serious
mental trouble, can today be cut short in a few hours.
Melancholia, which caused so many suicide deaths, and
even murders, can now be cured in a few days by shock
methods.
This, unfortunately, does not mean that everything is
known about mental disorders. Far from it : many of
them are still very mysterious indeed, and one of the most
frequent, schizophrenia, still raises innumerable unsolved
problems.
Early treatment is essential. Statistics show that the
great majority of mental cases are curable if properly
treated during the first weeks or months. After six months
the chances of cure are much less, and with the years
they become very small indeed. Either because of the
suspicion with which the psychiatrist is regarded, or for
other reasons, too often he is not called in to examine the
patient until the disease has had time to get a firm hold.
Even if the psychiatrist is called in at the first indica¬
tions of an acute phase, it is often difficult for him to
discover, by questions, what earlier signs there had been
that might have enabled him to detect the disease much
sooner. When the family is asked whether the trouble
started suddenly or gradually, the answers given are
usually contradictory : while insisting that there was
nothing to give any indication of mental trouble, they
will nevertheless admit that the patient "was not himself"
for some time or that he had been undergoing treatment
for "being run down" or "for a liver complaint," etc.
There are always warning signs in the months, or even
years, preceding the onset of mental disease, of something
wrong with the functioning of the higher nervous system,
but because these signs are often not of an alarming
nature, they are usually underestimated by the family and
attributed by the sufferer himself to quite other causes
such as overwork, digestive or heart trouble, etc.
Most of these early symptoms are, in fact, extremely
commonplace : they only become important and significant
when they appear in certain combinations and especially
if they occur at times when the person concerned has
suffered a bereavement, an accident or some similar
shock.
A slight fever, loss of weight, loss of appetite, or a slight
cough may be either without significance or the herald of
some serious organic trouble. In the same way a pain in
the head, inexplicable fatigue, change of character, sleep
and memory difficulties, or a lowering of work output,
require careful judgement on the part of the doctor in
deciding whether they indicate simply a passing indispo¬
sition, or whether they may be first warnings of mental
disease.
If preventive treatment is applied at this stage, there
is every chance of avoiding mental trouble. And if, in
spite of the preventive treatment, it does develop, the
immediate application of curative treatment will make
it less severe.
For treatment to be effective, it is just as important
that it should be given in satisfactory technical conditions
as that it be given early.
Mental patients lose some of their ability to adapt to
their environment. In most cases they must first of all
be placed in an atmosphere where they are artificially
freed from the demands of normal social life. This is the
primary reason for hospitalization and the hospital must,
therefore, provide this atmosphere.

A CHECK-UP
ON THE BRAIN
Mental diseases are the most curable and
the most hopeless of all illnesses, says Dr.
Paul Sivadon. The most curable because
if detected early, modern treatment will
in most cases effect a cure. In the U.S.A.,
for example, there has been a dramatic
drop in the total mental hospital popula¬
tion for three successive years (1956-58),
despite sharp increases in population. This
can be credited chiefly to three factors :
I) tranquillizing drugs. Though these do
not cure they make hitherto untreatable
patients more amenable to modern ther¬
apy. 2) the concept of the mental hospi¬
tal as a "therapeutic community". 3) the
"open door" and "open hospital" policies
which give patients freedom of movement.
Photos show "brain waves" being studied
on electro-encephalographs, one of many
methods of diagnosing mental diseases.

### 65236: The Most curable, the most hopeless of all diseases
MOST CURABLE;
MOST HOPELESS
(Continued)
HOSPITALIZATION TIME
REDUCED TO FOUR MONTHS
In other cases, particularly when the disorder has been
detected in time, there may be no need for hospitalization
and treatment can be effectively applied in an out¬
patient clinic.
The atmosphere of the psychiatric hospital must itself
be therapeutic that is to say, it must provide the arti¬
ficial social environment in which those adaptive faculties
which still remain to the patient will be exercised, while
the others which are disturbed are first allowed to rest and
then gradually re-educated.
Group activities should be organized in accordance
with the capacities of the majority, if not all, of the
patients. These activities, whether games, self-expression
in some sort of art craft, sports, courses and lectures,
should preferably be developed on the initiative of the
patients themselves so that they correspond as far as
possible to their needs.
Electric shocks & a long sleep
It is the task of the doctor to encourage patients to
resume their interest in the world around them and
to grow gradually away from their pathological atti¬
tudes and towards useful activities. This process can
often be helped on by tactful handling of opposition,
hostility, and even aggressiveness, on the part of the
patients.
Once the right atmosphere has been created, more pre¬
cise techniques can usefully be applied, including the
various shock treatments, such as :
Insulintherapy, invented by an Austrian physician,
Dr Sakel, in 1933. The method consists in injecting grad¬
ually increasing doses of insulin until the patient enters
a state of coma; the coma is then dissipated by the
administration of sugar. The treatment is repeated each
day for several weeks. The patient's personality, which is
temporarily disintegrated under the coma, tends to return
to normal on reawakening;
Electric shock treatment, introduced by two Italian
physicians, Doctors Cerletti and Bini, in 1937. The aim
is to provoke sudden loss of consciousness accompanied by
convulsions, by passing an electric current through the
brain for a fraction of a second. Here again it is a case
of momentary disintegration of the personality accom¬
panied by important humoral modifications. This is often
followed by recovery of mental balance, particularly in
cases of melancholia.
There are also various forms of narcotherapy. Some,
of short duration (often called "narco-analysis") consist
in intravenous injections of an anaesthetic for the pur¬
pose of removing the inhibitions or even of plunging him
into the realm of the subconscious so that he express
himself, relive certain experiences, and thus liberate him¬
self from painful anxieties and sometimes deeply rooted
complexes.
Another method used is to put the subject to sleep
by means of various narcotics for 16 to 20 hours a
day during 15-20 days, so that the overworked nervous
system may rest, and so that, probably through dreams,
the emotional balance may be restored. This is called
long-sleep treatment.
Recent drugs such as chlorpromazine and reserpine, and
many others which the chemists are discovering all the
time, appear to act in a similar way. They seem able to
relax those functional systems which are most commonly
involved in mental disease. Prolonged treatment, even
14
without resorting to artificial sleep, sometimes brings
about a veritable resurrection. In nearly all cases these
drugs relieve the most painful symptoms of mental
disorders such as agitation, anxiety, aggressiveness, etc.
Then, there is a whole range of surgical techniques
which are given the collective name of psychosurgery.
These consist in cutting those nerve fibres (leukotomy)
or areas of the cerebral cortex (topectomy) which appear
to be the anatomical seat of functional disorders. Such
techniques sometimes bring about spectacular cures but
they are unfortunately, for the present, often only
transitory.
Many other therapeutic methods are effective in certain
cases, but on the whole it can be seen that at present
there is no specific remedy for a specific disorder. The
various techniques are often complementary and must
be combined.
What results can we expect? These will vary according
to the gravity and duration of the symptoms. On the
whole, however, properly coordinated treatment in satis¬
factory technical conditions makes it possible to restore
70 to 80 per cent of mental patients so that they can
resume their place in society.
It often takes time sometimes months and years but
in some cases relatively short treatment will suffice.
Melancholia, for example, can often be cured in a few
weeks, and sometimes days.
The average hospitalization time for patients who are
cured is about four months.
If we remember that only a few years ago the propor¬
tion of cures was 30 per cent, and that on an average
these cures took one year, it will be seen that considerable
progress has been made. There is still much to be done,
but one thing is already quite certain: psychiatry works.
It should be emphasized again that as yet very little is
known of the inside mechanism of mental disease, but we
can already act on the little we do know.
Patient 'gets used' to his malady
In its early stages, mental sickness is no more than a
functional disorder which must be treated before it
has time to develop into a regular behaviour pattern.
If not treated, mental disease becomes a pathological way
of living: the patient "gets used to" his malady and his
life is built around it. Mental diseases are therefore at
once the most curable and the most hopeless of all
illnesses.
The amount of mental disease is increasing year by year
with the ever-growing pressure of rapid social change.
This is already a tremendous burden on the community
and an often unsuspected source of anxiety to individuals.
Nevertheless, as these diseases become more frequent,
science is forging new weapons against them and every
day it is becoming easier to prevent and cure them.
It is not possible today to ignore mental disease as did
my former professor ; we must indeed accept the fact
that it represents one of the burning medical and social
questions of our century.
On the other hand mental diseases need no longer be
dreaded as they were when people believed them incurable.
No one is immune to them, but they no longer carry the
threat of life-long banishment. In most cases the right
treatment, promptly applied and actively persevered with,
will soon set the patient on the road to recovery.

DIAL 5-5-5-5-5
Photos © Atlantic Press
In Amsterdam, Holland, people can dial 5-5-5-5-5 (five times five) at
any time of day or night and within minutes a fully qualified psychiatrist
is knocking at the door. This round-the-clock psychiatric first-aid
service was introduced some thirty years ago by Dr. Arie Querido,
Amsterdam's Director of Public Health. Dutch authorities are justi¬
fiably proud of the system, known in international medical circles as
"The Amsterdam Experiment." For the man in the street there is
reassurance in the knowledge that a qualified psychiatrist is waiting
on call, to come to his home and help him sort out his difficulties before
he reaches the breaking point, and before he needs treatment in a
mental hospital. "I have never believed," Dr. Querido says, "that
because a patient is mentally ill it follows that he has to remain in hos¬
pital. The determining factor is whether his condition makes it impos¬
sible for him to live in society." To keep a patient in hospital indefi¬
nitely is to give him what he unconsciously seeksa refuge from stresses.
The first-aid service takes this into account and the patient is examined
on his home ground, at school, in the factory or at home. This has
two advantages. First the patient is in familiar surroundings instead
of in the sometimes frightening atmosphere of a clinic. Secondly,
the psychiatrist can assess the extent to which the illness is aggra¬
vated by family or working difficulties. Two patients out of five never
have to go into hospital. Many remain at work and since they are self-
supporting cannot class themselves as "failures". Each Amsterdam
district now has its own psychiatrist and social workers (shown at
left visiting a man at his home). Yet the cost of this service is only
a fraction of what it would be if all these patients were in hospital.

### 65239: All of us have a 'breaking point': facing the strains and stresses of modern life
ALL OF
HAVE A 'BREAKING
POINT1
Facing the strains and
stresses of modern life
by Dr W.C. Mem
.
Few people, if any, in the modern world escape psycho¬
logical stress and strain of major proportions.
Everyone is aware of varying degrees of tension
within himself and if he is alert to the world about him,
he is certainly aware of the many tensions that surround
all of us. This stress and strain can seriously affect
mental well-being.
We know that under enough pressure, continued over a
long enough period of time, anyone can be overwhelmed,
and bend. All of us have a "breaking point."
Dr W. C. Menninger is President of the Menninger Foun¬
dation, a non-profit centre for research, training, treatment
and prevention in the psychiatric field. He was' in charge of
psychiatry in the American Army during the last war and
received the Distinguished Service Medal and the French Legion
of Honour. He has been President of the American Psychiatric
Association and other scientific bodies, and has written a
number of books on psychiatric subjects several of which are
intended for the general reader.
16
The tensions to which we are subjected certainly appear
to be increasing. This may explain the evident increase
in the incidence of mental ill-health and frank mental
illness. What can we do about this situation?
The physician in psychological medicine or psychiatry
does not have answers to political and social problems,
yet he knows that they seriously affect people's health.
This he discovers anew as he endeavours to understand
the illness of each new patient; as he studies the factors
that have led to breakdown under stress. On the basis
of what he learns he can advise a particular individual
how to remove, reduce or live with pressures to which he
is subject.
Becoming mentally ill is the response many people
make to problems too big for them to handle. Therefore,
the psychiatrist has the responsibility as well as the
opportunity to turn a microscope on the personality of
his patient. It is necessary for him to gain some
understanding of the forces which are creating, or have
created the tensions that have produced the illness.
There are two different types of such tensions.
## [Page 17](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/078166engo.pdf#page=17) 0
### 65239: All of us have a 'breaking point': facing the strains and stresses of modern life
First, there are those that originate within one's self
and are quite specific to each one of us. These internal
tensions are not shared with other people because they
are related to problems and conflicts of our own, conflicts
which often have arisen from experiences of childhood
and still continue, in varying degrees, to make us feel
uneasy under certain circumstances or with certain kinds
of people. These are always related to unconscious factors
in the personality and usually manifest themselves as
"anxiety."
Internal tensions show up in different ways in different
people. Some try to remain blind to them ; some project
the cause of them to someone else; some develop physical
symptoms. These and other psychological devices are
used by all of us in an effort to maintain our equilibrium.
Constructive action would be to discover sometimes
requiring professional help to do so how to modify
tension by understanding the situations or factors which
seem to precipitate it.
Resolving tensions
in one of 3 ways
In addition to internal tensions there are external ones.
These we do often share with others, at least to
some extent. Usually they are the result of our
environment ; experiences and events affecting our
family and friends as well as ourselves ; even affecting
our job, our communities, our country. Too often these
give rise to feelings of uncertainty, apprehension, or
outright fear.
We try to resolve the tensions thus created in one of
three ways : we can refuse to face their causes, which is
a kind of flight ; we too often fight back, thereby hurting
or destroying people or things, and in the process usually
hurting ourselves ; or we can compromise. Most of the
time we find ways to modify our attitudes and behaviour,
and also to modify the environment sufficiently to make a
constructive compromise with a net gain for the situation
as well as ourselves.
In planning treatment for a patient, the psychiatrist
must first figure out how to help the individual understand
himself and his problems better. Secondly, he must
consider the environment and its factors and how these
might be changed for the benefit of the patient.
Approaching from both directions as may be indicated,
his assignment is to help his patient face up to the stress
and strain that has produced his symptoms.
The individual who is filled with anxiety is rarely able
to look at himself objectively. It is difficult, if not
impossible, for him to see the causes of his own conflicts
or the various unreasonable or even irrational ways by
which he is trying to resolve them. A person can often,
if he will, gain some understanding about himself from
his familiy, or from friends or from reading. However, he
may need professional help.
Learning to handle
emotions of hostility
Very many problems, whether personal or universal,
revolve around the central theme of hate in its many
manifestations of selfishness, jealousy, prejudice,
dishonesty, yes, even mental illness and worst of all, war.
Hence, perhaps the most important thing for an individual
to do is to try to understand how he handles his own
hostility and to see What are the manifestations of that
energy drive in his behaviour and thinking.
It can be helpful, for instance, to see "running out on
responsibility" as a disguise of hostility towards one's
loved ones, towards one's boss, towards one's community.
Too often we are unaware of the thoughtlessness and
The Unesco Courier. May 1959
neglect, discrimination and selfishness that we display
frequently towards those whom we claim to love.
Uncontrolled emotion contributes to the production of
tension in ourselves and those around us. Therefore, it
behooves us to direct energy constructively. When angry,
instead of breaking a dish we can take a brisk walk; when-
frightened we can consider how best to meet the danger
instead of running away ; when we love we can either tie
our loved one to us, or preferably free him to choose
whether or not to stay.
Good insurance against getting overwhelmed by tension
is to develop ways of living with other people, and
activities either alone or shared, which give satisfaction
by being constructive and creative. Engaging in a sport,
creating a work of art, learning a craft, playing a game, '
singing a song, reading a book, helping someone else
working to Improve the community these and many
other activities can contribute to one's sense of well-being,
let one recoup from strain.
For many people a philosophy of life and a firm
religious faith provide extra strength to resist the wear
of tension and stress. They also can be the source of
motivation towards goals to which they aspire.
Loyal friends and associates can be a bulwark against
that "alone" feeling which comes when difficulties seem
about to overwhelm one. But we must take the initiative
to call upon those who would gladly help if they are
allowed to know we need them. And, of course, it is
important that this relationship be a two-way one and
that we be willing to go to the aid of our loved ones and
co-workers when they need us.
A bulwark against
that 'alone' feeling
T
o modify the environment, just as to modify our
own selves, takes action; it means doing specific
things:
Examine and evaluate and talk about the possible
causes of tensions. In essence, this is what the
psychiatrist tries to encourage his patient to do in order
that both may understand just what problems are at"the
root of anxiety and fear. It has often been said that a
clear understanding of a problem is 90 per cent, of its
solution. This is a proven fact in resolving conflicts
within the individual personality, and this can apply also
in a family. Conceivably it can apply equally in larger
units such as a company, a neighbourhood, a city, state or
nation ;
Assume full responsibility as a person, as a member
of a family; as a worker on the job, as a participating
citizen. This means acquiring basic education, training
and experience ; continually working for better solutions
of the problems of the groups in which we find ourselves ;
Thoughtfully plan for the future. This has economic,
social, educational and vocational aspects. Important in
this is to find the job best suited to one's abilities and
opportunities ; then relieve its routine and responsibility
with an avocation or a hobby. Often recreation, can serve
for re-creation.
Any plan for protection against and handling of stress
and strain requires action. One can find a cause or a
mission and take it seriously. What the world needs most
is people who will give of themselves to the needs of the
family, the community, the state, the nation and the
world. What a person needs most is to be wanted and
necessary.
There are so many opportunities in every country and
in every culture to help our fellow men by improving
education, social ' welfare, health ; by strengthening
religious faith. To do this implies that adults must grow
up emotionally to the point that they find more satisfac¬
tion in giving than in receiving.

RETURN HOME FROM INSANITY
Home is now more than just the drudgery of diapers and dishes to
this American woman who came back to a normal life after six
months in a mental hospital. The ostensible reasons for her
breakdown seemed clear in her shattered mind: bills to pay, a
husband who couldn't seem to make ends meet, four children
they couldn't afford. So she left home on a midnight bus... and
then something snapped. She got off the bus, tried to drive away
in a car parked nearby and ended up in a mental hospital after
the police had arrested her. In the hospital, psychiatrists slowly
managed to piece together the jumbled jigsaw puzzle of her life.
Group therapy helped and so did the easy, confidence-breeding
atmosphere in the psychiatrist's office. The web of her life was
spun out: a frightful childhood with parents who had divorced
when she was only six, a father who locked her in a cupboard
for hours whenever she didn't obey him, then a meeting with her
future husband, the teacher at a night school she was attending
as a 17-year-old girl. He was older, he inspired confidence, but
the illusions didn't last long. First came the babies, then came
the tense tight-rope walk of balancing a budget. Now she under¬
stood why she had taken that midnight bus. She was able to face
life again. She went home to her husband and children on a
weekend visit. And then after only six months of treatment in
a modern psychiatric hospital, she was able to go home for good.

### 65242: Mental health: facts and figures
Facts and Figures
Test your mental health
To aid you in taking your own mental
health pulse, try this list of questions
drawn up by Dr William C. Menninger,
President of the Menninger Foundation,
Topeka, Kansas:
Are you always worrying?
Are you unable to concentrate because
of unrecognized reasons?
Are you continually unhappy without
justified cause?
Do you lose your temper easily and
often?
Are you troubled by regular insomnia?
Do you have wide fluctuations in your
moods, from depression to elation, back
to depression, which incapacitate you?
Do you continually dislike to be with
people?
Are you upset if the routine of your life
is disturbed?
Do your children consistently "get on
your nerves"?
Are you "browned off" and constantly
bitter?
Are you afraid without real cause?
Are you always right and the other
person always wrong?
Do you have numerous aches and pains
for which no doctor can find a physical
cause?
The conditions charted in these questions
are the major warning signals of poor
mental health in one degree or another.
According to Dr Menninger, help is
necessary if your answer to any of these
questions is definitely "yes".
How many mentally ill ?
The total amount of mental disorder in
the world cannot at present be estimated
because of the lack of reliable statistics.
The following facts may however be
assumed to give a fairly good indication
of the situation in countries at different
stages of economic and social development:
Insanity rates
In the more culturally and economic¬
ally developed countries, it is recognized
that there is an insanity rate of about
1 per cent, amongst the people of these
countries, and a rate of neurosis defined
at the level of partially disabling illness
of approximately 10 per cent.
Two per thousand
India: "About 2 per thousand of our
population is likely to be afflicted with a
mental disorder which sooner or later
requires hospitalization. We have also to
take into account the mental defectives
who average at least 8 to 10 per thousand
of our population, and epileptics who
perhaps number 0.5 per cent, of the
population. Further we must include in
this category various types of physical
illnesses like high blood pressure, skin
disorders of various types, cardiovascular
conditions and others in which chronic
emotional stresses do contribute a major
20
share. Added to this formidable list we
have problems of social pathology. In our
country, about 1,750,000 crimes are
committed every year; between 15,000 and
17,000 people commit suicide in a year;
and, at the lowest estimate, about 15 to
20 per cent, of our teenagers are juvenile
delinquents."
One in Sixteen
United States of America: It is estimated
that there are about 9 million people in
the United States of America suffering
from mental illness (1.5 million) and other
personality disturbances (7.5 million) all
in all, about 1 in every 16 people. In
addition, there are about 1.5 million
mentally deficient people conservatively
about 1 per cent, of the population.
One out of every 12 children born in
the United States of America each year
will sometime during his life suffer a mental
illness severe enough to require hospital¬
ization. The number who will develop
less severe mental illness is much greater.
The patients in mental hospitals make
up on any day almost half of all the
patients in all the hospitals in the United
States of America. Taken together, the
patients in mental hospitals and in insti¬
tutions for the mentally deficient and
epileptic make up about 55 per cent, of
all the patients in all hospitals.
In addition to the people who go to
mental hospitals, clinics or private psy¬
chiatrist for treatment of mental illness or
other personality disturbances, it is estim¬
ated that about 30 per cent, of all the
patients who go to general hospitals, and
about 50 per cent, of all the patients
who go to general practitioners are suffering
from mental illness and other personality
disturbances or physical illness associated
with mental illness.
One in ten
Among French . children: It is estim¬
ated that in France 4.3 per cent, of all
children between 4 and 17 years old have
some degree of mental deficiency and need
special schooling and attention; but the
proportion of children or adolescents who
will need some psychological care and
guidance at one time during their school
or post-school years is at least 5 to 10 per
cent.
In the armed forces: Other evidence of
the extent of mental illness in the United
States of America comes from the armed
forces. During World War II, about
900,000 men between the ages of 18 and
37, or about 5 per cent, of the 18 million
examined, were rejected for military service
because of mental disorder.
The cost of mental disease
In terms of money, the cost of mental
disease is fantastic. Maintenance and
treatment in mental hospitals in the
United States of America require about
$750,000,000 a year. The strain on the
individual taxpayer is illustrated by the fact
that 28 per cent, of every tax dollar in
the operating budget of New York State
goes for the care of the mentally ill. If
the cost of veterans' compensation is
included, the total amounts to about
$3,000,000 a day for the country as a
whole. The loss to society is completely
immeasurable.
The roots of mental health
Among the most significant developments
in psychiatry during the past quarter of a
century has been the steady growth of
evidence that the quality of the parental
care which a child receives in his earliest
years is of vital importance for his future
mental health.
The infant and young child should expe¬
rience a warm, intimate and continuous
relationship with his mother (or permanent
mother-substitute) in which both find satis¬
faction and enjoyment. It is this rela¬
tionship with the mother, varied in
countless ways by relations with the
father and siblings, that child psychiatrists
and many others believe underlies the
development of character and mental health.
It follows that broken homes are likely
to produce behaviour disorders in children,
and this has been confirmed by several
studies.
Child assault victims
In Israel, no child under fourteen who
has been the victim of sexual assault may
appear in court. Instead, the child's
testimony is taken by a social worker who
then gives the child's evidence. The
purpose of this law, passed several years
ago, is to protect children from the ordeal
of testifying and undergoing cross-
examination which often harms them as
much as the actual crime itself. As a
result, many of the after-effects of such
assaults have been alleviated.
Broken homes, twisted lives
In the United Kingdom, for example, of
418 delinquent children no less than 45 per
cent, came from broken homes. Of the
remainder nearly one half (about 25 per
cent, of the whole) came from homes
where, although the parents were living
together, conditions were very bad, includ¬
ing cruelty, immorality, mental instability,
neglect, harsh treatment and rejection.
Only 30 per cent, came from homes which
were complete and reasonably happy.
In Paris, 839 children suffering from
behaviour disorders were compared with
nearly 70,000 "normal" children. Of the
problem children 66 per cent, came from
broken homes while only 12 per cent, of
the "normal" children did so.
Lonely old people
The rise in the admission rate of old
people to mental hospitals in many coun¬
tries is much steeper than could be ex¬
pected from the increase in the number of
old people.
Many surveys have referred to the fre¬
quency among the aged of loneliness,

apathy, dejection and melancholy, often
associated with bereavement, isolation, and
growing physical infirmity. One study
found that states of depression and anxiety
are present in 50 per cent, of the aged
surveyed, and many of the cases of grave
mental illness may be drawn from this large
pool of lonely and unhappy people. Yet
hardly anywhere have they, so far, received
any specific attention as psychiatric cases
from the health and welfare services con¬
cerned with the aged in the community.
Suicide and mental health
People who commit suicide suffer from
mental or physical illness or a combination
of the two. The highest death-rates from
suicide in both sexes are found in lapan,
Denmark, Austria and Switzerland. The
lowest rates are reported in Ireland, North¬
ern Ireland, Chile, Scotland and Spain.
Almost everywhere in the world men are
much more prone to suicide than women.
The ratio is in general 3 to 1, but it
varies from more than 4 to 1 in Norway
to less than 2 to 1 in Japan.
Highest rates for male suicide are re¬
corded in Switzerland, Denmark, Austria
and Finland. For women, they are to be
found in Japan, Denmark and Austria.
Mentally abnormal criminals
Crime will yield only to an attack on
many fronts including an attack on poor
mental health in the community. Various
studies of criminal populations have shown
that a third to three quarters, depending
on the seriousness of the offence, suffer
from some degree of mental abnormality.
Irrational fears and hopes
In the minds of people everywhere,
atomic energy remains a threatening and
mysterious force, interpreted very often in
magical rather than rational terms, and
fraught with irrational fears and irrational
hopes, the fears being expressed far more
often than the hopes. The anxiety-pro¬
ducing character of atomic energy may be
ascribed to the peculiar nature of radiations
unseen, unheard, unfelt and, as far as the
individual is concerned, uncontrollable.
The most terrifying aspect is perhaps that
of a tremendous power that may get out
of control.
Evidence about people's emotional reac¬
tions to atomic matters is found in their
day-to-day conversations. Disagreeable
weather, the failure of the harvest and
other natural phenomena are frequently
blamed on atom bomb tests. Fears of
the fall-out, of the disposal of atomic waste,
of the pollution of water, milk and food
supplies, or of harmful genetic effects are
direct expressions of anxiety. With the
advent of the atomic age humanity is thus
facing added mental-health problems.
The doctor's daily rounds
Medical students should be trained for
their role as "pillars of mental health".
According to a study carried out in France,
at least 50 per cent, of the medical work
of the general practitioner is directly con¬
cerned with mental health, yet the general
practitioner is less conscious of his key role
in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment
of mental ills than with respect to diseases
like tuberculosis or venereal disease. There
are innumerable opportunities for mental-
health work in the physician's daily round,
in work with out-patients, in school medical
services, in prenatal and premarital con¬
sultations, in industrial hygiene, and wher¬
ever the doctor is in contact with social
workers, nurses, employers etc.
Modern man's mental health
"Psychotropic agents! The "tranquilli¬
zer" in one pocket; the "pep" pill in the
other. Drugs to dispel nightmares; drugs
to invoke dreams; drugs to escape from
reality into fantasy or from fantasy into
reality. Even Alice-in-Wonderland drugs
by means of which adults can shrink back
into childhood."
That is the caricature of one type of
modern man, harassed by headlines; tortur¬
ed by the ticker-tape; tormented by the
telephone; as "manic-depressive" as his
sales-charts; wakeful when he should be
asleep and drowsy when he should be
awake; worrying about his blood pressure
and nursing his duodenal ulcer; driving
himself like a highspeed car through dense
traffic, braking or accelerating in turn,
running away from himself and taking
himself with him. He has 2,500 million
neighbours in the wider world; he is alone
in that private world himself.
There are still other types those whose
tensions become intolerable through being
chained to piece-work machines, white-
collar workers dogged by economic worries
and "wife trouble", hungry and miserable
peasants driven to take hashish for solace.
Attitude to mental disease
What is your attitude toward a mental
patient, or a former mental patient? Do
you know that his recovery and return to
normal life depends largely on what people
think and feel about him? Open-door
hospitals, out-patient care, domiciliary
services for mental patients, which are the
methods of social psychiatry today, can
be successful only if community attitudes
toward mental disorders do not present an
obstacle to mental-health work.
Fear and a sense of estrangement of the
mentally disordered are often found in-
countries where there, are vast mental hos¬
pitals, originally erected for the incarcera¬
tion, rather than the treatment and reha¬
bilitation of patients. In countries just
starting to organize mental-health care,
these attitudes do not appear as common.
Possessed by devils
Among primitive peoples, mental disease
has generally been looked upon either as a
punishment by a good spirit, or, more often,
as the result of malevolent action by the
devil, or even as demoniacal possession.
This conception, which still survives among
certain African and East Indian peoples,
was very prevalent throughout the Middle
Ages and even later.
During the Middle Ages a few monaste¬
ries harboured lunatics, but it appears that
the first asylums for their care were built
by the Moslems, whose ideas on the treat¬
ment of mental patients were derived from
the Eastern physicians. In Europe, the
Bethlem hospital in London was first used
as an asylum in 1403; the second was
opened in 1408 at Valencia in Spain.
During the following century further asy¬
lums were established in Europe. The
insane were received into the first general
hospital established in North America in
Pennsylvania in 1756 (but were first
detained in the cellars!). The first Ameri¬
can hospital for the insane was opened in
Virginia in 1773.
Asylums like prisons
The purpose of these early asylums was
not the care and treatment of the mentally
ill, but the incarceration and, if possible,
subjugation of the violently insane. Most
of these asylums resembled prisons, and the
inmates were regarded as criminals. Very
gradually a more humane attitude towards
the mentally affected began to develop. In
1792 more than 50 insane inmates of the
Bicetre hospital in Paris were liberated
from their chains, which had been worn
for over 30 years. Even pessimists had
to agree that these patients became less
rather than more violent. In Italy, Via-
cenzo Chiarugi struck off chains from the
insane at about the same time.
Reform in England was initiated by the
Quakers who founded the York Retreat in
1813, purposely avoiding the name "asylum"
or "madhouse". The use of chains was
abolished, and therapy was introduced,
consisting in work and exercise and the
cultivation of a moral atmosphere. The
fame of the English Quaker reforms spread
to America, and in 1817 the Friends Asy¬
lum was opened in Pennsylvania, where
the mentally ill were treated as human
beings instead of beasts.
More cures in mental hospitals
Ten years ago in Ville-Evrard, France,
the average stay of patients before dis¬
charge was over one year; now it is four
months. This hospital, which in 1948 had
550 beds and admitted 100 new patients
a year, now has only 270 beds but gives
care to 600 new patients a year, and the
percentage of patients that must be kept
indefinitely has gone down from 50 per
cent, to 7 per cent.
In New York State, despite a 10 per
cent, rise in admissions to mental hospitals
during the past three years, there has been
an increase of 23 per cent, in releases.
As a result, the mental hospital population
has decreased first by 450 patients in
1955-1956 and in 1956-1957 and by 1,200
patients in 1957-1958.
Don't keep up with the
Joneses !
In America social climbing is a national
exercise, and many athletes in this kind of
competition for respect pay heavily in
mental health. In a society like ours, in
which money income is distributed in
shares of graduated size, the demand for
respect takes many forms; striving to obtain
all the respect that a new wealth position
makes possible; seeking to save enough
respect to compensate for economic limita¬
tion; trying to discover means of scoring
prestige points in order to get ahead of
competitors having about the same income
. . . Those who keep up with the Joneses
must often go all the way to the mental
hospital.
Mental health and world
peace
"The psychiatrist knows that individuals
who have emotional disabilities of their
own guilt, fears, inferiorities are certain
to project their hates on others, on groups,
communities, or nations, and thus jeopar¬
dize seriously the external relations of
those who are associated with them, in the
view of their "enemy". They are the
people who must believe the worst of all
foreigners and who then react emotionally
and irrationally to these beliefs 	 "

### 65243: One student in ten needs a psychiatrist
The mental health of college and university students
has attracted growing attention in the past three or
four decades. This has come about in part because
of growing awareness that many students fail to complete
their academic studies even though they have superior
intellectual capacities. In some institutions the frequency
of student suicides has caused much concern. Progress
in meeting the needs of students with emotional disturb¬
ances has been very uneven in the different parts of the
world.
In an attempt to bring together the current ideas on
this subject from a wide variety of sources, the World
Federation for Mental Health and the International
Association of Universities sponsored an international
conference on student mental health in Princeton, New
Jersey, in September 1956. This was the first of its kind
ever held.
Dana L. Farnsworth and Henry K. Oliver are both of Harvard
University, where Professor Farnsworth is Director of the Uni¬
versity Health Seroices. This article is condensed from the
current issue of Unesco's quarterly International Social Science
Journal, Volume XI, n° 1, 1959, devoted to Social Aspects of
Mental Health; pnce $2.00 ; 10/-stg ; 600 FF.

Opinions were expressed by all delegates that mental
health problems were the most serious faced by students
in their respective countries. However, in two of them
(France and the Netherlands) tuberculosis had only
recently ceased to occupy first place. Conflicts affecting
students were usually expressed in terms of environ¬
mental factors such as fear of examinations, poor housing
conditions, or unsatisfactory relations with faculty
members in some countries, such as Australia and France;
while in the United States, internal or intrapsychic
conflicts were most often regarded as the primary cause
of disturbance. Students in Mexico and some of the Far
Eastern countries exerted more influence on the faculty
and administration than in other countries, often through
strikes and riots. Suicide was a problem everywhere.
Universities in the Netherlands and in France do not
use screening procedures for admission; hence large
numbers of students unable to keep up with the standards
of the institution are dropped as failures. The use of
stimulants before and during examinations was reported
as common in most countries. The Philippines have many
more graduates of universities than opportunities for
them to use their, professional skills, thus causing much

frustration. Courses in mental health were quite
successful in Costa Rica, but were used less frequently
elsewhere.
Mental health problems of students differ in various
countries, depending upon how many people go to college.
College attendance ranges from extremes of one in 60 of
the population in the United States to one in 640 in
England. This has quite naturally resulted in contrast¬
ing attitudes toward college in these two countries. In
England college attendance is considered a privilege; in
the United States it is considered a right.
In the United States, the country in which the mental
health of college and university students has thus far
received the most attention, mental health programmes
have been organized in about a hundred colleges. Most
of these have a part-time psychiatrist in charge some¬
times assisted by a clinical psychologist, or more rarely
a social worker. In a few universities full-time
psychiatrists are on the staff; the total number of such
individuals does not exceed 40 at the present time.
At the first meeting of the American Student (now
College) Health Association in 1920, Franfcwood Williams
urged that colleges develop mental health programmes
for the following reasons:
1. To conserve the student body, so that intellectually
capable students may not be forced unnecessarily to give
up a college career.
2. To forestall failure in the form of nervous and men¬
tal disease, immediate or remote.
3. To minimize partial failure through mediocrity,
inadequacy, inefficiency, and unhappiness.
4. To make it possible for each individual to use more
fully the intellectual capacity he possesses, through
widening the sphere of conscious control and thereby
widening the sphere of social control.
Shortage of psychiatric services
Practically all psychiatrists who have had extensive
experience in working with students agree that about
10 per cent of the members of any institution of
higher learning are likely to have emotional problems at
some time or other during each year which interfere
seriously with their work. Very few institutions have
sufficiently well-developed psychiatric services to deal
with that number of students. In fact, the upper limit
of psychiatric consultations and therapeutic interviews
in colleges and universities at the present time is
determined, not by need, but by the number of hours of
psychiatric time available. Thus the lack of financial and
professional resources has so far prevented any definitive
demonstration of the full extent of emotional illness in
any student body.
Unofficial surveys in some schools have indicated that
the amount of emotional illness, and the extent of psycho¬
therapy for it, has been far greater than we had previously
been led to believe. It seems quite likely that not only
college students, but many students in graduate schools,
have serious and unresolved emotional problems that
greatly impede their professional development.
It has been found that in almost all instances of emo¬
tional disturbance in students the ultimate causes spring
from conditions in the families, communities, and social
environments from which students come. Sometimes a
contrast between the values and customs in a college
and those in the community from which a student comes
contributes to illness. It is rare that conditions in
a particular college are solely responsible for serious
mental illness.
Among the unfavourable conditions frequently encoun¬
tered in students who have emotional conflict are parental
discord, emotional rigidity, intolerance and prejudice In
parents and older associates, lack of emotional warmth
in parents and teachers, absent or inconsistent discipline,
and other negative psychological or environmental
influences.
Those students who come to psychiatrists or other
counsellors for help may do so because of apparent
scholastic failure, apathy, depression, excessive anxiety,
compulsive behaviour, obsessive thinking, physical symp¬
toms (psychosomatic disorders), and various types of
behaviour which are unacceptable to associates or to the
community. Severe psychoses occur in most institutions
at an average rate of about two for every thousand
students enrolled per year. Institutions which have
more than an average of one suicide for every 10,000
student-years might well look to unfavourable conditions
within the university or to the lack of effectiveness of
their treatment facilities.
Causes of academic failure
Several trends suggesting future progress seem to be
discernible today. College presidents, deans and edu¬
cators are taking a greater interest in making
available to faculty members ¡knowledge and Insight
concerning those emotional factors that accelerate or
impede learning. There is increasing dissatisfaction with
reliance only on types of counselling that are confined
largely to course information, career choice, and testing
for aptitudes or intellectual capacity, even though these
activities are valuable and necessary. The need for apply¬
ing the ¡knowledge gained from the newer studies in
personality growth and development, as well as a
consideration of the factors which cause students to
become ill and ineffective academically, is becoming
apparent to many educators. But how to apply this know¬
ledge still remains an unsolved problem.
The development of training programmes for young
psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, and social workers
who wish to enter the field are urgently required. Train¬
ing programmes in advanced centres would probably not
be very helpful to persons from countries where there are
very few psychiatrists. A more promising idea is to
develop programmes in the countries where they are
vitally needed, utilizing professional skills that are
available there, and possibly having occasional consul¬
tations from psychiatrists or psychologists from the larger
centres. A person trained according to a large programme
with comparatively adequate facilities would probably
find it very difficult to adapt what he has learned during
his training to conditions in his own country which
might be quite different.
No undermining of authority
Delegates to- the International Conference on Student
Mental Health all agreed that mental health is not
characterized by adjustment under all circum¬
stances, nor by freedom from anxiety and tension, nor
by freedom from dissatisfaction, nor by conformity or
constant happiness. Furthermore the possession of
mental health does not imply the absence of personal
idiosyncrasies, a lessening of accomplishment or creativ-
eness, or the undermining of authority, and it is in no
way opposed to religious values.
Among the recommendations or resolutions of the confe¬
rence were the following: ^3

(Continued)
KEY PROBLEM ON THE CAMPOS
a) The promotion of mental health In universities is
the concern of every person connected with the institution.
It should be seen as part of the general problem of a
student's health and part of the picture of the student's
welfare. It is not enough to provide counselling and
psychiatric services; attempts should also be made to
develop to the maximum extent those factors within a
university which allow each student to reach his greatest
potential growth, both academically and as a human
being.
b) A mental health programme should be geared to
the normal educative processes of the institution.
Programmes in different institutions in various parts of
the world, and within particular countries, should take
a variety of forms appropriate to the local situation.
Experiments are desirable, even in institutions with very
limited resources.
c) Colleges and universities should provide opportun¬
ities, either by teaching courses or other means, for
students to obtain instruction in marriage and family
life. This instruction should be considered in the context
of general mental health. It is particularly important
in schools of medicine, theology and education, graduates
of which are expected to guide not only their own
families' lives but those of others as well.
' d) Educational administrators, faculty members and
students should have some awareness of the kinds of
alteration in behaviour and thought in any given society
or culture which indicate serious emotional disturbance
requiring professional attention.
e) Students should be given as much responsibility as
possible, within limits, for their own education and moral
development. The views of students on university policy
and curriculum planning should be known and taken
into consideration by faculty and administration. With¬
out good relations between students and staff misunder¬
standings are bound to arise.
/) Special attention should be given to the lonely
student; although the student who prefers solitude is not
necessarily a proper object of concern. Orientation
programmes at the beginning of a college course may
be helpful and should be widespread.
g) Since marriage during college is becoming increas¬
ingly common, the needs of married students and their
dependents call for special attention and study.
7i) Proper housing and other environmental conditions
of students are appropriate subjects for consideration by
college and university planners.
¿) Conference delegates deplored the development of
curricula so crowded by formal studies, particularly in
pre-professional courses and in professional schools, that
insufficient time is left for leisure, recreation, and
participation in activities that contribute to a well-
rounded educational experience.
j) It is an important principle of mental health that
all human beings, regardless of sex, race, colour or
religion, should be treated with equal dignity. Total
oUscrimination on the basis of race, colour or religion
injures both those rejected from and those accepted In¬
to the institutions that practise such policies.
k) Severe overcrowding of college or university premises
produces serious psychological problems in many students.
This is a very delicate problem, but a rapidly growing
one in nearly all countries.
From all these considerations, it is clear that efforts
designed to promote mental health in colleges and
universities have been relatively slight. It is equally
clear that the need is very great. If the mental health
of college students everywhere can be improved, however
slightly, the students in turn may be expected later to lead
more effectively in mental health promotion in their own
communities, thus spreading human friendship.
DAZED YOUTH ADRIFT
IN A STORMY WORLD
It cannot be denied that youth is severely tried by the
impact of all the noise and violent music, aggressive adver¬
tising, screen thrillers, unhealthy literature, sensational,
alarmist news, to which it is subjected.
What is the effect of these constant impacts ? Obviously,
much overfatigue, a state of daze and considerably reduced
resistance and stamina; but there is also marked nervous ten¬
sion, increased aggressiveness and a love of violence even, at
times, contempt for life. Those who are continually being hit
want to hit back; those whose life is constantly subject to
attack treat life as valueless.
The world today is shaken and stormy; young people can
find no safe anchorage in it and this at the very time when,
only too often, the family is no longer playing its full part.
it is not surprising that the number of maladjusted young people
is constantly increasing. Society has not only to cope with the
havoc wrought by juvenile delinquency, but has further cause
for concern in the growing signs of social maladjustment among
normal young people. Serious problems are arising in the
schools ; special classes and special institutions have to be pro¬
vided. A new profession has come into being that of the
teacher of maladjusted children. It is a difficult calling, and
one that requires all the fine self-abnegation of young men and
women.

HIGHEST NEUROSIS
FOUND IN TEACHERS
Nervous disorders are far more common among people
engaged in intellectual work, particularly teachers, than
among manual workers. This was made clear in dis¬
cussions at a symposium on the mental health of intellectual
workers, organized recently at the International Centre of
Pedagogical Studies in Sèvres, near Paris.
Dr Paul Sivadon, chief medical officer of psychiatric hospi¬
tals in the Paris area, stated that in France mental troubles
are definitely, on the increase among educators, particularly
among secondary school teachers. A year-long study carried
out at the Mayo Clinic (U.S.A.) revealed that of every 100
teachers treated for various functional ailments, 54% were
admitted for neurotic disorders. In other professions the
percentage of neurosis for every 100 admissions was: clergy¬
men and nuns, 42 per cent; lawyers and housewives, 36 per
cent; dentists, 30 per cent; farmers, 19 per cent; doctors, 17
per cent and railway mechanics 9 per cent.
According to Professor Delore, director of the Institute of
Social Medicine at Lyons University, most intellectuals do not
observe basic health rules. Not only are they generally of a
nervous temperament but their sedentary occupations make
them prone to digestive and circulatory troubles.
SUICIDES AT COLLEGE. A survey made at Yale University in the United States showed that while accidentsparticularly auto¬
mobile smashesare the leading cause of death among students, the second most common is suicide. Between 1920 and 1955
out of 209 deaths of enrolled Yale students, 92 were caused by accidents and 25 were due to suicide. Other studies have shown
that suicide accounts for 8 to 12 per cent of all deaths of American college men and women. Mental health problems of students
are now being studied more closely and among the many aspects of planning to which college and university authorities are giving
increasing attention is the question of proper housing. Overcrowding is known to produce serious psychological problems in
many students. Shown here is striking new seven-storey dormitory with arabesque grille facade at the University of Carolina, U.S.A.

### 65244: Art and the troubled mind
ART AND THE TROUBLED
by Enrico Fulchignoni
Since the dawn of civilization, man has looked upon
the arts not only as a decorative element in life but
also as a consolation for his afflictions. It is no
accident that Apollo, who reigned over the flowering of
the arts, was also considered the god of healing, equi-
. librium and serene harmony.
The relation between artistic creation and the working
of the mind has also been the subject of considerable
discussion for many years. At the end of the 19th century
the theories of Cesare Lombroso and Max Nordau, who
strove to establish a relation between genius and dege¬
neracy, were very much in vogue. This negative approach
was to retard research into the inner significance of Works
of art for many years, and more important, was to prevent
all study of the possible "therapeutic" effects of artistic
creation until relatively recently.
Today the therapeutic effects of artistic creation are
accepted by contemporary science as a result of the pro¬
gress made in psychology and psychiatry^ Psychologists
now see mental illness as a "cause of worry" which can
ultimately lead to mental self-improvement.
The man who feels that he is "different from other peo-
Enrico Fulchignoni is professor of psychology at the Univer¬
sity of Rome. He is one of Europe's specialists on the problems
of psycho-pathological art. His film "Images de la Folie",
devoted to this subject, was awarded the Bichat Prize for Medical
Films in 1955. Professor Fulchignoni is a member of Unesco's
staff.
pie" is forced by his very unbalance to revise accepted
standards and values in' order to adapt them for his own
use. This gives rise to a kind of protest of which the work
of art is an expression in more or less symbolic form.
According to certain schools of psychiatry, the effect of
this observation is two-fold. On the one hand, it enables
a specialist to study elements in a work of art presented
to him for psychological diagnosis and to indicate certain
deep-seated impulses behind the work of art. On the
other hand, in the field of therapy, it is now possible for
a patient to ease his psychological tension and conflicts
through artistic creation.
Other problems more or less related to the discovery of
the psycho-pathological significance of works of art have
gradually been raised. For example, what value can be
attached to spontaneous drawings or to paintings of sub¬
jects produced on command whioh preceded mental illness
when compared to those executed during the illness?
What difference is there between drawings which seem to
stem directly from mental disorders and those apparently
unrelated to them? And what yardstick is one to use for
works produced by mental patients who have never had
previous artistic training?
Questions such as these and many others were first
investigated chiefly in France and in the United States.
As the result of conclusive experiments made in these
countries art studios have multiplied in mental hospitals
in Brazil, Canada, Italy, Great Britain, Germany and other
countries in various parts of the world.
SCHIZOPHRENIC FLOWERS. A volume of Victorian
flower paintings was discovered recently in an antique shop
by a doctor in England. The paintings show that the painter,
who is unknown, apparently suffered from an acute schizo¬
phrenic episode lasting six months to a year and made a
good recovery. In May 1864 there is a sudden marked change

### 65244: Art and the troubled mind
It was at the start of the century that Zieher and
Bertschinger made their first observations of psychotic
adults using the principles outlined above. Rorschach, the
great Swiss psychologist and father of the "ink-blot tests",
was among the first to show in 1913 how drawings by
schizophrenics could be used to make accurate diagnoses.
He was also one of the first to analyse apparently mean¬
ingless doodling for symbolic elements. A most important
discovery was placed at the disposal of medical men: that
an evolution could be observed in the drawings of mental
patients both in the normal development of the illness
and as treatment progressed, irrespective of whether the
treatment Was psycho-surgical (lobotomy), biological
(shock treatment, tranquillizing drugs, etc.) or psycholo¬
gical.
More recently another step was made when these same
principles were applied in treating children suffering from
mental and emotional disturbances. It was the English
school of psychiatry which in 1928 or thereabouts was the
first to discover the therapeutic effects of drawing, paint¬
ing or modelling on young patients. This was an impor¬
tant discovery since in certain cases drawings can replace
all other means of communication between the physician
and the child. This opened up a new avenue of contact
which had previously been ignored.
Very often a child can give free vent to his aggressive
instincts and to his emotional life through games, draw¬
ing or modelling. The use of techniques applied either
individually or in group form, has resulted in experiments
whereby children can freely express their impulses, their
anxieties and their feeling of insecurity. To the physician
this is very important because young patients are often
unable to explain their mental difficulties in words.
Artistic creation has therefore become an increasingly
valuable tool for diagnosis and therapy not only in cases
of mental disorders but also in the rehabilitation of delin¬
quent or maladjusted children.
In adults the process of artistic creation obviously is
The Unesco Courier. May 1959
much more complex and cannot be explained merely as
the liberation of instinctive impulses. Someone once said
that art is a winding path which the fantasy of the mind
takes to reach the road to reality. Psychologists consider
artistic creation as a path leading from the inner man to
the outside world, and they term this extroversion. By
its very nature it is a means of communication between
one person and another. Art in fact claims to be and is
a language. It is one of the most powerful ways of bring¬
ing an inner conflict out into the open and generalizing it.
Art, in doing this, can help the mentally-ill adult by
acting as mental catalyser.
Here, we perhaps have one explanation of the feeling
of fulfillment which has been described as one of the
characteristics of esthetic enjoyment. "Of course," writes
Prof. Volmat, a French specialist in- the field, "only few
of our patients who by and large are mediocre artists and
whose artistic expression is often rudimentary, ever attain
this fulfillment and harmony which require a complete
readjustment of their disturbed personalities. But by
turning to art, they take a first step toward mental equi¬
librium."
Thus art has enabled a large number of mentally ill
persons to regain their notions of being human beings
despite the disorder which has struck and paralyzed them.
There are cases where art therapy, like all therapy, is
advisable and when it is not. It has its successes and its
failures. It can and should be combined with other tech¬
niques of occupational therapy. It can be applied simul¬
taneously with shock treatment or psycho-surgery.
All schools of psychiatry which have been studying this
problem since the beginning of the century recognize in
this technique a new instrument of therapy which has
resulted in undeniable progress in curing mental illness.
Thus in certain cases, the language of colour and the
physical act of handling materials help the mentally sick

them to find their way back to normalcy.

paintings. The next four paintings show even more marked
change and then symbols and hallucinations begin to appear.

The last picture suggests an acute phase of confusion and
gives a vivid impression of movement. Finally his pictures
returned to normal and resemble the first one shown.

THE FAMOUS CASE
OFALOYSE
Aloyse is one of the most famous names
In the history of pathological art. A
children's governess from Lausanne,
Switzerland, Aloyse became ill with
schizophrenia in 1918 and was committed
to a mental hospital. There she took up
drawing and painting and was soon
turning out vividly coloured works of
great beauty. Her output was prolific.
The more paintings she produced the
calmer she became. She specialized in
paintings of women famous in history
for their passionate love affairsCleopa¬
tra, Brunhilde, Mary Queen of Scots,
Maria Walewska, Josephine de Beauhar-
nais. A book on Aloyse as a case history
on the role of art in dealing with mental
disorders was written by a Swiss doctor, M.
Forel. "In her drawings," he wrote,
"the woman always has the leading place.
She is tall, beautiful and sensual; the
man is an inferior being relegated into
the background, strange and uncouth,
small and Ill-formed. The paintings of
Aloyse were not just an idle pastime.
Through her art she strove to give form
to the world of her fevered imagination,
and life and freedom to the creatures of
her fancy. As she herself put it: 'I saw
this living body and I told it to get' out of
the frame.' In her works a magic change
materialized and restored her security
in the world she had thus created." Photo
shows her imaginative rendering of "Mary
Queen of Scots or the Snake Necklace."
'PARADISE ON EARTH'
This coloured crayon drawing is the work
of a man who was hospitalized because
of an acute persecution complex accom¬
panied by strong feelings of jealousy
towards his wife. His drawing began
with and stemmed from his illness. In
this drawing, "Adam and Eve Turned
Out of Paradise", he has depicted the
earthly paradise (with trees bearing golden
apples and animals) in the abdomen of
God. From God's mouth come the
biblical words condemning the original
sinTo the serpent: A woman shall
crush thy head; to Adam: In the sweat
of thy face shalt thou eat bread ; to Eve:
In sorrow thou shalt bring forth children.

Sacha-Masour, Paris
This drawing was done by a mental patient suffering from acute schizophrenia, combined with a strong persecution complex. As is the
case for so many victims of mental illness, art helped this patient to find an outlet for her fears and calmed her obsessions.
I DRAW AND MY
PHOBIAS VANISH
The woman who did these drawings was
a schizophrenic obsessed by sadistic and
masochistic feelings. She was incapable of
explaining In words or in writing the thoughts
that went through her mind. A few weeks
after her illness she found a new outlet for
her distress in drawing. She was later able
to tell her doctors: "When I draw, some of the
things inside me come out and my obsessions
disappear. I don't try to show a person or a
thing ; only what they suggest to me." Top
left of drawing shows a bird of prey attacking
a guinea pig (she raised guinea pigs) ; top
right, the patient depicts herself as a woman
with a snake's skin. Bottom left, she draws
herself as a little girl trying to break the arm
of a small devil ; bottom right, an octopus
writing and swallowing a whole guinea pig.

THE EVOLUTION
OF A CAT
The artist who becomes mentally ill does not
necessarily lose his creative ability, and thus
the works he produces offer a deep insight
into the sick man's mind. One of the best
known British artists in the early part of the
century was Louis Wain who lived surround¬
ed by cats that he used as models for
exceedingly popular] drawings. In the early
1920's Wain had a schizophrenic breakdown
(split personality) with intermittent relapses
until his death in 1936. Here we see the
remarkable changes that occurred in his cat
portraits as his schizophrenia evolved.

### 65245: The Boy who didn't grow up
THE BOY WHO DIDN'T GROW UP
by Dr Tsung-yi Lin
Recently an eighteen-year-old boy came to my
attention; he was getting on badly at the shop
where he worked. Being the only son of a widowed
mother, he had been reluctant to leave his home and go to
work with others in a shop. For the first six months
there, he was too shy to talk to customers or strangers,
and "yes" or "no" were the only words that came out of
his mouth. He was timid and passive, but quite friendly
and warm in relation to people. When asked about his
future plans he always referred to his mother. Active
participation in social activity or recreation outside of
home were quite unthinkable to him. Other boys of his
age teased him and he had developed symptoms of
sleeplessness, palpitation and absent-mindedness.
This boy illustrates some of the difficulties of the
transition from childhood to manhood. Here was an
extreme case of an adolescent who failed to wean psycho¬
logically from being dependent on his mother. The
mother was described as a loving, warm person who did
everything to make her son's life comfortable and easy.
The separation from this sort of life was too painful for
this boy whose dependent personality, nurtured by his
over-protective mother, was not strong enough to meet the
challenge of everyday social life.
To become a full member of a society is an exciting and
important event for most children and also for the society
to which they belong. The observance of "rites de pas¬
sage" (initiation ceremonies) in almost every primitive
society indicates the importance attached to this transi¬
tion from the status of a child dependent upon parents to
that of a man, fully-fledged, and capable of taking his
place as a responsible member of society.
The primary interest of society is to ensure the continua¬
tion of the social system. For this, the adolescents must
be educated to become transmitters of the social heritage.
For the adolescents this transition represents a crucial
period of life, in which they come to physical, sexual, in¬
tellectual, emotional and social maturity.
'Born' rebel was 'home made'
This transition, however, is not always an easy and
smooth process as the example given above shows.
The fact that the rituals of initiation into manhood
or womanhood in many instances take the manifestations
of bodily mutilation, circumcision, symbolic rebirth, etc.
well dramatizes the pains involved in it.
The complete separation of the adolescents from their
close attachment to parents, the forced submission of the
younger generation to the authority of the older genera¬
tion and the acceptance of the tribal lore and expected
patterns of behaviour and attitudes, and the assumption
of legitimate sexual and social responsibility, all these
have deep emotional significance to the adolescents.
Here is another case of an adolescent who failed in one
or another aspect of this process and suffered from the
resultant emotional difficulties.
Occasional running away from home and association
Dr Tsung-yi Lin is Professor of Psychiatry at the National
Taiwan University. He has had a long teaching and practising
career at the Taiwan Medical School and at the National Tai¬
wan University Hospital and has done post-graduate studies in
both the United States of America and Europe. His numerous
scientific publications include a study of mental disorder in
Chinese and other cultures.
with delinquent youngsters were the main reasons why
this nineteen-year-old boy was brought to me for
consultation. He remained silent with an expression of
strong hatred throughout the first interview and made
no response to his father's complaints about his conduct.
His father, a principal of a middle school, went into detail
about how much he had tried to correct his son's
misconduct, and described him as a "born rebel." Frequent
preaching of Confucian ethics, constant watch on his
conduct both at school and home, strict selection of his
reading material, a ban on modern movies, and all the
father's other efforts, had merely driven the boy to the
opposite extreme. The boy felt that his father thought
nothing of him, that he never got any warm consideration
from his father, and that he could not live up to his
father's high expectations.
This is a good example of the failure of an adolescent
boy to accept the expected pattern of behaviour set by
his father. His reaction consisted of revolt mainly in a
group of his own age. This is characteristic of
adolescents.
The need to be needed by others
The failure of grown-ups to recognize and understand
the basic needs of adolescents is usually the main
single factor that prevents their sound development
into adulthood.
These needs are:
the need to be needed by others; the need for increasing
independence; the need to achieve adequate adjustment
to the opposite sex, and the need to re-think the cherished
beliefs of one's elders.
With the gratification of these needs the adolescent
becomes increasingly aware of himself in relation to his
past and future and to. others and attempts to construct
an interpretive view of what life means. The moral habits
and opinions formed in his childhood are re-examined
and put into a coherent scheme to become the basis of
his philosophy.
How are we to help adolescents to achieve a smooth and
successful transition into adulthood? There is still no
universal answer to this critical problem of our times. All
the world over, societies are suffering more and more from
the failure of this transition manifested in the form of
mental ill-health among the young and juvenile
delinquency in particular. This seems to be unavoidable
at a time of continual change which has caused confusion
of the system of values, ethical standards and beliefs even
of the grown-ups.
This does not imply that change itself always results in
confusion. It is change without clear sense of direction
that is responsible for creating anxiety and insecurity,
and which often leads to morbid manifestations of these
psychological difficulties.
The realization by adults of their own limitations in
modern societies may enable them to take a more humble,
sympathetic and tolerant attitude towards young' people,
and thus help the latter to work out their own problem
more constructively.
Just as the complex nature of the human child requires
for its growth such a unique and long period protected by
its parents, so the complex modern man requires a much
longer preparatory adolescent period to enable him to find
his place in a complex modern society.

The Unesco Courier. May 1959
Letters to the Editor
PUTTING WIND TO WORK
Sir,
I read your issue on the uses of
solar energy with the greatest interest.
It seems to me that an issue of The
Unesco Courier devoted to the use of
wind power would arouse considerable
interest. Wind power is used on a much
greater scale at present than solar energy.
Scant as our information is, we do
know that work directed towards the
wide scale use of wind power is being
conducted in the United States, Great
Britain, France, Denmark, India and
other countries. A great deal is being
done to this end in the U.S.S.R. Wind
like water is one of the cleanest sources
of energy; it leaves no waste products.
JJ. Shefter
Moscow, U.S.S.R.
Editor's note: Articles on the uses of
wind energy appeared in the August-
September 1955 issue (Harnessing Power
from Desert Winds, by E.W. Golding)
and the July 1957 number (France's
Giant Machine on Big Wind Hill, by
the same author).
ERUPTION OF VESUVIUS
Sir,
You state that "formidable explosive
eruptions" "commonly occur in craters
that have so long been dormant that
lava from the last eruption has had
time to solidify", and you quote as an
example the eruption of Vesuvius in
79 AD.
The eruption of Vesuvius in 79 A.D.
however, followed upon another one a
few years before that, which had
already caused considerable damage.
People were actually still busy repairing
some of the damage, among it that in
the Villa dei Mysteri, when the eruption
overcame Pompeii, at the same time
destroying and preserving it.
E.F. Blumberg
London
Editor's note: We thank our reader for
his supplementary information. In The
Unesco Courier article, however, the
eruption of Vesuvius in 79 A.D. was
not quoted as an example of the type
of eruption caused through the stopping
up of a volcano's "throat" by solidified
lava. It merely headed a list of history's
most destructive eruptions.
NEW LOOK FOR OLD TONGUES
Sir,
I was most interested to read about
the introduction of the Latin alphabet
in China which was described by Chou
You-Kuang in an article which appeared
some time ago (luly 1957) in The
Unesco Courier. Could you tell me
something about a similar and urgent
need concerning the Amharic alphabet
of Ethiopia which is made up of more
than 300 characters.
C. Curchod
Lausanne, Switzerland
Editor's note: The two situations are
not really comparable. Literary Chinese
has many thousands of separate
characters whereas the Amharic alpha¬
bet, of 247 syllabic characters, can be
reduced to a basic set of 37 consonants
nearly all of which can be combined
with seven different vowels. The pres¬
ervation of the Amharic language is
today the task of the Imperial Ethiopian
Academy in Addis Ababa. Besides
encouraging correct use of vocabulary,
grammar and style, the Academy is to
compile and publish a dictionary of the
Amharic language. An important part
of its work is to be the determination
of Amharic equivalents for foreign
scientific and technical terms used in
research, education, industry and
commerce. Of particular interest to
foreign scholars is the official system of
transliteration into and from the
Amharic and Latin alphabets to be
prepared by the Academy.

SPACE VIEW OF SMOG
Sir,
I have just read your March issue,
"Smog: Must We Use Our City Air as
a Sewer" which I found both provoc¬
ative and informative. I enclose a
cartoon recently published in the New
York Herald Tribune which I find most
apposite.
R. Stimson
Orléans, France
Editor's note: The Unesco Courier
would be interested in receiving drawings
or cartoons appearing in the world's
press on various aspects of education,
science and culture. Readers submitting
such material should indicate the name
of periodical and date of publication.
THE RIGHT « PRESCRIPTION *
Sir,
I have received my December
copy of The Unesco Courier and I
write to thank you for yet another fine
issue. I also wish to congratulate you
on publishing the letters from the
two French doctors adversely critical
though they were.
Dr. Paul Noel of Chaville complains
as to both the Courier's matter and its
method of presentation. He wants both
mental relaxation and intellectual
stimulus and the Courier provides him
with neither. Poor disillusioned doctor
in expecting a relatively inexpensive
journal, catering for the average citizen
of the world, to meet all his own mental
needs! The complaints of your other
critic, Dr. Doreau of Paris, are that
the Courier is weak and "is influenced
by a puerile need to popularize" and
that it "is likely to prove harmful to
your activities." But surely popular¬
ization of UNESCO's ideals is the very
purpose for which the Courier exists.
In my view, The Unesco Courier
has made a better diagnosis as to the
wants of the world citizen than the
learned French doctors, and the
treatment it serves up meets the needs
of the large majority of its clientèle.
And so I wish that still more ink may
flow to the understanding pens of your
staff and more film to their international
revealing cameras. As for the good
doctors, I hope they will continue to
subscribe to the Courier and that after
perusal they will display their copies in
their waiting rooms so that still more
citizens will become Unesco and
Courier minded.

WANTED! A YOUTH COUNCIL
Sir,
I was very delighted to read the letter
from Stan Marks in your December
issue. A U.N. Youth Council is really
a good idea. I know many youngsters
who want to do something, who realize
the dangerous situation of the world
and want to help as much as they can.
But what can they do? I am certain
they would gladly greet such a Youth
Council Their eagerness and ideals,
could from a strong organization around
the world. And so perhaps they would
have a better position, when it is their
turn to preserve the peace.
And if local councils are formed in
many places, everybody will get a better
contact with U.N. and understand it
better. I do not think it would cost very
much, because many youngsters are
ready to work for nothing. I hope
more people will write letters to The
Unesco Courier about this, then maybe
that could help to make the Youth
Council a reality. Thank you, Stan
Marks!

B EATING BACK THE DESERT:
The task of bringing desert lands under
cultivation has been taken a stage further
recently at the Beersheba Desert Research
Institute in Israel. The Institute is concerned
with three main kinds of research: the dis¬
covery and acclimatization of useful plants
that grow in desert areas; the use of solar
energy, for which a pilot plant which will
produce steam for industrial purposes is
being built; and experiments in the demin-
eralization of brackish underground water,
for which a new pilot plant and laboratory
is being built. The Beersheba Institute is
one of several pilot projects in arid zone
research receiving UNESCO's assistance.
'AUTO-MATH '59': To help spe¬
cialists in the applications of electronic
calculation to compare results obtained
in this field and to discuss methods and
techniques, an International Conference
on Information processing will be held
in Paris next month under UNESCO's
auspices. Some 1,500 specialists will
hear and discuss reports on such themes
as methods of digital computing; logical
design of computors; common symbolic
language for computors; automatic trans¬
lation of languages; pattern recognition
and machine learning. At the same time
the first international exhibition of infor¬
mation processing equipment "Auto-
Math '59" will be held in Paris.
M. HEATRE OF THE NATIONS:
Spectators at this year's Theatre of the Na¬
tions Season in Paris will be able to com¬
pare interpretations of various Shakespear¬
ean dramas presented by troupes from Ger¬
many, Italy, Hungary, Holland, Czecho¬
slovakia and the U.S.S.R. The four-month
season which continues into luly includes
some 30 dramatic operatic and choreogra¬
phic productions to be presented by 22 trou¬
pes from 18 countries. A series of puppet
plays will be presented by companies from
Poland, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Japan and
France.
TRAVELLER'S GUIDE TO VACCI¬
NATION: What vaccinations do you
need to travel abroad? The question is
answered in "Vaccination Requirements
for International Travel" published by
the World Health Organization, which
lists vaccinations imposed or recommen¬
ded by some 180 countries and terri¬
tories ranging from Aden to Zanzibar.
The booklet is based on WHO's Inter¬
national Sanitary Regulations governing
land, sea and air travel which aim to
ensure maximum security against the
international spread of disease with
minimum interference to world traffic.
B EACONS IN OUTER SPACE:
Artificial satellites of the sun may well serve
as "guides" for future travellers in outer
space, according to Professor Vassily Sifo-
rov of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.
Soviet scientists, he says, are now working
on the theory that sun satellites could be¬
come permanent radio beacons whose
signals would be used by the first space
ships to be sent to the moon, Mars and
Venus to find their bearings in outer space.
AID FOR PRISONERS OF THE
DARK: In recent years prisoners in
Osaka Penitentiary, Japan's largest pri¬
son, have translated several thousand
books into Braille. Working voluntarily
in their spare time they have made
Braille books of all kinds, including
scientific and religious works and chil¬
dren's books, for the library of the Light
House, the Osaka centre for the blind.
The work began in 1953 after Takeo
Iwahashi, blind founder of The Light
House, made an appeal at the prison for
those who are "imprisoned in darkness" .
Three of the original twenty translators
are to make Braille translation their life's
work.
PLANTS GIVE 'SMOG' ALARM:
Plants may be used in the near future as
alarm signals of air pollution according to
a World Health Organization expert com¬
mittee report. Leafy vegetables such as
spinach, romaine, endive (chicory) and also
celery are injured by "smog" and show cha¬
racteristic lesions which appear as a
bronzing or silvering of the leaf.
DICTIONARY OF THE THEATRE:
The Executive Committee of the Inter¬
national Theatre Institute recently gave
its approval to the final proofs of a dic¬
tionary of technical terms of the theatre.
To be published in eight languages, this
dictionary will be a valuable aid for ex¬
changes between national theatres.
Other decisions of the I.T.I. Executive
Committee: to create a Latin-American
Theatre Institute in Santiago de Chile;
to discuss the avant garde tendencies of
the contemporary theatre at next month's
I.T.I. Congress in Helsinki, Finland; and
to support an exchange programme un¬
der which each I.T.I, national committee
will help young writers to establish rela¬
tions with colleagues abroad who may
help them to translate their plays or put
them in touch with producing companies.
U.IV. STAMP EXHIBITION: A
unique exhibition featuring stamps of the
United Nations will be held at Unesco
Headquarters in Paris from May 16 to 18
under the auspices of the Minister of the
French Postal Administration and organized
by the European service of the U.N. Postal
Administration in collaboration with
Unesco. It will include an exposition of
postage stamps and first day covers issued
by the U.N. and a film on the activities of
the U.N. Postal Administration. The
French postal authorities will open a
temporary office from which all out-going
mail will receive a special cancellation
marking honouring the exhibition. Unesco
will be issuing two special philatelic items,
a souvenir envelope and postcard, each
affixed with two different stamps. These
souvenirs may be purchased at the Unesco
Gift Shop from May 16 to 18, and after¬
wards by addressing orders to Unesco Gift
Shop, UNESCO STAFF SERVICE, Place
de Fontenoy, Paris (7e).
M UNESCO HELPS TO REBUILD A
PRINTING HOUSE: Severely dam¬
aged in a fire, the Government Printing
House at Kabul, the capital of Afgha¬
nistan, is being rebuilt with the help of
grants both from national banks and
from Unesco (Unesco aid amounts to
$4,000). One Afghan newspaper, re¬
porting on the grant, has commented:
"We greatly appreciate this aid, because
helping a printing house means helping
education and culture the main factors
in raising the cultural standards of the
world's people."
WORLD'S TRANSLATIONS: SHAKESPEARE 3rd
A world-wide view of translations and of the extent and variety of the inter¬
lingual diffusion of books is given in the latest edition of Index Translationum (1),
UNESCO'S annual International Bibliography of Translations. The new edition
lists 27,978 translations which appeared in 1957 in 65 countries and these show
that, as in previous years, the U.S.S.R. holds top place as the country with the
greatest number 4,608 in the various languages of the Soviet Union. Following
this comes Germany (Federal Republic and Democratic Republic) with 2,041,
followed by France, Japan, Italy, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Sweden and
Rumania, all with more than 1,000 translations each.
The alphabetical listing of authors, covering 64 pages, shows that the most
translated is Lenin 278 translations (of which 185 are in the various languages
of the U.S.S.R.); Jules Verne follows with 121 translations (of which 30 were
published in Spain, 12 in the U.S.S.R.); Shakespeare has third place with
120 translations. Then come three Russian authors: Tolstoy (94), Dostoievsky
(82) and Gorki (78). Agatha Christie is next with 76 translations (19 of them in
Japan and 15 in Spain). She is just ahead of Engels (72) who precedes Simenon
and Somerset Maugham, each with 67.
Literary works, especially novels, account for more than half the translations
(15,407). unesco obtains the facts published in the Index Translationum from
national libraries or from its National Commissions in various countries, and the
work thus gives a vast and valuable view on translations appearing in more than
200 languages throughout the world.

Education
and
mental health
A report b»xtti upon the work of a European conference
called by Unesco at tie Mu.rr Pédagogique ¡n Pari»,
NovemberDecember 1952
by W. D. Wau.
Unesco
Here is a book which every parent, teacher and youth worker should
read. It is indeed a book which every adult can read with profit,
for all have passed through the stages of childhood and adolescence
and experienced the effects of education, both at home and school, on
their present mental health.
Based on the results of a conference convened by Unesco which grouped
some 30 educational administrators, educators, psychologists, social
workers and psychiatrists, "Education and Mental Health" represents a
stocktaking of current European thinking on the subject. All the infor¬
mation gleaned during the three week conference completed by a conti¬
nuous study over two further years in collaboration with experts in 20 coun¬
tries, was carefully sifted, coordinated and written into a readable whole
by Dr. W. D. Wall, programme specialist in child development and for¬
merly Reader in Education at the University of Birmingham.
"Mental development is an uninterrupted process and it is never too
early to take steps to avoid possible causes of a disturbed balance, if we
are finally to achieve that flowering of the personality and that readiness
to co-operate which are the two main aims of education", writes Prof.
Jean Piaget, the well known Swiss child psychologist, in a preface to the
book. For this reason, since they were ultimately concerned with social
adaptation and international understanding, the experts at the conference
and the author of the book surveyed the whole field of education from
early childhood to secondary schools, concluding with a valuable chapter
on the training of teachers.
This is a comprehensive survey of education for mental health and it
not only takes into account present teaching methods but dwells on such
problems as large classes, cramped housing and town flats, working
mothers, the danger of separating infant from mother and placing him in
a nursery school before the age of two at the earliest, sex education and
religious teaching both at home and in the school, co-education and the
interdépendance of the intellectual and emotional life.
Parents lack of individual satisfaction in work, a result of industriali¬
zation and a rising standard of material life, is also underlined as a factor
dangerous to the mental health of children.
An extensive bibliography of reference works and a chapter on psycho¬
logical services complete this publication which is within the reach of all
concerned with the fundamental problem of mental health.

A CHILD'S
LONELINESS
On the rim of a cold wasteland, chilly lighted by a pale sun and a weird moon, is a frightened little
figure, apparently waiting, hopelessly and helplessly, for the nameless terrors lurking beyond the
frame of the picture. The drawing was made by a little seven-year-old girl. Apsychiatristafterstudy-
ing it wrote: "She is frightened, shy and withdrawn. She feels all alone in the great vastness of
her world... Her attitude bespeaks depression and a fear of dying for the love she needs and must
have to survive. The skull head symbolizes death ; her standing on a thin line, the
precariousness of her position and the imminence of death without the needed love and protection."
