Fabulous bird-woman
This strange creature, half-bird, half-woman, is an extremely rare piece of lustre-painted
Iranian pottery, standing over 2 ft. high, fashioned nearly 800 years ago at Ray, near Teheran.
These mythological beings were traditional in Moslem iconography, but ordinarily appeared
only as part of a decorative motif on ceramics, metalware and textiles. The same fantastic
beasts, known as harpies, figure in ancient Greek lore as wind spirits or sirens. This imposing
ceramic dates from the Middle Islamic period of Iranian ceramics, when the city of Ray
was renowned for the wares of its skilled and inventive potters.

View of the ruins of Persepolis, the royal
city created by Darius I, its massive
carvings, gateways and walls recalling
the splendours of ancient Persia. 2,500
years ago ritual processions trod this
ceremonial stairway leading to the palaces
and audience halls of Persepolis.
This issue of the "Unesco Courier"
is published to mark an important
date: the 2,500th anniversary of
the founding of Iran. Unesco's
General Conference, recognizing
the importance of Iranian civi¬
lization in world history and its
"links with other civilizations over
a period of twenty-five centuries",
last year adopted a resolution
calling on Unesco and its Member
States to co-operate with the
Iranian authorities in this com¬
memoration. The Editors hope
that the presentation in this issue
of a few of the features of Iranian
culture and civilization brief and
incomplete though they may be
will help to spark a more profound
interest in the great traditions of
Persia which are as alive today as
they were two millennia ago.

known, the ordering and interchanges
of an imperial state whose beginnings
had been traced by the Babylonians
and Assyrians.
Once the latter had been conquered
by the Iranians, the "law of the Medes
and Persians which changeth not"
sheltered the development of civiliza¬
tion from the Aegean Sea to the
Indian Ocean.
Significantly, the Acheamenids sup¬
plied their own word for "law", data,
which passed into Armenian, Hebrew
and Akkadian, to signify what Is
meant by its root meaning, "to
arrange" or "put in order".
The ancient languages which adopt¬
ed this word indicate the Achaemenid
Empire's dominance over an area
which included the Caucasus and
Armenia, Israel on the Mediterranean
seabord, and the Tigris-Euphrates
Basin. It also stretched into Central
Asia in the northeast, and Asia Minor
in the west.
From the crossroads the Medes and
then the men of Persis, Cyrus and
Darius, marched along routes which
quartered the compass, to create the
model of the universal, cosmopolitan
state.
During the reign of Artaxerxes I
(466-424 B.C.) Greek historians and
men of science travelled in the Em¬
pire to acquire the learning of the East.
Had Democritus (d. 361 B.C.) not
met Babylonian scholars and mathe¬
maticians under the aegis of the
Achaemenid Empire, he would prob¬
ably not have worked out his atomic
theory. His father had entertained
the Emperor Xerxes when the Iranian
"Great King" had been in Thrace in
about 460 B.C.
Leaving those ancient eras when
Iran set the style for uniting nations,
the more recent Islamic culture can be
cited as a phenomenon which would

not have existed without contributions
made in cities such as Baghdad,
Bukhara, Herat, Ray, Isfahan, Shiraz
and Tabriz from the 8th to the 17th cen¬
turies A.D. There the poetry, faience,
architecture, metalwork, miniature
painting and calligraphy which are the
characteristic adornments of Moslem
culture were perfected.
The ethos of all these cities was
Iranian, so extensive had former Per¬
sian empires been. Baghdad, from 750
to 1258 the seat of the Caliphs of
Islam, who were Islam's religious and
juridical heads, is near the site of
Ctesiphon on the Tigris, and Ctesi-
phon's great arch still stands as the
memorial of the splendour of the win¬
ter capital of the Persian Sassanid
Empire (224-651 A.D.). Bukhara and
Herat were jewels in north-eastern
Iran, where Achaemenid and Sassanid
influence reached the Oxus and Hindu
Kush, and the Persian language pre¬
vails to this day.
Islam was the faith revealed In the
seventh century to the Arabian
Prophet Mohammed. Shortly after his
death the Arabs' expansion at Iran's
and Byzantium's expense made Islam
inheritor of an Iranian civilization whose
beginnings are traceable to 4000 B.C.
Then a pottery existed on the Iranian
Plateau with designs which reveal
that the leap from realism into abstract
stylization had already been made;
made first of all by prehistoric Iranian
potters.
From this discovery it is evident how
in the clear atmosphere characteristic
of Iran, man's genius was early divert¬
ed from observation and imitation of
natural objects to transmuting obser¬
vation into the ordering of abstract
design.
Objects seen animals poised to
spring, birds in flight were transform¬
ed into universal concepts by the
ingenuity of prehistoric Iranians, and
Iranians have maintained this capacity
to universalize the particular in their
arts ever since, thus displaying the
highest mark of civilization.
The art of those first potters can
be seen again in the bounding gazelles
and partridges on the wing that
decorate the pages of sixteenth cen¬
tury manuscripts as motifs incidental
to more fully developed scenes, of
princes carousing or embattled against
backgrounds of landscapes which are
in a Chinese style and include tents
from the Steppes of Central Asia; or
of philosophers such as Avicenna (Ibn
Sina), discoursing to pupils on themes
preserved from defunct Greek schools,
but taught in medieval Iranian college
courtyards.
The clarity of the Iranian climate is

in great part the key to this type of
achievement in the visual arts, as later
it will be seen to have been to the
development of religious attitudes.
It is a special quality of Iranian
conditions, by which all comers are
captivated and mentally and spiritually
enhanced. To it should be added the
abrasive quality of rugged mountain
topography and parched plains, drama¬
tically relieved by the luxuriance of
gardens and coppices in places
where carefully husbanded, sparse
water supplies meet cultivable soil.
Wine and genius may be said to
be natural to Iran, whose middle posi¬
tion between eastern and western
continents has always ensured that its
genius had much to feed on, much to
transmute into something vital and
new.

CULTURAL CROSSROADS (Continued)
from others have frequently been com¬
mented on. But rarely has this been
done with enough emphasis on the
original genius and absolute and un¬
changing characteristics distinctly
Iranian, to make "borrowing" fresh,
hitherto unthought-of development,
mere imitation being out of the question.
The record can be corrected when
it Is recognized that the toughness of
Iranian conditions, combined with the
possibilities of achieving great refine¬
ment of living, art and intellect, have
forged a human resilience and pre¬
sence of mind to which others have
invariably succumbed, never succeed¬
ing in erasing the influence and effects
of Iranian talent, however calamitously
they may have assaulted the Iranian
land.
Thus, to a greater extent than a rival
Greek might have seen fit to report,
Iranians have received less than they
have exported, or given to their not
always invited guests. Invaders have
been of inferior culture, attracted by
Iran's superior civilization and quickly
conquered by it. From Arabs out of
the desert and nomads from the Asia¬
tic steppes Iran could hope to receive
little but an influx of fresh vitality and
the arduous challenge of refining it
into the Iranian way of life.
This Is to speak as if Iran had
always been, and that not success¬
fully, on the defensive. On the offen¬
sive against the ancient Greeks, Iran
came into Europe and in its turn pro¬
vided the challenge which broadened
the Hellenes' horizon and, for example,
in Xenophon's Cyropaedia, gave the
world a Greek philosophical tale,
based on the examples furnished by
Iranian ' monarchy, and, interestingly
-enough, written in a strikingly Persian
style of exemplary political polemic.
Iranians brought Europe lucerne, the
fodder of their famous cavalry, and
also the domestic fowl, the white dove,
and the peacock. Darius had fruit
trees from his eastern provinces trans¬
planted to regions west of the Euphra¬
tes. The pistachio was taken to Syria,
rice to Mesopotamia, sesame to Egypt,
all within the confines of ancient
Iranian empires. The Shahinshah's
favourite wines, however, failed to
flourish in Damascus.
Salted fish from the Persian Gulf
was eaten in Asia Minor and part of
Egypt's tribute to Iran was paid in
revenue from the Mediterranean and
Nile fisheries; the statecraft of the
Achaemenid King of Kings accom¬
plished and maintained in balance the
first and one of the vastest of amal¬
gams of human resources.
Iranian initiative has repeatedly
revived this dream of the universal
state. Alexander the Great himself,
to win his subordinates' approval, after
they had reproached him for having be¬
come too Iranian in outlook, destroyed
the Achaemenid's cosmopolitan amal¬
gamation in 331 B.C.
Long afterwards, when through
Iranian intrepidity and that of Iranized
Arabs the Moslem Caliphate of Bagh¬
dad rose in 750 A.D., the stage was
set for another far-reaching amalga¬
mation of human forces and global
resources: the Perso-Moslem unity.
Geography has endowed the occu¬
pants of the Iranian uplands with a
very wide theatre in which to spread
the operations and influence of their
genius. They overlook the Oxus
basin and plains of Asia in the north¬
east, the Tigris-Euphrates valley and
Arabian Desert in the south-west, the
Hindu Kush and Indian Sub-Continent
in the east and south-east.
The Caucasus rises in the north and
the Persian Gulf girdles the southern
shores of what is a many-doored
caravanserai, the middle realm bet¬
ween Europe and Asia, Africa and
Siberia. Through Iran came the silk
and paper of China, the Indies' gold
and spices, the horses and hides of
Central Asia, to reach the Roman sea.
When an Iranian empire of old
expanded, it followed the ancient
world's primary arteries of trade bet¬
ween east and west. It supplemented
its wealth by tolls on merchandise,
upon whose raw materials it placed the
stamp of Iranian craftsmanship. It
touched the goods passing through its
hands with the quickening lumin¬
osity of the Iranian mind; with that art
which the early potters on the Per¬
sian plateau had practised.
Not only were designs and images
passed on, so that patterns were
spread on cloth or woven into car¬
pets to speak the world over of
how an Iranian weaver sees flowers,
the delicate poplar, the bird on the
bough, the very colours of Iranian soil
and Iranian contrasts of red, deep
blue and green. Religious ideas were
also exported, to lie deep in Judaism,
Christianity, and profoundly to shape
the Islamic faith Iran took as its own.
Darius's vines transplanted to
Damascene soil may not have taken
there, but aspects of the ritual of
Iran's ancient Zoroastrian religion have
their place in the wine of the Christian
Eucharist.
The heavenly galaxies nightly shine
more brightly on a land most of which
is over four thousand feet above sea-
level, than they do on mistier, more
low-lying regions. There is never a
day without the light of the sun in the
country whose mythical king Hushang
discovered how to produce fire, his
son Jamshid making the festival of
Nauruz, the New Year, mark the vernal
equinox.
Iran's brightness Is reflected in the
enamel-like brilliance both of its visual
arts and the imagery of its exquisite
poetry. The sense of Heaven being
almost within reach has developed
the Iranian spiritual genius to a degree
which makes the Persian people
naturally religious, so that their liter¬
ature and art seem always unavoidably
communicative of the Grace of God.
Their spirituality confers on them
both their innate and abiding yearn-

ing for a greater perfection than the
world immediately offers, and their
peculiar power to lend lustre to what¬
ever they handle. It offers them the
hope of grace, but also engenders
pessimism and scepticism about the
mortal state. Nevertheless, in Iran
spirituality and pragmatism are so
balanced that to its poetry the world
may turn for enlightenment and con¬
solation when other sources of inspir¬
ation fail to assuage human despair.
Asia and Europe are fortunate to be
bridged by a land whose brightness
could supplant the Mongols' clouded
superstition by vision, so that as an
Iranian ruler, even a descendant of
Chingiz Khan, Ghazan (1295-1304),
became a polymath and, while dismis¬
sing the vanities of alchemy, kept Its
processes, aware of the scientific
value of experiment.
It was the Iranian brightness which
taught Mohammed the Prophet's suc¬
cessors that they were not only the
keepers of Moslem law. Theirs also
to keep was a revelation which ans¬
wered man's most exalted spiritual
aspirations. The Iranian Sufi mystics

have kept clear for mankind the con¬
cept which the example of Moham¬
med, God's Chosen Apostle, con¬
veyed: that men's hearts when purified
may become the mirror of God's
unblemished light.
The bridging role has, however,
brought vicissitudes. The Iranian spir¬
it's strength and resilience have often
been severely tried. It is well for the
world that they have emerged from
these trials as keen, flexible and
unbreakable as well-tempered steel,
for the world can still derive a great
deal from Iran that is beneficial in
the cultural and political spheres.
A crossroads is a vantage point from
which to observe the ways of men in
their different regions and contexts.
It is also the place in which a people
possessed, through a long and eventful
history, of an almost unparallelled
.experience of human affairs can set up
the signposts commonly to be found
at crossroads.
At the Iranian junction of history,
cultures and indigenous aptitude, Eu¬
rope can be explained to Asia and Asia
can teach Europe. Iran's windows are
like the faces of Janus. Iran is a
sharp-eyed, keenly observant Janus.
Modern Iran now possesses resour¬
ces and has regained the self-confi¬
dence lost in the thraldom and period
of foreign domination and exploitation
which began in 1722 when the Safa-
vid dynasty lost power.
Now Iran again commands inter¬
national respect. It both can and does
play a positive rôle in world affairs.
As a member of the United Nations it
sets the pace for other developing
countries, and has become the obvious
milieu for international conventions for
the discussion of such topics as nutri¬
tion, agricultural development, illiter¬
acy, the rights of women.
It is thus once more the centre
where ideas and techniques may be
pooled, to meet the problems of the
less technologically advanced Orient
with the experience and skills of the
more technologically advanced Occi¬
dent, Iran acting as the catalyst.
Seekers of solutions to the world's
problems could have no more gener¬
ous and perfect hosts than the Ira¬
nians, whose courtesy is rightly pro
verbial and has been almost since
time began; but whose long exper¬
ience as the guardians of civilization
against the encroachment of desert
sands, of rapacious enemies, of chaos
and disorderliness makes them more
than gracious hosts.
The slightest realization of what
Iran has achieved in Improving Its
own domestic well-being since 1960,
and this measured against the former
drain of its old resources, and its in¬
capacity for over a century during
modern times to act Independently,
will demonstrate that the potentiality
alluded to here is not exaggerated.
A wider ranging study of Iran's his¬
tory, and a proper understanding of
its geographical position in a world in
which the East is stirring into new life,
will amply reinforce the argument that
confidence in Iran's capacity for show¬
ing initiative and vitality, and willing¬
ness to accord it the respect it deser¬
ves, could procure for the world the
contribution of a stabilizing force
that a region which might easily
become greatly disturbed urgently
requires.

### 53891: The Scientific legacy of Iran
The scientific
legacy of Iran
by Desmond Stewart
I ODERN man lives longer,
in an environment increasingly under¬
stood, thanks in part to the labours
of the turbaned scientists of medieval
Iran. The munificence of their scien¬
tific contribution indeed constitutes a
mystery which some writers have
tried to unlock by invoking race.
Climate and geography are more
rational keys. Iran's climate, torrid
in summer and in winter icy, at once
stimulated and hardened its sons.
Its position as the mountainous
turntable linking India, Central Asia,
the Middle East and Europe entailed
invasions by Greeks and Arabs from
the west, by Seljuk Turks and Mongols
from the east; its people were thus
thrown in vivid contact with varied
traditions.
Iran's own periods of attack, when
Persian armies moved east or west,
played their role in mixing a distinctive
blend of humanism, speculation and
practicality.
Since the Iranian character typically
expressed itself in what was useful
as well as beautiful, an appropriate
point at which to begin a discussion
of Iranian science is medicine, a
science which modern man can
acclaim without reserve.
Iran's medical tradition was already
old when the conquests of Alexander
the Great linked the Persian plateau
with the Hellenistic world. Persian
myth ascribed the introduction of the

DESMOND STEWART is a British author who
has written widely on the Middle East. The

world and Its influence on other cultures has

of the region from 1869 to the present day)
and "The Arab world".
healer's art to Jamshid, the legend¬
ary fourth hero and king of Iran.
Much later, the greatest Persian
historian of medicine, Ibn abl Usaybi'a
believed that so noble a science must,
like the Koran, have derived from
a revelation of God. With such ante¬
cedents, the Iranian physician, usually
deriving from a noble family, enjoyed
a loftier social position than his
confrères in the Greco-Roman world.
At the same time the Iranian open¬
ness to outside ideas made such his¬
torical kings as Cyrus and Darius
proud to have imported Egyptian phy¬
sicians (particularly those specialized
in the eye diseases common in the
dusty east) to their imperial courts.
The same tolerant spirit was later
instrumental in making Sassani.an Iran
the originator of medical schools. For
in the three centuries between the
conversion of Constantine and the
rise of Islam the Byzantine persecu¬
tion of heretics and pagans drove
east, first the Nestorian scholar-
physicians of Syria and then the last
Neo-PIatonists of Greece.
All found a hospitable welcome
across the border in south-west Iran.
One town, Jundishapur near the
modern Ahwaz, housed a cosmopolitan
university with a scientific bent, which
reached its zenith under the 6th cen¬
tury Núshírván, known to the west as
Khosroes the Great.
Most of the instruction in its medical
school was in Syriac, but its scholars
also spoke Sanskrit, Greek and early
Persian. Besides translating Greek
and Indian authors with an Eliza¬
bethan fervour, the university produced
original works. One Sassanian product
was a thirty-volume encyclopaedia
dealing with all then known poisons
and their properties.
The Arab invaders of the 7th century
respected Jundishapur, but their effect
on the Persian language was similar
to that of William the Conqueror on
Anglo-Saxon. Henceforth for some
centuries Arabic was the lingua franca
of all educated Moslems.
Yet far from restricting Persian
genius, the Islamic conquest gave it
a "global village' in which to act.
Iranian science particularly flourished
once the Abbasids moved the caliphal
capital from Damascus, close to the
Hellenistic Mediterranean, to the site
of Baghdad but a day's journey from
the Iranian foothills.
Baghdad was founded in the mid-
8th century by Mansur, a belligerent
caliph tormented by indigestion. Cured
by the chief physician of Jundish¬
apur (he was summoned to the capital
when Mansur's own doctors admitted
themselves defeated) the Caliph en¬
couraged an immigration of Iranian
scholars from Jundishapur, which
increased under his descendants.
The Abbasids lasted in Iran from
the 8th Century until their final defeat
by the Mongols in 1258. They not
only married Iranian women but
sponsored a cultural compost in which
Arabs largely dominated the studies
linked to language theology, poetry
and law while conceding to foreign¬
ers, and in particular Persians, what
we would think of as the physical or
practical sciences, but which they
termed "foreign".
Mansur's great-grandson, al-Ma'mun
(whose mother and wife were both
Persians) founded a "House of Wis¬
dom" comparable in cultural impor¬
tance to the Mouseion founded by
the Ptolemies in Alexandria more than
a thousand years before. Appropri¬
ately, much of the science of Alexan¬
dria was translated into Arabic, often
via Cyriac, for Ma'mun's Dar al-Hik-
mah (DAR).
T
HE institution's most
famous head was Hunayn ibn Ishaq,
born at Hira in Iraq. Hunayn pursued
the medical manuscripts of Galen with
a lover's passion. He was never
satisfied until he had obtained the
most accurate text available even if
this necessitated exhausting Middle
Eastern journeys.
Other scholars translated the geo¬
metry of Euclid, the Almagest of
Ptolemy as well as the works of
Archimedes, the greatest practical
scientist of the ancient world. It was
not until the late 12th century, three
hundred years after Hunayn's death,
that these works were restored to
Europe through the activities of men
such as Gerard of Cremona working
in Toledo at the frontiers of Christian
and Moslem Spain.
But Iranian physicians also made
original constributions both in the

### 53891: The Scientific legacy of Iran
As early as the 10th century
A.D. Persian scholars and craftsmen were
renowned for the design and manufacture
of astronomical instruments. These
17th century Persian astrolabes
instruments for taking the altitudes
of celestial bodies show the
delicacy of workmanship and precision
of design for which the work of Persian
astrolabe makers was prized
from Asia to Europe.

A study of the stars was part of the normal learning of the educated Persian
in medieval times. This representation of the constellation Virgo, shown as a
human figure with dots indicating the stars, illustrates a 10th century "Treatise
on the Fixed Stars" by an Iranian scholar, Abd ar-Rahman As-Sufi. The figure
is reproduced from a copy of As-Sufi's work made by his son in 1009 and now
preserved in the Department of Oriental Books, Bodleian Library, Oxford
(MS. Marsh 144, p. 223). Pictures in As-Sufi's treatise reveal a Moslem trans¬
formation of classical images of constellations as human figures, in both
dress and appearance, which is strongly Oriental, particularly for women.

### 53891: The Scientific legacy of Iran
One of the greatest legacies left by the Persians in the field of medicine Is their conception
of hospitals. The modern hospital, it has been said, is a direct growth of Persian foundations.
Doctors and teachers of medicine were drawn from Persia to staff hospitals and schools of
medicine in Baghdad and other cities. Painting (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York)
shows Persian pharmacists preparing medicine about 1224 A.D.
Ancient Persian medical books describe operations from trepanning of
the skull to excision of varicose veins. Persian doctors are credited
with using many chemical drugs of which the sulphonamides of today are
the heirs. This medieval Persian engraving shows a physician treating a
patient's ear.
Persian doctors not only developed new treatments with medicinal drugs, but adopted the
scientific methods of other peoples and modified them by their own discoveries. In hospitals
specialization was encouraged. This 12th century Persian miniature shows treatment
of the spinal column.
SCIENTIFIC LEGACY (Continued)
diagnosis of diseases (one was whoop¬
ing cough) and, most important of all,
in treatment. The modern hospital is
the lineal descendant of the Islamic
maristan, seen by Crusaders in the
Holy Land and visitors to Egypt. It
derived from Persia.
The greatest medieval clinician was
Razi, born near the modern Teheran
in 865. Living seven centuries before
the theory of bacteria was first pro¬
posed, Razi intuitively discerned the
importance of hygiene. When com¬
missioned to choose a site for a new
hospital In Baghdad, he hung joints
of fresh meat at different points round
the sprawling, circular city. Where
the meat took longest to decay, there
he sited his maristan.
Razi was a prolific writer, devoting
half of a reputed output of 200 works
to medicine. His description of small¬
pox, clearly differentiating it from other
disruptive ailments, enabled later phy¬
sicians both to diagnose the dread
disease and predict its course. His
treatment was based on good diet
and nursing amidst clean and comfort¬
able surroundings. It has not been
radically bettered since.
Razi's most important legacy was
his monumental encyclopaedia. In this
he recorded both the extensive clinical
observations which earned him his
honorific title "The Experienced" and
the collected knowledge of Greek,
Syrian, Arab, Hindu and Persian
doctors.
An equally versatile physician was
Ibn Sina (980-1037), the Latin version
of whose name, Avicenna, testifies to
a reputation that leapt the frontiers of
faith. It leapt centuries too. His
Canon of Medicine, a million-word
encyclopaedia dealing with the treat¬
ment of disease in all its aspects, was
the standard teaching text in European
universities from its translation into
Latin in the 12th century until the
medical revolution of the 17th: a record
for durability beaten only by Galen.
Razi and Ibn Sina, though living in
successive centuries, shared the poly-
mathic approach to learning character¬
istic of medieval Islam. The hundred
or so works of Razi which were not
concerned with medicine dealt with
alchemy, theology and astronomy;
Ibn Sina's non-medical writings treated
philosophy (in which he synthesized
Aristotle, Neo-Platonism and Islamic
theology), astronomy and mathematics.
As an interesting innovation, he wrote
some his books in Persian.
Persia was an important transmission
point for Hindu numerals in their
voyage to the west. They were first
publicized to the Islamic world in the
first half of the 9th century by al-
Khwarizmi, whose name shows that
he comes from a city just south of
the Aral Sea. Astronomer and geo¬
grapher, he also served as court
mathematician to al-Ma'mun, the
founder of the House of Wisdom.
By synthesizing Greek and Hindu
mathematical knowledge, al-Khwarizmi

### 53891: The Scientific legacy of Iran
influenced medieval mathematical
thought more than any other individual.
Yet there was again a surprising
time lag in the European acceptance
of Hindu numerals. Not until 1202
did Fibonacci (an Italian with North
African contacts) publish his oddly
named "Book of the Abacus"; this for
the first time explained the numeral
system which would, slowly, put paid
to the abacus.
Because the Hindu numerals, as
modified by Moslems, had by this
time been used by the Arabs of
North Africa for some centuries, Euro¬
peans designated them as Arabic;
others at the time called them
"Jewish", since the Jews were far in
advance of their Christian contempor¬
aries in knowledge of Islamic science.
Along with Hindu numerals, the
Hindu decimal system and the concept
of zero were transmitted through Ira¬
nian mathematicians such as al-Khwa-
rizml. The Arabic word for an empty
object, sifr, was translated as zephy-
rum in Latin. Besides using its Ital¬
ian* derivative zero, English keeps the
original sifr as "cipher".
The use of Hindu numerals and the
zero made it possible for al-Khwarizml
to compose the first easily intelligible
text-book on Algebra. The word prob¬
ably derives from al-Khwarizml's
Ketab al-Jabra wa'l-Muqabala, which
can be roughly paraphrased as "the
art of bringing together unknowns to
make a known quantity."
Al-Khwarizmi took three centuries to
reach the west. In 1126 Adelard of
Bath, an Englishman who had travelled
as far as the Middle East, translated
his astronomical tables, which included
tables of sines, into Latin. Adelard thus
introduced trigonometry to Europe.
Algebra was introduced through two
versions published in the same year,
1145. The first was made by John of
Chester (who had lived in Spain), the
second by Plato of Tivoli from the
Hebrew translation of his friend, Abra¬
ham bar Hiyya.
Sometimes an Iranian scientist
would be his own transmitter. An
outstanding example was al-Buruni,
roughly a contemporary of Ibn Sina's
and born, like the inventor of algebra,
in Khwarizm. As well as being a
mathematician, astronomer, encyclo¬
paedist and rational philosopher (he
argued that the exclamation "Allah
knows best!" was no excuse for
ignorance), al-Buruni was also a geo¬
grapher who travelled widely.
He translated works of Sanskrit
science into Arabic and at the same
time transmitted Moslem knowledge to
Hindus. Since he had himself accu¬
rately determined latitudes and longi¬
tudes and discussed the rotation of
the earth on its axis, he had much to
transmit.
One of the last great Iranian mathe¬
maticians died just a few years before
Adelard of Bath published his trans¬
lation of al-Khwarizmi. Omar Khayyam

time (mid 11th to early 12th century)
as a mathematician.
"His Algebra," George Sarton, the
historian of science, has written,
"contains geometric and algebraic
solutions of the second degree; an
admirable classification of equations,
including the cubic; a systematic
attempt to solve them all, and partial
geometric solutions of most of them."
His calendar was probably more accu¬
rate than the Gregorian.
The Mongol invasions shook the
foundations of Islamic culture. But it
is worth remembering one positive
result of their rule over Iran. Islamic
theologians, like their Christian equi¬
valents, had condemned the practice
of dissecting corpses, and so made
difficult the serious study of anatomy.
In the 9th century, it is true,
Yuhanna ibn Masawayh had kept mon¬
keys for the purpose of dissection.
But systematic study only became pos¬
sible under the relative freedom of
Mongol rule. The result was the 1396
Illustrated Anatomy of Mansur bin
Faqih llysás. Its illustrations (also
abhorrent to the theologically strict)
were another result of Mongol tole¬
rance.
After the Mongol invasion, the study
of mathematics and astrology continu¬
ed to flourish, as shown by the con¬
struction of observatories at Maragheh
and Samarkand.
Limits of space have restricted this
discussion to peaks, at the expense of
the lesser heights and valleys without
which no mountain range exists. Not
only have such branches of science
as optics been passed over but impor¬
tant names have been omitted. Nor
has the question whether some of the
scientists were wholly Iranian been
discussed.
This suggests indeed a final tribute.
To these Iranian physicians, chemists
and astronomers the question of their
national origin would have seemed
irrelevant in a discussion of their work.
Ignorant of racism, though aware of
their particularity, they stood as con¬
scious heirs of Greek and Hindu fore¬
runners. They saw their contributions
as part of an interwoven human endea- *
vour which had its source in God, 1 Jl
the origin of knowledge, and its
purpose as the service of his creation,
mankind.

### 53893: Sacred art in Persian culture
Sacred art in
by Seyyed Hossein Nasr
T
HROUGHOUT Persian his¬
tory an especially intimate relation has
always existed between art and the
spiritual discipline of the dominant
religion of the day. For this reason
it is sometimes difficult in Persian
culture to distinguish sacred art from
traditional art of which it forms a part.
However, the term "sacred art" can
be taken as being limited to those
traditional artistic expressions directly
connected with spiritual principles,
with religious and initiatory rites, with
sacred subjects and with symbolism of
a spiritual character.
Since sacred art Is the bridge bet¬
ween the material and the spiritual
worlds, it is inseparable from the par¬
ticular religion with which it is connect¬
ed. We can speak logically of Hindu,
Buddhist and Moslem sacred .art, but
not, for example, of Indian sacred art,
if by India we mean a land and a
people.
Certain forms and artistic symbols, it
is true, are sometimes borrowed from
one religion by another, but the spirit
behind them is transformed in the pro¬
cess. Both Islam and Byzantine Chris¬
tianity adopted Sassanid techniques of
dome construction, producing domed
buildings which, however, reflect two
different types of art.
Islamic art adopted many art motifs
of pre-lslamic Persia as well as of
central Asia, but they became trans¬
formed by the spirit of Islam and
served as building blocks in structures
whose design was completely Islamic.

the art of the pre-lslamic period in

### 53893: Sacred art in Persian culture
Persian culture
The sacred art of Persia attains a pinnacle of
expression in the Royal Mosque at Isfahan, once
the capital of Persia. Its palaces, mosques,
squares and gardens rose as if by magic in less
than 18 years during the reign of Shah Abbas I
(1587-1629). Here the rich elegance of the
architectural forms has been captured by the
photographer at a propitious moment of the day
when the play of light and shadow accentuates
every line and form.
Persia are either religious or royal In
character. And since the monarchy
was quasi-religious in nature, the
royal art was in turn closely identified
with the Zoroastrlan view of the world.
An American specialist on Iranian
art, A.U. Pope, has suggested that
Persepolis was constructed as a palace
for religious ceremonies as much as
for the purposes of political rule, the
architectural forms and the layout of
the gardens being a form of mándala
[a graphic mystic symbol of the uni¬
verse] closing upon an inner centre
and serving as a "reminder" of para¬
dise. The word paradise itself, as well
as the word firdaws in Arabic, derives
from the Avestan pairi-daeza meaning
garden.
In pre-lslamic Persia, we can include
under Zoroastrian forms of sacred art
the architecture of the fire-temples,
the music and poetry that accompanied
Zoroastrian rites, and the sacerdotal
dress of which some ¡mages have
remained.
Also certainly of traditional charac¬
ter and associated with royal initiation
and the "lesser mysteries" are the
heraldic symbols found in many differ¬
ent forms and shapes and resem¬
bling in character and significance the
heraldic art of other oriental civiliza¬
tions and the medieval West.
Like its successor Islam, Zoroastri-
anism possessed none of the religious
idols found in other Indo-European
religions or the religion of ancient
Greece. Hence there is no sacred art
in the form of sculpture to be found
in Zoroastrian Persia. To find sacred
¡mages in the form of statues we have
to go back to the pre-Zoroastrian reli¬
gions of Iran.
Even Mithraism, which arose from
a Zoroastrian background and left
many statues outside Persia, did not
leave any statues In Persia itself. The
image of Ahura-Mazda, represented
by two wings, is the closest we can
get to a sacred image in Zoroastri-
anism. But even these images were
carved on large pieces of stone or
on the sides of mountains; separate
statues were not made of them.
The Zoroastrian angels, which would
correspond to the divinities or gods of
other Indo-European religions, were

The mosques of Isfahan are world-famous for their gracefulness and the extraordinary
interplay of geometric design, calligraphic form, architectural line and light and shadow.

spiritualized entities whose represen¬
tation in concrete forms and images
corresponded much more closely to
the Christian icons of Christ and the
Virgin Mary than to the statues of
divinities in ancient religions.
During the Islamic period the con¬
nexion between art and religion has
become even more firmly established.
The craft guilds created early on
in Islamic cities were closely connect¬
ed with Sufism, the name by which
Islamic mysticism came to be known
from the 8th or 9th century A.D. on¬
wards, This link still survives in cer¬
tain places and the masters of the
guilds become initiated into the mys¬
teries of Sufism, learning the meta¬
physical and cosmological doctrines
which underlie the symbolism of
Islamic art.

to galleries and museums there was no
such artificial concept as the "fine
arts". The daily utensils of ancient

	 "».-
civilizations, which for us today are
objets d'art to be preserved in
museums, are evidence of the organic
link that existed between art and life.
In Persian culture the very words
used for art fann, hunar, and some¬
times san'at reveal its universality
and its bond with all aspects of life.
A Persian says that everything has its
fann, that is, the correct manner of
doing it; or that to do a particular act
needs hunar, that is, requires a parti¬
cular skill or art. San'at, which now¬
adays is also used to mean tech¬
nology, refers to the crafts which are
identical with the plastic arts.
It is wrong to speak of arts "and"
crafts; the two are one and the same
thing. To make a beautiful plate or
pot is as much art as to paint a minia¬
ture. This unity is particularly evident
among the traditional Persians be¬
cause they are one of the most crea¬
tive and artistic of peoples, the deli¬
cacy of their artistic taste running
through every aspect of traditional
Persian life, from architecture and
gardening to cooking and even to
smoking the water pipe.
In Persian culture, during the Islamic
period, the Hermetic sciences and
particularly alchemy played an inter¬
mediary role between the purely meta¬
physical' and cosmological doctrines
of Islam and the making of things.
To the Islamic mind, the aim of art is
to ennoble matter. Similarly, alchemy
is a symbolic science of material
objects which demonstrates the con¬
nexion between minerals and metals
and the spiritual and psychic worlds.
Basically, alchemy is a science of
the transformation of the soul based
on the symbolism of the mineral king¬
dom, rather than, as many have sup¬
posed, a form of pre-chemistry. For
this reason it is concerned with the
ennobling of matter, with the trans¬
mutation of base metal into gold.
The relation between alchemy and
art in Persia, as in Islamic art in gen¬
eral, has been profound. The colours
used in many works of art, far from
being dependent merely upon artistic
whim, are related to their alchemical
symbolism.
Through alchemy and similar cosmo¬
logical sciences, Islam created an
ambience that was Islamic in both
form and content, in which religious and
spiritual principles were embodied in
matter, in the world that surrounds
man in his everyday life, with a con¬
sequently deep influence upon his
whole attitude of mind.
The sacred art of Islam is related
in both form and spirit to the Divine
Word as revealed in the Koran. The
Word having been revealed as a book,
rather than as a human being as in
Christianity, sacred art Is concerned
with the letters and the-sounds of the
Holy Book.
Islamic sacred art is above all
expressed in mosque architecture and

SACRED ART (Continued)
20
calligraphy which are inextricably relat¬
ed to the meaning and form of the
Koran and may be said to "flow" from
It.
The space created inside a mosque,
far from being arbitrary and acciden¬
tal, Is deliberately planned to remove
those blocks and tensions that might
prevent the Word from spreading in
a limitless and harmonious space, a
space filled with peace and equili¬
brium in which the Spirit is every¬
where and not localized in a particular
icon or statue.
Mosque architecture, therefore,
derives from the spirit of the Koran,
regardless of the fact that certain
building techniques were borrowed
from Sassanid, Byzantine and other
sources. The outer shapes of
mosques reflect symbolically the
different Divine Names and Qualities
(asmâ' wa sifât), the dome correspond¬
ing to the Divine Beauty (Jamal) and
minarets to the Divine Majesty (¡alai).
Many varied architectural styles
were developed according to the
ethnic genius of the people involved,
but a profound relationship exists
between these styles; such widely
separated buildings as the mosque of
Cordova, the Jâmi' mosque of Isfahan
and the Delhi mosque are united
within a single spiritual universe.
Calligraphy is similarly very closely
related to the Koran in, its forms and
symbolism. In Islamic art calligraphy
has made possible a powerful decor¬
ative art form which also represents a
spiritual style. In the typical tiled
mosque architecture of Persia the two
basic forms of sacred art, architecture
and calligraphy, are reunited.
A remarkable feature of Islamic
architecture, almost unique In the his¬
tory of art, is that, early on, it reached
a peak at which it has remained to
our own day. Despite certain varia¬
tions a permanence and continuity link
the Damghan mosque, in north-east
Iran, with traditional contemporary
mosques.
The traditional Persian home is a
kind of extension of the mosque in
the sense that it perpetuates its purity
and simplicity. The ritual cleanliness
of the carpets on which one can pray
and on which one goes barefoot, the
"emptiness" of the traditional furni-
tureless rooms, and other elements,
relate house to mosque in spirit.
The minor arts too have their impor¬
tance because they put the "seal of
the sacred" upon even the most com¬
mon of everyday objects that surround
man in his daily life. Rugs are a recap¬
itulation of paradise, enclosed in a
frame and looking inward towards the
centre like the courtyard and the Per¬
sian garden.
Miniatures, so closely linked with
book illustrations, are an extension of
calligraphy and again recall the states
of paradise. Even traditional dress
in all its forms Is designed to facilitate
the performance of Islamic rites.
The spiritual force behind the poetry
and music of all Islamic peoples is the
chanting and recitation of the Koran,
an audible form of sacred art par excel¬
lence. The Persian language as we
know it today was a creation of the
early Islamic, period and thus was
more affected, especially in its poetry,
by the spirit and form of the Koran
than even Arabic whose poetic tradi¬
tion was already formed at the time
of the Koranic revelation.
Coupled with the poetic genius of
the Persians, this fact explains the
extraordinary richness of religious and
mystical poetry in the Persian lang¬
uage. Though not sacred art in the
direct sense, Persian poetry, espe¬
cially Persian Sufi poetry, is intimately
connected with the Koran. If Arabic
is the language of the Word the lang¬
uage of God as He spoke through
Gabriel to the Prophet of Islam then
It could be said that Persian is the
language of the angels, the language
of. paradise. The rhythm and rhyme
of Persian poetry reflect the echo of
the Koran in the minds of the men
who created this poetry.
Persian music finds its origins in the
music of the ancient Aryan peoples and
is akin to the Greek music of Pythag¬
oras' day. The banning of the social
side of music during the Islamic period
meant that it turned inwards to be¬
come a contemplative art. In its
purely musical content, as well as in
relation to Sufi poetry with which it
has always been intimately linked,
Persian music is a powerful aid to the
achievement of the contemplative
states of Sufism. It is no accident
that, over the centuries, most Persian
musicians have been associated with
Sufism.
The Persian- art form that comes
nearest to the liturgical and sacred
theatre of other traditions is the ta'
ziyah or passion play, peculiar to the
Shi'ite school. Usually these plays
depict scenes and events of the tra¬
gedy of Karbela [the martyrdom of
Husain, son of Fatimah, the daughter
of Mohammed] although other themes
have been treated.
An essential characteristic of the
ta'ziyah is that the audience is as
much a part of the play as the actors,
and both participate with all their body
and soul in the events of sacred
history recounted on the stage.
The same holds true of the sarna,
the spiritual concert of the Sufis. To
be simply a spectator without the
spiritual preparation at a session of
samâ would alter the whole nature
and meaning of the performance.
Persian art in general and sacred art
in particular have left a heritage of
incredible richness. With their great
artistic talent and taste the Persians
have succeeded In creating an art that
is both, spiritual and sensuous, that
reveals the beauty of this world as
well as its fleeting nature. This heri¬
tage is still a living reality for the vast
majority of Perèians and is of inestim¬
able value for the whole world.

air, cooled underground, into the buildings as
relief from the intense heat of summer.

### 53898: The Romance of Varghe and Golshah
THE ROMANCE
OF VARGHE
AND GOLSHAH
by A.S. Melikian-Chirvani
T
Article © Copyright Reproduction prohibited
EN years ago, a 13th cen¬
tury Persian manuscript, the only sur¬
viving copy of a romance written short¬
ly after 1000 A.D., was discovered in
the store rooms of the Topkapi Saray
Museum in Istanbul.
The 71 miniatures of great beauty
that accompany the text constitute the
only known complete set of illustra¬
tions to a Persian romance painted
before the 14th century.
The discovery was clearly of great
significance to art historians and to
specialists in Persian literature. But
more than this, the manuscript of
Varghe va Golshah such is the name
of this love story written by one Ayyu-
ghi of whom nothing more is known
provides a unique specimen through
the pages of which a profound analy¬
sis of the very nature of Iranian art can
be made.
From earliest times, Iranian art, and
for that matter Oriental art In general,
has reflected attitudes to the world
that are sharply opposed to Western
concepts. In handling figurative
themes, the Eastern painter or sculptor
eliminates anything that might situate
his work in time or space.
The king subduing a lion, on the
golden plaques found at Zivle, and the
procession of winged bulls, on the
sides of the golden beakers from the
ASSADULLAH SOUREN MELIKIAN-CHIRVANI
is a member of the National Centre for
Scientific Research, and the Centre for
Higher and Islamic Comparative Studies, in
Paris. An art historian of Iranian origin
specializing In the Middle East, and
a noted art critic, he is the author
of an essay on the relationship be¬
tween literary and plastic aesthetics in
Iran, based on his studies of the illuminated
manuscript. "Varghe and Golshah", which
he also translated Into French. He has
published many articles in specialized journ¬
als on Iranian and Arab metalwork and is
currently preparing the catalogue raisonné
for an international exhibition on Iranian Art
in 1973 for the Museum of Decorative Arts
in Paris.
9th-8th century B.C. Marlik hoard, are
not representations of a specific story
or event. The postures are stylized
and the figures in bas-relief are
smoothly modelled and cast no shad¬
ows. There Is not the slightest sug¬
gestion of a landscape or even a
realistically drawn plant to remind us
of the world as we see it.
At Persepolis, two hundred years
later, Iranian sculptors followed much
the same rules. Built in the 6th and
5th centuries B.C., this palace repre¬
sents the ultimate stage of north¬
western Iranian art from Marlik and
other sites reproduced on a monumen¬
tal scale.
The winged bulls and lions, all iden¬
tical, never depart from the idealized
model that the sculptors had in mind.
Their skill in rendering subtle shades
of relief was unsurpassed, yet they
applied it not to realistic representa¬
tion, but to almost calligraphic styliza-
tion.
The muscles of the lions' thighs, in¬
stead of having that life-like quality so
strenously sought after by the Greek
sculptors of Pericles' day, are Inter¬
preted as idealized double curves.
There is no attempt to convey the idea
of the wind blowing through the dra¬
peries of the royal guards and ser¬
vants; they are reduced to abstract,
geometric patterns.
An almost imperceptible, motionless
smile curls the lips of the faces, seen
in profile, and the almond-shaped eyes
seem to be looking into some far-
distant "beyond". Not one wrinkle
stirs their brow, not one stray hair
disturbs the symmetry of their head¬
dress, not one distinctive feature
separates one face from another.
They are not individuals but arche¬
types from another world.
It would be hard to imagine a more
vivid contrast to trie principles of
Western art, as established in the
Greece of Pericles' day, which sought
out and stressed the individuality of
every man.
The art of the East produced arche¬
types, that of the West produced
portraits, and Greek art sought to
portray traits of psychological make¬
up and character. The quality of ana¬
tomical observation, the skill in render¬
ing depth and space, in creating the
optical illusion of perspective, in
bringing life to subject matter were its
criteria the exact opposite, in short,
of all that Eastern art was aiming at.
The conquest of Iran by Alexander,
the advent of a Greek dynasty and the
subsequent influx of Westerners might
have deflected Iran from her course
and converted her to the naturalistic
branch of art favoured by Europe.
This was not to be. Hellenistic art
did appear, presumably under the
Seleucid rulers, and still flourished in
early Parthian times, but it barely rose
above the level of third rate provincial
production. The adoption of these
Western principles of art ended in
total failure, as if attitudes so utterly
alien to the Oriental perception of the
world were an artificial graft which
failed to "take".
With the advent of the Sassanian
dynasty, in 224 A.D., Iran returned to
Oriental sources and principles for
good. The horsemen carved in relief
on the rocks of Fars or executed in
repoussé on silver bowls move in a
spaceless and timeless world. Many
more styles were to be evolved in
Iran, but throughout history the per¬
manent attitudes underlying all artis¬
tic creativity were to remain un¬
changed.
An art form such as this, which
strives to eliminate the Inessential
from every scene and the fortuitous »IT
individuality from every face so as to ¿.I
reduce the "apparent world" to arche¬
types and idealized models, must

VARGHE AND GOLSHAH (Continued)
necessarily be an art of signs and
symbols. It is an art of writing in three
dimensions, just as calligraphy Is In
two dimensions.
Little is left to us of Sassanian calli¬
graphy except for some rather special
lapidary Inscriptions. But we know
that from the earliest times, Iran was
to attach ever-Increasing importance
to that supreme form of abstraction.
There Is the pure calligraphy of 9th
and 10th century pottery from Susa in
the south-west to Neyshabur In Kho-
rassan. There are the monumental
Inscriptions woven, as It were, into the
very texture of 14th century mosques
and mausoleums by laying the bricks
to given patterns.
The divine name of Allah is to be
seen in alternately orientated direc¬
tions as if the architect had set out to
translate into his brick Idiom the ver¬
tiginous mysticism of the Sufi calling
out the ninety-nine names of God.
Nowhere else in the world and at no
other time has the call to the divinity
been so wedded to the very structure
of a building.
If we turn to literature, we find that
these attitudes, so striking in plastic
art, are directly paralleled in Its writ¬
ten forms. Both express the same
perception of the world.
The great importance of the Varghe
va Golshah is that It provides us with
the earliest surviving work in which we
can perceive the full measure of this
parallelism. It shows clearly that Per¬
sian literature Is a literature of themes,
just as Persian art is an art of stereo¬
type images.
The author of Varghe va Golshah
tells us that he borrowed his story
from "the books of the Arabs". In
fact, a brief analysis shows that he
has woven Into his book themes taken
from the Iranian repertoire. The same
themes also occur in the second
earliest Persian romance, Vis u Ramin,
written by Gorgani about the middle
of the 11th century.
The two stories both tell of young
children brought up together who fall
in love. In both cases, the girl is
given in a marriage of convenience to
a prince she does not love, but she
manages to avoid the nuptial act. Gor¬
gani relates the same story of the
king to whom she was denied and who
takes her by force, just as in Ayyu-
ghi's romance, and of the young lover
who sets out in search of his beloved
and reaches the castle in which she is
Imprisoned.
The analogies between the two
stories extend to the secondary
characters the confidante, the two
mysterious riders who cross the
lovers' path and the magician met by
chance. This is all the more remark¬
able as the two works could be
expected to be entirely different.
Gorgani says that he translated his
work from a Pahlavi original, not from
an Arab romance, and the society he
describes Is that of feudal Iran in pre-
lslamic times. Ayyughi purports to
depict bedouin nomads roaming the
deserts of Arabia in the times of the
prophet Mohammed. Yet the similar¬
ities between many of the central
themes bear witness to the compelling
attraction of a traditional repertoire.
Indeed, invention and innovation are
not the primary aim of the sculptor,
the painter or the writer. Their atti¬
tude is rather the reverse; they take
up themes that have been handled by
others before them and fit them Into
a pattern that pleases them.
This attitude is closely related to
other fundamental attitudes that can be
only briefly mentioned that of the dis¬
ciple striving to follow his spiritual
guide's teaching in order to master it
fully before pursuing his own medita¬
tion; that of the poet for whom art Is
above all a form of knowledge, or
rather a way of transmitting know¬
ledge.
Spiritual enlightenment is not a
story that is invented; it is a discipline
into which one is initiated, a model
to be followed, a language to be
mastered.
These are the concepts underlying
all forms of creativity In Iran. And this
is why strict parallels can be found
between the rules of literary and plas¬
tic composition. The story of Varghe
va Golshah is the most ancient work
in which this analogy is apparent.
A comparison between the illustra¬
tions and the episodes they depict
reveals that the painter's first concern
was to take up existing motifs and then
adapt them to the story.
The pretext for the image may be
very slight and on occasion the painter
Is in contradiction with the author. He
shows us two men fighting where the
author tells of two armies engaged
in pitched battle. He opens his cycle
of illustrations with an arcaded
bazaar typical of a medieval town,
which in turn is symbolized by four
professional men, whereas the author
speaks of Bedouins camping in the
desert.
These discrepancies reveal the
existence of an ancient and powerful
pictorial tradition which in part ante¬
dates the literary tradition to which it
is allied in these tales.
Even more than the choice of
recurring themes, the way in which
both writer and artist treat them
reveals the basic similarity of their
artistic approach. The author never
attempts to characterize an episode
by specific detail. His descriptions of
events invariably follow set patterns
much as the painter's ¡mages follow
set schemes. The psychology of the
individual does not concern him any
more than the rendering of individual¬
ized features does the painter. He is
interested in fundamental, almost
conceptual attitudes.
We are told that the two adolescents
are in love, that armies fight, but no
background details are supplied. Liter-

ziir
ary description reveals a stylization
of thought that matches plastic styliza¬
tion to a nicety.
Two lovers talking to each other
speak in turn, according to a regular
rhythm, using the same words and
ideas, much as the miniatures show
them leaning symmetrically towards
each other in identical garb. Ref¬
erences to nature are expressed in
metaphors as abstract, as remote from
individual experience as the painter's
mythical, symmetric plants, standing
out against a monochrome or scroll-
covered background.
One of the strangest aspects of this
stylized perception is revealed in the
use of certain numbers. Quantities
are never selected haphazardly and
are limited by the author to the figures:
2, 3, 4, 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 100 and
1,000; to which should be added: 6, 7,
12, 14, 16, 32, 36, 48, 72 and a few
others to be found in other works.
The same quantities, oddly enough,
appear to have been used by painters;
a house has twelve or thirty crenellat¬
ed battlements; a plant has twelve
leaves. In the first illustration, in
which the painter depicts the baker
in his shop, an irresistible instinct
compels him to portray 14 loaves
hanging from the ceiling. We must,
however, beware of reading a sym¬
bolic meaning into these numbers any
more than in the fact that Varghe
encountered 40 thieves along his way.
It is simply an extreme form of styli
zation which It would not be an
exaggeration to term the aesthetics
of numbers.
Just as events follow idealized
patterns, so do faces correspond to
an archetype described at length by
Ayyughi and other Persian poets.
This is a face rounded like the full
moon, pink as a rose, with a tiny,
cornelian mouth, arched eyebrows,
almond-shaped eyes and with two pig¬
tails framing it. A face of pure beauty,
it is to be seen among the ruins of
the llth century palace at Ghazni and
in eastern Iranian Buddhist art. The
face is both male and female, although
occasionally the poets spoke of the
downy beard of a young man or the
full white beard of an elder.
An art such as this could only
evolve slowly through gradual modi¬
fication of the rules of art and not
as the result of the inventiveness of
individual artists. Historically speaking
it was rich .and diversified, but
because it followed a canon, it is diffi¬
cult to identify its authors when the
colophons or the signatures are lost.
In fact, this is of very little impor¬
tance since the criteria by which we
judge Iranian or Oriental art are not
those we use for assessing the art
of the West. Indeed, they are dia¬
metrically opposed. In Europe the
artist is admired for his inventive
ability, in Iran he is praised for having
equalled or even surpassed his
master, but always with reference to
the model. The West admires a feel¬
ing of real life instilled into beings and
nature and the artist's ability to
capture visual impressions, even if
only impressions of light.
Iran glorifies the perfection of a
calligraphic stroke, the penmanship,
the order and rhythm of structure.
To create a physical impression of
relief, light and shade, to suggest
a personal feeling in painting or poetry
is meaningless, . almost absurd, In a
world aiming for the Absolute and
therefore devoted to abstraction in
the real sense.
Significantly, Iran was to turn to
Individualistic portrayals only on the
eve of decadence, when her culture,
its content drained of life, was under¬
going a process of westernization.
And what was true of Iran was valid
for the whole of the Eastern world.
The story is told of a Jesuit painter
who had been commissioned to pro¬
duce a portrait of the Emperor Chien-
Lung. At last came the day when
the portrait was unveiled before the
Emperor. For a time he remained
absorbed in silence. At long last he
asked: "What do those black strokes
on the cheek signify?" "Sire, they
are shadow", the Reverend Father
explained. "There is no shadow on
the Emperor's face", came the reply.
Nor was any shadow ever to be seen
on the full moon faces of traditional
Iranian art.

CYRUS'S CYLINDER. Few rulers in ancient history have earned the renown and respect accorded to Cyrus the
Great, founder, 2,500 years ago, of the Persian Empire. One of the important sources for the history of Cyrus is
the cuneiform writing on the Cylinder of Cyrus (right) discovered during excavations at Babylon which Cyrus entered
in 539 B.C. In this written message to the Babylonians, dated 538-529 B.C., Cyrus declared: "I (am) Cyrus, the
king of the world, the king of Babylon, the king of Shumer and Akkad, the king of the four regions . . . When I
entered Tintar [ancient name of Babylon] peacefully ... I established my sovereignty in the palace of the princes.
Marduk [the Babylonian national god] inclined the noble hearts of the people of Babylon towards me, for I was
daily attentive to his worship . . ." Cyrus did in fact scrupulously respect the Babylonian religions and repaired the
temples. In 539 B.C. he authorized the return to Palestine of the Jews deported by Nebuchadrezzar and arranged
for the rebuilding of the Hebrew temple in Jerusalem.

The stone
tablets of
Cyrus and Darius
The ruins of ancient Susa, admi¬
nistrative capital of Darius I and
his successors, probed and un¬
covered by archaeologists since
1884, have yielded a rich harvest
of historical remains and arte¬
facts. But last year the Palace
ofDarius had yet another surprise
in store for the archaeologist.
A French mission, in collaboration
with Iran's Service for the Pro¬
tection of Historic Monuments,
was excavating the foundations
of the palace walls, a preliminary
to their partial restoration, when
they came across two stone
tablets inscribed with cuneiform
characters. As they soon realized,
they had discovered the stones
inscribed with the charter of the
foundation of the pa/ace of Da¬
rius, placed beneath the walls at
the end of the 6th century B.C.
The tablets of grey marble, in a
perfect state of preservation,
were engraved on their six sides.
The one placed under the east
wall of a corridor bore a text in
Akkadian an ancient language of
Mesopotamia, used in cuneiform
writing from about the 28th to
the 1st century B.C. (photo right).
The second, recovered from be¬
neath the west wall, was inscrib¬
ed in Elamite (the language of
Elam, an ancient country to the
east of Babylon). It is probable
that a third tablet with an inscrip¬
tion in ancient Persian the
third official language of the
Empire was also placed in the
foundations.
Not only has the discovery
brought to light a new text
dating from the Achaemenid
epoch with, in the Elamite text,
a dozen new words to add to the
lexicon of this language. It has
also given to a millimetre the
length of the royal cubit under
Darius (33.60 cm.), and has con¬
firmed beyond all doubt that the
section of the pa/ace where the
finds were made was the work
of Darius.

by Joseph Santa-Croce
HE Shah-nama or the Book
of Kings, written towards the end of
the 10th century by the Persian poet
Ferdowsi (or Firdausi), is a work of
vast literary wealth and of exceptional
moral value. It is indeed an achieve¬
ment on the grand scale, not only In
its sheer length (some fifty thousand
couplets) but also in Its scope,
relating as it does the exploits of the
kings who founded Iran.
It soon becomes clear, however,
that the Shah-nama is more than just
an epic tale; it contains full-scale
courtly romances as well as a political
and moral message. Yet this astonish¬
ing diversity in no way detracts from
the literary excellence of the work.
The author is a poet to his fingertips
and a master of a pure and simple
style.
Not the least surprising feature of
the Shah-nama is that, though It was
JOSEPH SANTA-CROCE was lecturer at
the Faculty of Letters of Teheran University
from 1965 to 1969, and is the author of
many studies on present-day Iran. He is
now on the staff of the International Lycée

### 53899: The Epic of the kings: Persia's national saga, the 'Shah-nama'
written in about 995 A.D., it remains
clearly intelligible to the average
Iranian of today. Quite apart from the
continuing success it enjoys in Iran,
its significance for our present day
world is strikingly apparent to anyone
who cares to study it; in short, it is
an extraordinarily topical work.
As the French oriental scholar Henri
Massé has pointed out, the period of
Persian history covered in the Book
of Kings stretches over four dynasties
of pre-lslamic kings: the king-judges
(the Pichdadians), the Kaianid dynasty
(a word derived from the old Persian
"Kavi" meaning king), the Arsacids
(otherwise known as the Ashkanians)
and the Sassanian Shahs.
Henri Massé adds that "the first
two dynasties are almost wholly legen¬
dary, while the third is limited to but
a few names. These dynasties are
sub-divided into fifty reigns of varying
duration which do not, to be sure,
correspond to the historical dates".
Massé asserts that divisions within
this sprawling epic should be based
"not oh the reigns of individual kings,
but on the episodes, the minor epics,
which combine to form the whole".
In this brief study it would be neither
feasible nor desirable to mention all
these episodes. Only the most impor¬
tant and the most famous of them,
therefore, will be highlighted with now
and then a glance at some other, more
arbitrarily selected, episodes which
seem worthy of comment.
Let us call the roll of names which,
in the first books, awaken in the
Iranian nation memories of their early
moments of trial and glory: King Jam-
shid and the monster Zahhak; the
doughty deeds and just judgements of
King Faridun and King Manuchehr; the
strange fate of Zal, whose foster father
was the fabulous bird Simorgh (his
real father having abandoned him at
birth because he could not accept a
new-born babe with a head of white
hair); the advent of Rostam, an Iranian
Hercules and Achilles rolled into one,
as renowned for his magnanimity as
for his sudden rages; Slyavosh who,
unjustly accused by Sudaba, was to
meet the same fate as Euripides'
Hlppolytus; Alexander the Great who,
at his own desire, became Iranian,
adopting the name Sekander; the reign
of Nushirvan and the famous ministry
of Bozorgmehr; the reign of Khosrow
Parviz, and, finally, the calamitous
reign of Yazdergerd which led to the
fall of the Sassanian Shahs and a long
foreign occupation.
Interspersed with the heroic epi¬
sodes are delightful tales of courtly
love (Zal and Rudaba, Bizhan and
Manizha, Khosrow and Shirin) as well
as passages evoking Zoroaster's aus¬
tere doctrine and recalling readers to
the similarly monotheistic Moslem
faith.
One of the more paradoxical aspects
of Ferdowsi's style is that it recon¬
ciles and makes play with the vigour

stands nearly 8 metres (26 ft.) high. Though damaged by a fall of rock,
probably caused by an earthquake, this 3rd century A.D. sculpture still
offers a majestic portrait of one of the most renowned Sassanian kings. A
great builder and founder of cities, Shapur created Jundi-Shapur, near
modern Ahwaz in south Persia. There he set up a hospital and medical
school that became a famous 6th century university where Persian, Greek
and Indian doctors met to elaborate medical laws and to discuss their
work. Ferdowsi's "Book of Kings" describes Shapur as "guardian
of the world and husbander of the wealth of great and humble alike."

Boars, stags, elephants, horses, camels, hunters, musicians, boatmen
a host of human and animal figures' surges along the walls of the
famous grotto at Taq-i Bostan in eastern Iran, forming one of the most
majestic spectacles of rock-cut sculpture ever created by Iranian
artists. These hunting scenes, imbued with vigour and vitality,
were carved by Sassanian sculptors in a great grotto set in a sheer
cliff face near Kermanshah, a town on the ancient Silk Road of Asia.
On these and the following pages we present, almost in their entirety,
the two hunting scenes cut in relief on the side walls of the grotto
towards the end of the 5th century A.D. Below, the royal boar hunt.
In the centre, standing in a boat, a Sassanian monarch, possibly King
Khosroes II, lets fly an arrow at his quarry. Carcasses of the boars
are shown loaded on the backs of elephants (left and lower left).
Right, the royal stag hunt carved on the opposite side of the grotto.
In this monumental work, the sculptor has depicted (top to bottom)
the three phases of the hunt. Top centre, seated on his horse beneath
a parasol, the king awaits the signal for the start of the chase. Musi¬
cians seated on a nearby dais play for him. Below, the king gallops
in pursuit of the stags. Bottom, as the hunt ends, the king, quiver in
hand, slows his horse to a trot.

Iran's 5th century artists were highly skilled sculptors of animal forms.
Their feeling for the material they worked in and their ability to
imbue every feature of their carvings with movement and narrative qualities
is revealed in these details from the royal boar hunt (see also photo page 34).

Another detail from the relief depicting the stag hunt. A puzzling aspect of this scene is the
group of four figures that appear to be lying down in front of a line of realistically depicted
advancing elephants. Viewed horizontally the figures are seen to be marching men. The significance

THE EPIC OF THE KINGS (Continued from page 33)
of the art of an earlier age and the
more studied refinements of a civiliza¬
tion that has already reached its peak.
After noting the frequent recurrence
of two themes, "the lament for the
fallen kings and heroes and the des¬
cription of sunrise", Reuben Levy, to
whom we owe a translation of the
Shah-nama (1), rightly points out that
"tKe full range of poetic arts are
brought into play so that no two sun¬
rises are described in the same terms
or in the same manner and no two
laments are identical".
Ferdowsi also excels in his des¬
criptions of the settings of these epi¬
sodes, for example, the rock on which
Simorgh's nest was "built so high that
its topmost level touched the skies,
for no toiling hand had built it, nor
was it made of stones and earth". It
is in this grandiose setting that Zal,
abandoned by his father, becomes
Simorgh's foster child, being suckled
not on milk but on the blood of the
fabled bird.
Ferdowsi is incomparable in his
evocations of battles; at times he
paints the scene in vivid colours, as
in the capture of Salm's fortress:
"...Twelve thousand men were killed
and a pall of smoke hung heavy over
the flames. The waves of the sea
were black as pitch and the desert
was a river of blood."
At times he conjures up the sounds
of battle, combining them with visual
impressions to create the effect of a
Delacroix painting set to the music of
Wagner: "... Such was the pounding of
horses hooves and the dust raised by
the armies that both the sun and
the moon were eclipsed. The mist
resounded to the clash of drums and
the swords were sated with red
blood... battleaxes pounded on golden
shields and helmets till the heads
beneath them reeled."
Ferdowsi's pictorial genius is as
universal and as wide-ranging as that
of a Rembrandt. He can turn from
awe-inspiring scenes of war to portray
with equal mastery the subtle tones
of the countryside in all the seasons,
and particularly in autumn.
Thus, for example, he puts these
words Into the mouth of King Bahram
Gur, so often represented in Persian
miniatures: "Now bring forth flowers,
pomegranates, apples and quinces and
let the golden beakers be never empty
of wine. When I shall see the apple's
cheek blush the colour of pome¬
granate, when the sky is spotted with
clouds like a leopard's coat, when the
camomile is fragrant and heavy with
seed, when the wine is red as the cup
bearer's cheek, when the air is mild,
neither hot nor cold, the earth cool
and the waters blue, when we have
donned our autumn robes of fur, then
must we go hunting by way of Djez."

(1) Reuben Levy, who died In 1966, was
professor of Persian at Cambridge University.
His translation has appeared In the Persian
Heritage Series of the Unesco Collection of
Representative Works under the title "The
Epic of the Kings" (Routledge and Kegan
Paul, London, and Chicago University Press,
1967).
I N the Book of Kings,
Ferdowsi does not limit himself to
descriptions of battles and the seasons;
he also touches upon the great moral
truths which he expresses with the
same studied perfection as the epic or
romantic episodes.
The Iranian tradition passed on by
Ferdowsi affirms its divine origin, lead¬
ing ever back towards God. Its mes¬
sage is the need to establish justice
and spread civilization throughout a
country freed from foreign domination.
For Ferdowsi, with his Iranian out¬
look, the monarchy was the perfect
instrument and vehicle of this tradition.
The Book of Kings, we sense, is not
only an Iranian Iliad and Odyssey and
the setting for the knightly romances
of the first empire to be built on a
truly world-wide scale (indeed, the first
genuinely "modern" state in history);
it also contains a treasury of wisdom
and moral guidance, as well as a store
of political precepts.
Intelligence, courage, strength and
justice are not seen by Ferdowsi as
being in opposition to each other, by
reason of some "principle" of the
separation of the virtues, but as being
linked together in the living person of
the King of Iran. Indeed, the Shah-
nama Is expressly conceived for the
furtherance of royal education. Fer¬
dowsi himself writes: "When you have
written this book of kings, give it to
the kings."
Young Iranians are taught at an
early age a fine precept from the Epic,
quoted by the poet Saadi in his Bustan:
"Canst thou reconcile the fact of hav¬
ing received life with the act of taking
the life of another? Harm not the ant
toiling with his grain of wheat; he too
has a life to live and even the ant's
life is sweet, to the ant."
Ferdowsi's tender feelings for King
Iraj can easily be sensed: "Since the
earth shall be our bed and a brick our
pillow, wherefore plant a tree today
whose roots will be watered with
blood, whose fruit will be vengeance
so long as It stands?" He shows that
Iraj's gentle nature is not without
wisdom and foresight. Later, the King
is murdered by his two jealous and
resentful brothers, but he is reveng¬
ed by his son who kills his two uncles
in single combat.
Though Ferdowsi frequently calls
into play the world of the fabulous,
he makes no claim to have pierced
the mysteries of life or indeed of the
hereafter. The wisdom he propounds
is imbued with an undeniable nobility
and dignity, nor can he be accused
of any lack of clarity or balance.
With aptly chosen metaphors the
poet gracefully illustrates the austere
ethic he wishes to impart: "Put not
thy trust in the favour of Fate; it is
not in the nature of a bow to be
straight. Heaven revolves above us,
now hiding from us the face she
revealed before; treat her as thy foe
and she smiles upon thee; call her
thy friend and she averts her face. A
word in thine ear, rid thy soul of love
of this world."
One of the great and terrible lessons
of the Book of Kings is its demons¬
tration of how, with the fall of the
Sassanians and the eclipse of Yazde-
gerd, the country's independence, lan¬
guage, civilization and well-being
crumble.
Yet Iran's destiny seems to be
closely linked with the Book of Kings.
With the passing of the centuries, as
we have seen, new dynasties arise,
restoring to the country her indepen¬
dence and language and enriching
civilization as a whole.
In my view it is neither rash nor
unrealistic to conclude that these
successive "renewals" drew inspira¬
tion and vigour from the epic work of
Firdowsi which highlights the great
regal figures of Iranian history.
O
NE of the book's opening
passages describes how Husheng,
one of the early kings: "built conduits
and canals to carry the water and by
his royal might soon brought this work
to completion." King Husheng himself
declares: "I have girt myself with
justice and righteousness according to
the command of God who ordaineth
victory." To this Ferdowsi adds: "From
that time on he set to civilizing the
world and to spreading justice to
every corner of the earth."
King Faridun's character resembles
that of the civilizing and justice-loving
Husheng. Like those he took as his
models and those who later were to
mould themselves on him, this king
of kings is a just king: "Whoever shall
maltreat a poor man, become arrogant
because of his riches or persecute the
wretched, him shall I deem an infidel
more wicked than Ahriman."
Today paintings of the heroes of the
Book of Kings Rostam, Siyavosh, lraj,
Bahram Gur the hunter adorn the
café walls in every town and village
of Iran. In the Zour Khaneh (gym¬
nasia), in which for centuries sport has
been considered as both a physical
and a moral discipline, Ferdowsi still
has a wide popular audience as the
athletes exercise to the rhythm of his
poems chanted by their instructors.
That Ferdowsi speaks to an ever¬
growing audience can only be a matter
of satisfaction. This legacy of moral nn
grandeur, undying wisdom and literary xU
brilliance constitutes an invaluable ****
offering to mankind from the Iranian
genius.

### 53901: The Thousand and one nights or the secret of Scheherazade
I
N this strange world,"
said Bernard Shaw, "you never can
telll" When a genie materializes from
a bottle and accuses someone of
killing his son... Well, that's what fairy
tales are made of. But when a young
girl named Scheherazade tells the
Sultan the story of a genie who
materialized from a bottle and accused
someone of killing his son..., that's no
longer a fairy tale, for if Schehera¬
zade falters in her story, or if the
Sultan so much as yawns, she will
lose her life.
No, you never can telll When
someone tells you that Scheherazade
saved her neck and halted a massacre
by telling the Sultan the story of a
genie who materialized from a bottle...
that's make believe! But when, about
the year 1700, Antoine Galland dis¬
covered that behind the seven Arabian
tales he was publishing there lay a
thousand and one nights of tales and
a Scheherazade to tell them, he
realized that this wasn't make believe
at all, and that he had just discovered
a new world. Can one ever really tell
how things will turn out?
Indeed one can'tl Galland, for ins¬
tance, thought he had reached the
Arab world, yet, without knowing it, he
had stumbled across Iran.
Even a great orientalist, then, could
be taken in by a remarkably well-
assimilated Arabic-speaking, Moslem
Scheherazade, decked out in Arab
garb. The names, Scheherazade and
Shahriyar, to be sure, were Iranian, but
perhaps they had been introduced just
to lend a touch of the exotic.
The language may not have been
the purest Arabic, yet it was indeed
Arabic, of that Galland was sure. Nor
was Islam pictured in very orthodox
terms: there were génies, fairies and
talismans what we would call "ma¬
gic", but what our grandmothers had
quite simply called "marvels".
Were A Thousand and One Nights,
in fact, Arab tales? Antoine Galland
himself might have been bewitched!
The sceptical orientalists who came
after him put Scheherazade to the
ordeal of a historical and textual inqui¬
sition. Name? First name? Parents'
date and place of birth? Like so many
police detectives they "grilled" the
ancient chroniclers.
Here, for example, is what Mas'udi,
a tenth century Arab historiographer,
wrote in a passage of his Golden
MICHEL LETURMY has made a speciality of
the great literature of the Orient. He Is the
author of an edition of the Arabian Nights
as Told to Children ("Les Mille et Une Nuits
Racontées aux Enfants", 1958) and of the
Club Français du Livre's Special Edition of
"Les Mille et Une Nuits" (The Thousand and
One Nights) with Notes and Introduction,
(1956). His "Dieux, Héros et Mythes" (Gods,
Heroes and Myths) deals with the mythologies
of different peoples and cultures, including
those of Iran. He is the co-author {with
Prof. M. Hamidullah) of a translation of the
Koran, republished this year, and (with
I. Grosjean) of a new translation of the Greek
New Testament (Bibliothèque de la Pléiade,
Ed. Gallimard, Paris, 1971.)
Prairies in which he cited the works
of fiction translated from Persian:
"The book, entitled in Persian Hezar
Efzaneh (A Thousand Tales) belongs
to this category of works; it Is better
known to the (Arab) public under the
name A Thousand and One Nights.
It is the story of a king and his vizier,
and of the vizier's daughter and a slave
who are called Shirazad and Dinazad."
Notice that Mas'udi wrote "entitled in
Persian."
At about the same time (10th
century), another Arab, Ibn al-Nadim,
was compiling a bibliography in which
he stated: "Mohammed ibn Abdus,
author of the Book of the Viziers, had
begun a collection of a thousand tales
borrowed from the Arabs, the Persians
and the Greeks. He sent for the
authors and took his pick of the best
they had to offer; at the same time, he
was taking extracts from books of
narratives and tales. In this way he
put together 480 nights, each one
containing a complete story of approxi¬
mately fifty pages. He died before he
could complete his thousand tales."
S
'TARTING with these state¬
ments, orientalists were able to trace
the history of A Thousand and One
Nights a little more closely. It is
thought that the Persian Thousand
Tales that Mas'udi mentions were
translated into Arabic during the 8th
century and were first entitled A
Thousand Nights. It is also believed
that some Arab tales were added in
the 9th century and that by the 16th
century the collection was in its defin¬
itive form, perhaps as a result of the
Mameluke conquest of Syria and the
conquest of Egypt by Selim I. This
might also explain why, finally, the
Thousand and One Nights settled
down in Cairo where they multiplied
and lived happily ever after.
There remained the task of making
a critical examination of the book to
find out whether it bore any traces
of its wanderings across boundaries
and through time. Basically four
groups of tales can be distinguished:
a group of Indian origin, a narrative
cycle connected with Baghdad, another
which came to be referred to as the
cycle of sea tales, and a final group
formed in Cairo.
In the Indian group the genie is king.
But the génies in these tales are
Moslem (faithful servants or harmful
spirits), who were mastered and
converted long after the tales about
them were first told. Metamorphoses
Into stones and beasts are common¬
place and animals speak. Yet though
these miraculous changes are wrought,
of course, in the name of Allah and
according to his will, one cannot help
but see in them watered down ver¬
sions of more ancient metempsy¬
choses.
In the tales of the second group the
fabulous gives way to the romantic;
they are tales of Intrigue, love or
manners. We walk the streets of
Baghdad, by day and by night, in the
company of the famous 9th century
Caliph Haroun al-Raschid; and if
magical ploys from India are introduc¬
ed, this is only done to help the plot
along.
The story of Sinbad the Sailor
clearly belongs in the sea cycle. His
Voyages have often been published
separately (Galland had translated
them before he discovered A Thousand
and One Nights.) But their character¬
istics can be found in many other tales.
"The wonder springs from an inex¬
tricable mixture of true and false. It is
the saga of the first navigators to use
the compass, the gnomon and the
astrolabe, the Odyssey of those who,
after reading Pliny and Strabo, finally
discovered the lamas of Tibet and the
white whales," writes Nadjim oud-Dine
Bammate in his study Themes and
Rhythms of A Thousand and One
Nights.
The Cairo group, with its mixture of
ancient and modern tales, is more
difficult to identify. At times the
fabulous seems to exceed all bounds;
at times It gives way completely to
satire and the picaresque. Thus, the
fabulous dominates the account of
Sinbad's seventh voyage, as revised
and corrected by the Egyptian story¬
teller.
Altogether, the investigation of the
text had got off to a bad start. It is
difficult to see how this investigation,
which talks of India, Iraq and Egypt
(having missed out Iran entirely) can
be reconciled with the testimony of
the old chroniclers who maintained
that A Thousand and One Nights came
to us from Iran.
But the wonder of A Thousand and
One Nights lies not so much in the
imaginativeness and the charm of the
tales, but In nature of the book itself
which was able to reunite and make
into a whole tales from so many dif¬
ferent sources. And Iran gave us the
story-teller, the young Scheherazade,
without whom none of this could have
existed.
Thus if we were to attempt may
Scheherazade pardon us to make an
orderly summary, we might say that
India and the Arab empire furnished
the material (fabulous myth and com¬
edy of manners), into which Islam
breathed the spirit.
But nothing would have been
created from these two elements had
not Iran embodied them in the only
literary form in which they could meet
and live. The spotlight falls on
Scheherazade, daughter of Iran, and
on her own story, into which could
be assimilated everything moving, sad,
funny, astonishing that the world had
to offer. The story of A Thousand and
One Nights is the story of Schehera¬
zade herself.

ago...

THE SECRET OF SCHEHERAZADE (Continued)
ALADDIN
AND THE
WONDERFUL
LAMP
Aladdin, Ali Baba and Sindbad the
Sailor are among the most popular
heroes of the tales in "The Thousand
and One Nights", tales which appeal
alike to children and grown-ups the
world over. Here, the famous puppets
of Sergei Obraztsov at the Moscow
Puppet Theatre enact two scenes
from Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp.
Above, from right, Aladdin, his fiancee,
his mother, the astrologer and the
sultan. Below, Princess Boudour. After
many adventures, Aladdin wins her
hand.
Upper Tartary, was invited to the
palace of his brother Shahriyar, king
of India and China. He had scarcely
left the city when he realized he had
forgotten one of the gifts he had
prepared for his brother. Returning
unexpectedly to the palace, he came
upon his wife asleep in the arms of
her lover. He killed them both and
returned to the caravan. But by the
time he reached his brother's palace,
he was wasted away by the grief that
tormented him. This continued until
one day he saw Shahriyar's wife giving
herself up to debauchery with her
maids and slaves.
The two brothers learned a lesson
from their misfortune and left the city,
determined to withdraw from the
world. But when they reached the
coast, they met a genie who made a
very beautiful young girl appear from
a glass casket. No sooner had the
genie fallen asleep than the girl grant¬
ed them her favours, adding their two
rings to the ninety-eight she had
received from other lovers. Shahriyar,
deciding that the genie was even
unhappier than he, returned to the
capital to take revenge, not only on
the queen, but also on all women.
He would marry a different one each
night and have her put to death the
next morning.
The decree was carried out and the
whole city mourned. But nothing, not
even so much bloodshed, could as¬
suage the Sultan's thirst for ven¬
geance. At this point Scheherazade,
the vizier's daughter, decided to put
an end to the massacre. So she said
to the vizier: "O my father, I have a
favour to ask of you." When the
vizier replied that he would grant any
reasonable request, Scheherazade
declared: "I have decided to put a
stop to the king's barbarity which
weighs so heavily upon the city. In
the name of Allah, arrange for my
marriage to him."
Aghast, the vizier replied: "Allah
be with you, have you lost your
senses-" "No", replied Scheherazade,
"for if I die, my death will be a ransom
for the others; if I succeed I shall have
performed a great service to my city.
You must grant me this boon".
Scheherazade also obtained the Sul¬
tan's permission to bring with her her
younger sister, Dinarzade, who at the
approach of dawn would say "O my
sister, if you are still awake, tell us
one of those delightful stories you
know, for this is perhaps the last time
that I shall be able to enjoy that
pleasure." This "last time" was to be
renewed night after night a thousand
and one times, thanks to the talent of
the story-teller and her cunning in
breaking off her narrative at the most
exciting moment.
On the thousand and first night, the
Sultan granted Scheherazade permis¬
sion to bring before him the three
male children she had borne him. One
was walking, one crawling, and the
third was still a babe in arms. Placing
them before the king she said, "O king
.of the century, here are your children.
I ask you to spare me because of
these little ones, for if you kill me
they will be motherless and no other
woman will be able to raise them."
Hearing these words the king wept.
Pressing the children to his breast
he said, "O Scheherazade, by Allah I
pardoned you even before the children
came, because I saw that you were
chaste and pure, intelligent and pious."
Thus Scheherazade emerged from
her duel with death not only alive but
triumphant. For though, for a thou¬
sand and one -nights, she is lost to
our sight behind the skilful smoke¬
screen of her narrative, we can never
forget that all the time she is but a
story's-length from death.
S
'INCE Shahriyar's day, mil¬
lions of men, anxious to know the
meaning of life, have been enchanted.
The story of Scheherazade was only
just beginning. Good-hearted, but not
overconcerned about acknowledging
her sources, she refused no invita¬
tions, inspiring the Mongol tales, A
Thousand and One Evenings, the
Peruvian A Thousand and One Hours,
the Tartar stories, A Thousand and
One Quarter Hours, and the Syrian
tales, Five Hundred and a Half Morn¬
ings.
She was patroness of many others,
even in France; A Thousand and One
Favours (1716), A Thousand and One
Platitudes (1742), A Thousand and One
Follies (1785). At about the same
time, in response to more pressing
invitations, she founded a whole col¬
lection, Le Cabinet des Fées, which
included Cazotte and Chavis' Evenings
of Sultan Shahriyar. Meanwhile Cré-
billon the younger wrote his Sopha in
which he claimed to depict the spine-
lessness of the "grandson of that
magnanimous Shahriyar".
To Godefroy Demombynes she
revealed a Berber version of A Thou¬
sand and One Nights and sent for a
certain dervish from Isfahan to relate
to Pétis le Croix the story of A Thou¬
sand and One Days.
Diderot found himself writing Les Bi¬
joux Indiscrets; Voltaire set his Zadig
"at the time when the Arabs and the
Persians were beginning to write A
Thousand and One Nights"; Montes¬
quieu played at being a Persian and
wrote his satirical Lettres Persanes;
Théophile Gautier arranged an "Orient
and Cairo", in Rue Le Peletier, where,
dressed as a Persian, he had the
Thousand and Second Night recited
to him.
But by now Scheherazade was not
to be satisfied with literature alone.
From Rimsky-Korsakov she got a
magnificent symphonic suite (1888)
and a composition for voice and
orchestra from Ravel (1903). With
Diaghilev's help she conquered the
Ballets Russe (1910); in May 1914 she
was seen at the Opéra Comique where
she presented Marouf, the Cobbler of

The tales of "The Thousand and One Nights", many of which came from 9th century Iran, are

these masterpieces of story-telling have been made in 40 countries. Choreographers and musicians
too have long been inspired by the enchanting tales. Above left, costume designed for the sul¬

the tale is not that Scheherazade held
her brutish husband in breathless sus¬
pense for a thousand and one nights,
nor that she managed to bend the
will of a powerful potentate. The
wonder is that we believe in it, and
the story-teller, far from seeming out
of place in our twentieth century,
western world, succeeds in jolting us
out of our epoch.
And therein lies part of her secret.
Scheherazade could never have come
down through the ages to us had she
not been borne along by the world she
revealed to us. And this world would
not have borne her along had she not
been the expression of its fullness and
its rhythm. Scheherazade was invin¬
cible because she reflected, above all,
a world in movement.
Here is how Nadjim-oud-Dine Barn-
mate describes this world in his
Themes and Rhythms of a Thousand
and One Nights. "It is a world in
which nothing is impossible, where
each one of our actions has incalcu¬
lable consequences, where objects
have their own indomitable, myste¬
rious life and are not in truth what they
appear to be.
"The fisherman uncorks a bottle, but
in so doing he frees a giant. The
cook thinks that she is frying fish,
but really she is summoning a fairy
who breaks through the kitchen wall,
magic bamboo wand in hand. The
world is without causality, or rather
it is subject to a series of trigger
mechanisms, of actions and reactions,
more profoundly secret than our
causality, and whose meaning escapes
us. The world is forever being turned
upside-down.
"In A Thousand and One Nights, the
capricious fantasy of events is balanc¬
ed by the consistency of human types.
The sultan, the sultana, the young
princes and princesses, viziers, mer¬
chants, judges, saints, harnais, procu¬
resses, fairies, shrewd merchants
knights, barbers, navigators, brigands,
astrologers, calligraphers and lovers
all speak and act as their rôles
demand.
T
HUS through the story¬
telling technique we begin to get an
idea of the landscape in which Sche¬
herazade moves, "a multi-faceted
character", writes Bammate, "faithful
to her legend, who finds herself
thrown into a whirlpool of unpredict¬
able events."
And this landscape is the panorama
of life itself (a life created out of
words). For if Scheherazade has the
power to summon génies and fairies
so that Camaralzaman can find the
princess Boudour, only to lose her
again, it is clear that there is no fixed
boundary between life and story.
Behind her back another story-teller
is pulling the puppet strings and
making up the tale that begins,
"Once upon a time a young maiden
named Scheherazade..."
Scheherazade was not born heroic;
she decided to become a heroine only
when this was the only choice open
to her. That was her style and her
secret. First of all, she knew how to
choose the right moment. Not too
early, not too late. It would have been
reckless to start too early; first Shah¬
riyar had to prove his inflexibility.
So Scheherazade counted the girls
who fell one a day and every day
calculated how many remained. She
still had some leeway before her turn
came after all, she was a vizier's
daughter. But she could not wait too
long until the knife was at her throat.
Instead she would go and confront
the sultan. But how? This was her
second stroke of genius; she realized
she no more had a choice of means
than she had of timing. Force was out
of the question; she had no desire to
die a martyr.
There remained one last way, the
very one for which Scheherazade felt
herself suited strategy. Attract the
enemy away from his familiar battle¬
field; draw the man into a woman's
world; astonish him before he has
time to recover and then immediately
rouse his curiosity in such a way that
he imagines he is still in command
(I won't execute her until she's finish¬
ed her story about the beggar).
Thus we learn from Scheherazade
that everything is a matter of strategy,
of humour and of language.
Is there anyone who has not sought,
despite the thousand pitfalls life
strews in his path, the lost treasure or
the enchanted city that each one of
us sets out to conquer? To find the
treasure, to lift the spell that hangs
over the city or over paradise, to risk
everything on the voyage and, if pos¬
sible, to remember the way back...
And if at times the legend lies quies¬
cent, word of it roams the world, from
Genesis and Gilgamesh to Le Grand
Meaulnes by way of The Holy Grail.
It wanders, more or less unsullied,
awakening in passing in those with
half an eye open, the deepest aspira¬
tions of mankind. Such is the mes¬
sage the Nights bring to us from
Iran.

FROM THE PEN OF HAFIZ. Above, the tomb of Hafiz, Iran's
most admired lyric poet, at Shiraz also his birthplace is a
centre of pilgrimage for the Iranian people. Shams ud Din
Mohammed, whose poetic name in Arabic, "Hafiz", means "One
who knows the Koran by heart", was born sometime between
1317 and 1326 A.D. He was often called by Iranians "The
Tongue of the Hidden" because of the sweetness and beauty
of his lyrics. The poetic form which Hafiz brought to perfection
was the ghazal, a work of 6 to 15 couplets linked by unity of
thought and symbolism rather than by a logical sequence of
ideas. The extraordinary popularity of his poetry in all Persian-
speaking lands is to be found in his simple and often colloquial
language, free from artificial virtuosity and his use of homely
images and proverbial expressions. His wide appeal in the
western world is shown by the fact that apart from several
complete translations of his works, numerous translations of
selections from his poems have been published (including 30 in
England alone). Perhaps to Persian taste the best, and in its
position the most apposite, of the poet's ghazals is that inscrib¬
ed on his tomb. Its reads, in part, "Beside my tomb with wine
and music seat yourself, /that sensing your fragrance I may rise
from within the grave. /Arise, O figure sweetly moving, let me
behold your stateliness, /that casting life and world aside I too
may rise."

### 53914: Ageless voices of poets & writers
AGELESS
VOICES
OF POETS
& WRITERS
Persia has a literary tradition reaching
back into the mists of early time. Yet
Persian literature, as the term is generally
understood, relates to works written in
modern Persian, the language that emerg¬
ed in the 9th century A.D. two centuries
after the Moslem invasion of Persia.
From then on, geographical, political and
religious forces influenced the develop¬
ment and trends of Persian literature over
the next centuries.
The earliest and most numerous examples
of literary Persian are in verse, possibly
because much of the early literature was
improvised and the elements of meter
and rhyme were aids to composition.
Prose developed later, from the back¬
ground of Arabic and pre-lslamic Persian
writings, and ranged from early transla¬
tions and narratives to books of counsel
for court residents and historical works
such as Juvaini's "History of the World
Conqueror", one of two notable works
produced during the Mongol period,
the other being Rashid al-Dini's "Com¬
pendium of Histories".
However, the writers whom Iranians hold
to be masters in the literary field are,
with few exceptions, not historians or
other authors of prose, but their classic
poets : the epic writers, Ferdowsi (author
of the "Shah-nama" see page 32) and
Nizami; the mystics, Sana'i and Attar;
and the lyric writers, Sa'di and Hafiz
of Shiraz. These are the names most
often on their lips along with those
of Maulavi Jalal al-Din Rumi and
Mulla Jami.
Down the centuries Iran has left its lite¬
rary and linguistic mark on an immense
area, a map of which would take in the
sub-continent of India and Pakistan, go
far into China and south-east Asia and
cover the western half of Asia. Today
a rapidly developing country, Iran is
meeting the thirst for knowledge with
strenuous efforts to spread education.
Yet the more modern side of education,
with its emphasis on science, has by no
means dulled the Iranian taste for poetry
and belles lettres which are being pro¬
duced as abundantly and read, or listened
to, as eagerly as ever.

Two examples of early Iranian craftsmanship. Grey ceramic
vase in the form of a woman (above) dates from 2000 B.C.
It was unearthed from the Shah Tepe (tepe: hill or mound)
in the plain of Gorgan near the Caspian Sea. Below, bone handle
for a flint knife, depicting a man standing with arms crossed,
carved over 6,000 years ago (4200 B.C.). Discovered at
Tepe Siyalk (central Iran), it is 12.5 cm. (5 in.) long.
Craftsmanship of early Iran
Bronze statuette of a robed divinity unearthed
at Pusht-i-Kuh in Luristan (western Iran).
The inscription engraved on the skirt in Cuneiform
characters dates from around 600 B.C.,
but the statue, 37 cm. (15 in.) high, may be older
by several centuries.

Lions and bulls of ancient Persepolis
Powerful figures of bulls and lions, carved nearly 2,500 years ago, adorned
the Hall of a Hundred Columns at Persepolis, capital of ancient Persia under
Darius I. Animals figure on the long friezes sculptured on the walls, stairways
and columns of the palaces and other remains of one of the world's most
impressive historical sites.
