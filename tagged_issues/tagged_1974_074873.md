The Dogon, an African
people living in the
mountains to the south
of Timbuktu, in Mali,
have long been renown-
as accomplished
sculptors in metal and
wood. Dogon wooden
votive figures have sur¬
vived intact for as much
as two centuries lon¬
ger than many African
sculptures in wood.
These slenderly-shaped
carvings of ancestor
figures or mythological
heroes are, like most
Dogon sculpture, inspi¬
red by the ancestor cult.

devote at least two issues to problems
of the Demographic Explosion. Cover
for this issue was specially designed
for the "Unesco Courier" by Polish
artist Roman Ciezlewicz.

1974 has been proclaimed World Population Year
by the United Nations. The purpose of the Year is
to alert world public opinion to one of the major
problems of our time the Demographic Explosion
and to promote a better understanding of the
issues involved, which could lead to positive and
enlightened action on the part of government
authorities and citizens alike. The "Unesco Courier"
lanstc
tant question. This issue presents an overall picture
of the world population situation based on the
most recent demographic studies and enquiries
carried out within the U.N. family. Our double issue
(to be dated exceptionally July-August 1974 instead
of August-September) will deal with the impact of
population growth on the quality of life, economic
development, urbanization ¡and] environment gen-
other challenging issues.

### 1 + 1 = 3: every day over 200,000 more mouths to feed

HE clock is ticking. Every
second there are two additional mouths
to feed. Every day there are 200,000
more births than deaths, six million
more every month. At last count more
than 74 million Individuals were added
to the world population in one year.
And the increase is greater annually.
The effects of today's population
trends will be felt decades and
centuries from now. Measures aimed
at modifying these trends or the
failure to find and implement such
measures will be felt by generations
to come. It is those future generations
who will either reap the benefits or pay
the price for our action or inaction
today.
Because of the great time lag bet¬
ween action and effect, it Is important
to begin today to find out on a global
scale where we are headed. This, in
essence, is the objective of the World
Population Year, 1974, as designated
by the United Nations, and is the
substance of the agenda for the World
Population Conference to be held in
Bucharest (Romania) in August, 1974.
Then, representatives from United
Nations member countries will convene
to discuss, analyse and make recom¬
mendations upon what has become
known, generally, as the "population
problem".
There are differing viewpoints as to
the urgency of the world population
problem; some believe global catas¬
trophe already threatens the human
race due to the vast population in¬
crease multiplied by effects and
demands of industry and technology.
Others are optimistic, seeing the
solution in terms of technological
progress that will meet the needs of
countless more billions. The need for
radical structural reforms of an econ¬
omic, social and political nature on a
world and national scale is often
stressed, and some oppose what they
consider to be an overemphasis on
family planning and population control.
Whatever the differences, there is
wide agreement on certain assumptions
that inevitably relate to population
problems: that nations are more inter
dependent than ever before; that the
rich have an obligation to help the
poor; that no matter how many people
the earth might eventually support, too
many too soon can have, and are
having, harmful effects; that society
should seek to improve the living
standards and the quality of life of all
people; that overcrowding, pollution,
poverty, ignorance, disease, waste of
resources and social alienation must
be eliminated; that the earth itself
fields and forests, lakes and seas is
now measurably affected by man's
activities and must be protected against
man's abuses in order to save mankind;
that children should be born into a
family and a world that wants them;
that nations can and should help one
another and combine their knowledge
for the benefit of all.
The population situation is different
in each country. The United Nations
General Assembly, the Economic and
Social Council and its Population
Commission have frequently em¬
phasized that it is the sovereign right
of each government to establish its
own policy relating to population. Yet
they have also recognized a need for
nations to come together and find
common aims. The World Population
Year, 1974, and the World Population
Conference are expressions of this
position.
"The evidence is all around us," U.N.
Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim ob¬
served in announcing the World Popu¬
lation Year and Conference. "Each
year 127 million children are born, each
year 95 million come of school age and
each year 19 million reach age 65.
These totals are likely to rise steeply
in the years ahead as more young
adults swell the ranks of potential
parents, and improved medical care
advances life expectancy... Each
nation, each community, each family
must assess in detail how these trends
affect their hopes for higher living
standards, a better education, and
greater health and happiness."
World Population Year, 1974 has
been dedicated by the United Nations
to the task of evolving a world consen¬
sus on population matters and a better
understanding of how to deal with
the complex and varied population
problems arising in different forms
throughout the world.

### 1 + 1 = 3: every day over 200,000 more mouths to feed
¿^
The United Nations Population Com¬
mission, a subsidiary body of the
Economic and Social Council, is super¬
vising arrangements for the Year and
Conference. The Commission has
outlined these main objectives of the
Year:
To improve command of the facts
concerning population trends and
prospects and the relevant associated
factors.
To sharpen awareness and heighten
appreciation of population problems
and their implications among individual
governments, non-governmental organ¬
izations, scientific institutions and the
media.
To provide effective education on
population dynamics, family life and
reproductive functions through formal
and other educational systems.
To stimulate discussion and thinking
on alternative policies, promotion of
demographic, consideration in develop¬
ment planning, and development of
policies and programmes in the popu¬
lation field which individual govern¬
ments might wish to undertake.
To expand international co-operation
in population fields and supply in¬
creased and suitable technical assist¬
ance to countries desiring it, in
accordance with their needs.
Development of programmes in those
areas is guided by the following prin¬
ciples:
Respect for the sovereign right of
each nation to decide, on the basis of
informed awareness, what its own
population policy should be.
Respect for the personal right of
a couple to decide the size of the
family.
Recognition of the social and cul¬
tural value differences among nations
and communities, in formulating and
implementing population programmes,
most of which are, therefore, country-
based.
The world population situation is
regarded as a complex matter which
varies in its nature and substance from
place to place rather than as one
responsive to a simplistic overall
solution.

IT took at least a million
years for human numbers to reach the
billion mark. Before the emergence of
settled agriculture perhaps 8,000 years
ago, the world's entire population may
have been from 5 to 10 million. With
more elaborate social organization,
much larger populations could be
sustained, and about 2,000 years ago
the world's population had grown to
between 200 and 400 million in¬
habitants.
The billion mark was reached around
1800, and the second billion arrived
in about 130 years. But the third
billion took only 30 years, and the
fourth will have arrived within only
15 years.
World population growth is the result
of natural increase the excess of
births over deaths. The fall in the
death rate occurred first in the
developed regions, but over the last
thirty years has been operating
spectacularly in Africa, Asia and Latin
America. Small families have become
the rule in the economically advanced
countries but birth rates in the poorer
regions have remained high.
Thus a revolutionary change in the
reproductive balance of the human
species has taken place in modern
times. Never in history had it been
possible to reduce human mortality to
such an extent as witnessed in the past
hundred years or so. The present
decade is confronted with the most
rapid growth of population the world
has ever seen.
Terrible though the losses of human
lives have been in mass killing of
wartime and widespread deaths from
earthquakes, floods, famines and
epidemics, these have not substantially
impeded the growth of population in
the modern period. It has been
calculated that all the national and
regional disasters on record since 1850
may have delayed the growth by no
more than about 10 years. Had there
been no war, famine or epidemic since
1850, the world's population might have
totalled more than 3.5 billion in 1960
instead of in 1970.
Unless disasters occur on a scale
never before known, enormous future
increases in the numbers of mankind
are a virtual certainty. But population
cannot grow forever. If population
growth is not to be cut down by
disasters, it will have to be reduced by
decreases in birth rates decreases
comparable to those which have
already occurred in the death rates.
Thus it has become evident that
there is, as a U.N. panel on population
has stated, "an increasing need for
a global or world-wide look at the
problem of population growth and the
international consequences of national
policies. The world appears to be
approaching a stage where not only
individual decisions will have to be
evaluated in terms of national interest
but also national decisions will have to
be evaluated in terms of the interest of
the world community."
The U.N. panel has pointed out that
zero population growth (ZPG) is
inevitable as a long-run proposition.
Short of natural disaster, man may
bring it about deliberately and by
acceptable means (mainly by controlling
births) or through undesirable means
(such as increased mortality). However,
the experts emphasized that while it is
not unrealistic to expect ZPG to be
achieved in many developed countries
in the foreseeable future, such an
expectation would be quite unrealistic
in regard to the presently developing
countries.
Population policies cannot be con¬
sidered separately from broader ques¬
tions of development, U.N. studies have
revealed. A high level of social and
economic development is generally
accompanied by a reduction in fertility.
Without reduction in the rate of popu¬
lation growth, however, economic
development may be severely jeopar¬
dized. At the same time without
economic development, and without
radical transformation in the structures
of society, reduction in the rate of
population growth will be hard to
achieve. Moreover, reducing the
growth rate will not be enough to solve
the problem of poverty.
All government policies aimed at
economic growth and social develop¬
ment may affect fertility in some way,
the U.N. studies indicate. Certain
policies and programmes aimed at
improvement in welfare may also lower
the benefits and increase the costs of
having children and therefore constitute
policies for limiting fertility; yet, other
policies and programmes may tend to
encourage fertility.
The phenomenal growth of the
human family in the coming decades
may call for new ways of thinking
about man's needs and values. The
vastly increased sizes of population in
every form of settlement in the
largest cities as well as in towns,
villages and the open countryside
may require forms and methods of
economic and social organization
unlike those successfully used in the
past.
Cultural, political and international
circumstances also will cause future

development to differ in many respects
from the past, as will the persistent
shortage and geographical maldistri¬
bution of sources of investment capital.
Some goals of humanity may have
to be reformulated. Revolutions in
thought, feeling and attitude of one
kind or another may become necess¬
ary and, in fact, such radical changes
appear bound to occur. World Popu¬
lation Year offers an appropriate
occasion for all to reflect on the basic
goals and directions of mankind.
Several developing countries, whose
area and resources are extensive in
relation to current population, have
expressed opposition to any world
campaign to limit population.
Brazil, for example, vigorously
pressing this point of view, told a recent
U.N. population meeting that it
could not understand why developed
countries with high population den¬
sities advised less densely populated
countries to be demographically wiser
and to reduce their population growth.
If the developed countries were so
concerned with population growth,
Brazil's representative asked, would it
not be preferable for them to transfer
plants and new investments to devel¬
oping countries, instead of accepting
additions to their labour force from
abroad?
Brazil and other countries argue that
population growth has been over¬
emphasized. Development has always
spread outward from densely-popu¬
lated to thinly-populated areas, they
maintain, and history has shown that
rapid population growth has also been
a sign of development. The solution
to population problems, they say, will
be found only in economic develop¬
ment, and not through action forcing
certain sectors to adopt contraceptive
measures. Brazil advised the inter¬
national community to concentrate on
providing factual information upon
which governments could formulate
programmes and policies.
Chile's delegate to the U.N. General
Assembly said, in November 1970, that
the population growth problem is
"artificially emphasized by developed
countries as an excuse for them to
escape their obligations to the inter¬
national community"; the real need was
"to attack the causes of underdevel¬
opment through an increase in trade
and financial aid, greater access to
modern technology, and co-operation 7
between developed and developing *
countries in all areas of technical
assistance."

POPULATION GROWTH (Continued)
Senegal's representative, declaring
that Europe developed in the 19th cen¬
tury without birth control programmes,
added: "I am aware that the decrease
in mortality rates today adds a new
dimension to the population problem,
but technology has increased the
industrial output. In Senegal it would
be disastrous to limit population since
the population density there is only
seven persons per square kilometre."
Miguel A. Ozorio de Almeida, head
of Brazil's delegation to the U.N. Con¬
ference on the Human Environment,
in Stockholm, in September 1973,
attacked "the attitude that the devel¬
oped countries have demonstrated, by
their development, a special right to
salvation and perpetuation, thus pass¬
ing on to the more numerous under¬
developed peoples the responsibility
for creating the necessary space on
earth... Emphasis upon population
growth, as such, unlinked to the
relationship of the population to the
national resource base including geo¬
graphical space is inadequate and
unacceptable.
"Countries with more than 100, 200,

or even 300 persons per square kilo¬
metre are thus left outside this
approach, while countries with fewer
than 20 inhabitants per square kilo¬
metre are being condemned for demo¬
graphic policies that would bring
about increased economic efficiency
and constitute a necessary condition
for their national integration and fulfil¬
ment as a human community." If
resources were to be shared by a|l
peoples, "then economic power, in¬
dustrial productivity and financial
control should also be shared", he
maintained.

### The Grinding arithmetic for the year 2000
THE GRINDING
ARITHMETIC
FOR THE YEAR 2000
HE decade of the 1970s
may be confronted with a higher rate
of growth than ever experienced
before in the history of man, and one
higher than is likely to be confronted
again in the future.
World population trends for many
years to come will be decisively in¬
fluenced by trends in the developing
regions. These are the conclusions
that emerge from the latest United
Nations projections to the end of the
century, which illustrate the impli¬
cations of the unprecedented growth
in world population brought about by
reductions in mortality accompanied by
little change in the high levels of
fertility in developing regions.
It is important to remember that a
population increasing at an annual rate
of 2 per cent will double in 35 years,
and one increasing at a rate of 3 per
cent will double in 23 years.
According to the "medium" pro¬
jections representing the trend con¬
sidered most plausible the world's
growth rate will be about 2 to 2.1 per
cent per year for the decade. That is
from 1 to 1.1 per cent in the developed
regions but 2.4 to 2.5 per cent in the
less developed regions.
These "medium" projections show
that the world's population may con¬
tinue to grow at a virtually constant
rate of about 2 per cent annually until
1985. A downward trend would then
start, ending at a 1.7 per cent rate by
the end of the century.
In absolute terms, the population
may increase from nearly 4 billion in
1973 to 4.5 billion in 1980, 5.4 billion
in 1990 and 6.5 billion in 2000. The
less developed regions would double
their population to a total of 5 billion
by 2000, or more than three times the
population total of 1.5 billion projected
for developed countries.
The largest addition to the popu¬
lation during the period is expected in
South Asia, which now contains almost
one third of the world's population.
India is the largest contributor to this
area's total. Its population may in¬
crease from 487 million in 1965 to
nearly 1.1 billion by 2000 (an increase
of 123 per cent in 35 years). South
Asia as a whole may have an increase
of 1.4 billion over the 1965 total by
2000, accounting for 43 per cent of the
projected increase in world population.
The next major area of importance
is East Asia where the pace of popu¬
lation growth is expected to be
moderate, but the absolute increase
will be very high. China's population
is projected to increase from 700 million
(1965) to 1.2 billion (2000). Sizeable
increases in total population are also
expected in Latin America from
246 million to 652 million and in
Africa, from 303 million to 818 million.
The world's current 2 per cent
annual rate of increase is not expected
to continue. If it did, population would
soar to a total of 28 billion only a
century from now. If the growth rate
were reduced to 1 per cent after the
year 2000, and if it remained at that
rate, the population in the year 2074
would be about 14 billion.
Among major areas of the world,
rates of population growth are currently
highest in Latin America and South
Asia. Latin America is expected to
maintain the very high rate of 2.8 to
2.9 per cent annually until about 1985
a result of its relatively low mortality
compared to other developing areas
then decrease to 2.6 per cent by the
end of the. century. In South Asia,
where current high growth rates
reflect very high fertility levels, a
gradual decrease is expected, so that
growth would reach about 2 per cent
by the year 2000.
In Africa, the decline in fertility is
not expected to begin until later in the
century. Its population growth rate
may exceed 3 per cent annually in the
1980s, then begin to drop slightly.
Africa may have the world's highest
growth rate well into the 21st century,
and may also be the only area where
the age structure, already unfavourable
for development, may change for the
worse, with the percentage of children
remaining much the same or even
increasing within the next decades.
In the largest country, China, where
birth control practices are reported to
be in wide use, the rate of increase
for the period 1965-1970 was estimated
at 1.8 per cent. On the .other hand,
recent figures for some thirty devel¬
oping countries in Africa, Latin America
and Asia indicate a rate of increase of
about 3 per cent.
These include: In Africa Algeria,
Kenya, Liberia, Libya, Morocco,
Southern Rhodesia, Sudan, Tunisia.
In Latin America Costa Rica, Domi- _
nican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, jl

laysia, Mongolia, Pakistan, Philippines,
Syria, Thailand.
Population is also increasing in
density. In the 1950-1970 period,
63 inhabitants were added to each
square kilometre in Middle South Asia
and 56 in Japan. The Caribbean area
added an average of 38 people per
square kilometre, and in South East
Asia, China and Western Europe
density gains were about 24 to 26 per¬
sons per square kilometre. Gains in
Southern Africa, the Soviet Union,
North America and temperate South
America were modest, each adding
only 3 persons per square kilometre.
One of the major achievements of
our civilization is "death control", the
steady march towards victory over
disease and famine.
Today the inhabitants of most
developed countries can expect to live
70 years or more; the figure is around
76 in Scandinavia. The developing
countries also have benefited from
progress in extending the life span,
but in many of these countries a person
still cannot expect to live more than
50 years, especially in Africa where
life expectation In many countries is
under 40. (In Gabon and Guinea, life
expectancy for men has been estimated
at 25 and 26 years respectively.) In
many Latin American countries, on the
other hand, people can now expect to
live as long as 60 years.
Until about 1850, the demographic
differences between the developed and
developing worlds were slight. In both
there was an average of about
35 deaths and about 40 births per
thousand inhabitants each year. But
after 1850, the death rate In the now
more developed regions decreased
gradually to about 28 in 1850-1900,
about 18 in 1900-1950, and 10 or less
since 1950.
In the less developed regions, the
death rate was still 32 per thousand
from 1900-1950, but by the 1960s it
had dropped sharply to a rate of 17.
In these regions, the drop in mortality
was delayed by nearly a century, and
now is occurring with outstanding
speed.
A further impressive decline in
mortality levels is anticipated in the
less developed regions. An overall
gain of more than 15 years in life
expectancy at birth is expected within
the next 30 years, and the death rate
may decline from about 16 to 7 or
8 per thousand towards the end of the
century.
Because of the more youthful corn-
considered as much of an indicator of
social and economic development as
it was in the past. There are still a
number of countries where about one
out of five live-born infants dies before
its first birthday. But in the past three
decades, the infant mortality rate has
fallen from 106 to 27 per thousand in
more developed regions, and from 230
to 140 per thousand in the less devel¬
oped.
Over the past two centuries the
pattern of an uneasy balance between
births and deaths has been broken.
There are about 125 million births each
year in the world, and about 55 million
deaths roughly in a ratio of 2 to 1.
About four fifths of the births are in
the developing countries.
Few indicators descrimlnate so
sharply between the more developed
and the less developed countries as
do the measures of fertility. The
countries with birth rates of about
30 and gross reproduction rates above
position of their populations, the death
rate in some of the less developed
countries already has fallen as low as
that in some developed countries with
a high proportion of people at an
advanced age. Some developing
regions may attain by the end of the
century the lowest death rate ever
experienced by sizable human so¬
cieties as little as 5 per thousand.
Among the significant features of
recent mortality trends has been a rise
in death rates among middle-aged or
older men in some highly industrialized
countries. In these countries, where
mortality had already reached low
levels and infectious diseases had
been brought 'under control, cardio¬
vascular diseases have become the
most important cause of death.
Infant mortality in some developing
countries has dropped closer to the
level in developed countries and the
infant mortality rate is no longer
2.0 (a gross reproduction rate of 1.0
means an average of one daughter per
woman) are found almost exclusively
in the developing regions in Africa,
Asia and Middle and South America.
Countries with rates below these levels
are located, with few exceptions, in the
economically more advanced regions.
Birth .rates fell substantially in the
19th century in all the now more
developed regions, but hardly at all in
the less developed. The gap has
widened enormously. Typical birth
rates in developed countries are near
20 per thousand, while in developing
countries they are twice as high.
In a number of high-fertility countries,
including some which have adopted
policies and programmes aimed at
reducing the birth rate, there have
been decreases in the birth rate during
the 1960s. But the combined popu¬
lation of countries with an appreciable
drop is small compared to those where
there has been little or no change in
the high birth rate.
In Africa, a belt of very high fertility
extends across West Africa from
Guinea and Mali to Niger and Nigeria.
The countries in this belt have gross
reproduction rates of 3.3 or above.
In Latin America, only slightly lower

### The Grinding arithmetic for the year 2000
rates have been estimated for the
Middle American mainland.
A zone of much lower fertility is
centred in the Congo Basin in Africa
(estimated gross reproduction rates
2.1 to 2.4). In the Caribbean area,
fertility is only moderately high (gross
reproduction rates around 2.5).
In Asia there is a Chinese cultural
zone of rather moderate fertility, with
gross reproduction rates not exceeding
2.8; this zone includes Hong Kong and
Singapore and probably also China,
for which knowledge of fertility levels
is uncertain.
A group of countries in South-East
Asia, including the Philippines, Cam¬
bodia, Thailand and the East Malaysian
States of Sabah and Sarawak, have
estimated gross reproduction rates of
3.2 and higher. Pakistan also appears
to have very high fertility, but a zone
of somewhat lower fertility, with
estimated gross reproduction rates of
2.5 to 2.7, includes India, Nepal, Burma
and Sri Lanka.
Because adequate statistics are not
available, it is impossible to prove
whether in Asia as a whole the birth
rate has changed at all in recent years.
China, which comprises over one fifth
of the world's population, may be
undergoing a slow decline in the birth
rate. Various estimates of long-term
fertility trends in India, the second
largest country with around one
seventh of the world's inhabitants,
indicate either that the birth rate has
shown only a moderate decline since
earlier in the century, or else that it
has remained practically unchanged.
In view of improved health conditions
and reduced widowhood as a con¬
sequence of lower mortality, the ab¬
sence of a rise in fertility may be
looked upon with some optimism.
Birth rates have probably diminished
at least slightly in Latin America as a
whole. In Africa as a whole, it seems
likely that the average birth rate has
not changed perceptibly. It may
actually be increasing in Middle Africa,
although data are lacking to verify
this fact.
For the world as a whole, the birth
rate is projected to decline from 34 to
25 per thousand by the year 2000, with
the death rate dropping from 14 to 8.
As for the more developed regions,
the projections show only slight
changes in the next quarter-century in
regard to crude birth and death rates
(annual number of live births and
annual number of deaths per 1,000
people), gross reproduction rate and
life expectancy.
Even after fertility drops below re¬
placement level of 2 children per
couple, a population can continue to
grow for up to 70 years, due to delays
built into the age structure.
The achievement of world "zero
population growth" by 2000 is highly
unlikely; this would require the total
fertility rate throughout the world to
drop far below replacement level,
reaching 1.1 by 2000. (See page 16.)
Even if the less developed countries
were to achieve a net reproduction
rate of 1 by 2000, they would grow by
about 2.5 times by 2050. If current
fertility remained constant and mor¬
tality declined, the population of the
less developed countries could be
more than 10 times its present size
by 2050.
In the less developed countries
seeking to slow population growth, the
key elements are the starting date and
the speed of the decline in fertility;
these will determine when fertility
levels will approach replacement.
Many developing countries may
quadruple in population within 50 years
if they do not move toward the goal
of a reduced growth rate. Only a few
nations such as the Federal Republic
of Germany, German Democratic
Republic, Austria and Sweden can
expect populations to remain at about
the present level. If a non-growing
population is desired, this is likely to
take several decades in most of the
developed countries, but much longer
in the less developed countries.

A STARTLING PICTURE
A CENTURY FROM TODAY
World population growth cannot possibly stop
before at least a century, the U.N. says
llVEN enough time, reduced
family size will probably become a
universal achievement. But at present,
and for some time to come, there are
also a number of conflicting factors
making it impossible to reduce high
birth rates at once.
Multitudes of people living in
extreme misery are unable to believe
that any sustained behaviour can even¬
tually ease their condition. In many
farming communities where children
are put to work early, they are still
considered, quite rationally, as eco¬
nomic assets. For good economic
reasons, the governments of many
countries, some of them having a
small or sparse population, favour a
population growth which can still be
advantageous to national development.
In the more developed regions, quite
low fertility is already an accomplished
fact. Here, the United Nations projec¬
tions make only a single assumption,
namely, that fertility at a bare repla¬
cement level will be reached fairly
soon, though not immediately and not
simultaneously in every region.
In the less developed regions, many
contradictory arguments can have vali¬
dity, so that there remains a wide
scope for equally reasonable assump¬
tions as to the path which may be
followed by future fertility trends. In
one respect all assumptions agree :
sooner or later fertility will reach the
net replacement level and then fluc¬
tuate about that level. They differ only
as regards the timing and the speed
of the intervening decline. The re¬
sulting " high " and " low " population
projections will be considered further
on. Meanwhile, the discussion is
confined to the " medium " projection
variant.
To appreciate what is implied in the
" medium " variant of the projections,
the reader may wish to take note of
the approximate time by which a rather
low level of fertility is assumed to be
reached in each of eight major areas
of the world. Listed below are the
assumed dates when the gross repro¬
duction rate is charted to fall below
1.10 (i.e. fertility becomes less than
2.25 children per woman) in each of
the eight world areas:
Northern Tier
North America 	 about 2005
Europe 	 » 2000
Soviet Union 	 » 2015
East Asia » 2005
Southern Tier
Latin America 	 » 2030
Africa 	 » 2040
South Asia 	 » 2025
Oceania » 2020
It does not follow that population
growth becomes negligible immedi¬
ately thereafter. Depending on earlier
trends in fertility, there can be a more
or less sizeable proportion of the popu¬
lation at young adult ages boosting the
crude birth rate (the annual number of
live births per 1,000 people) and de¬
pressing the crude death rate (the
annual number of deaths per 1,000
people) thereby causing further popu¬
lation increases. Stabilization can set
in only later on, when the entire age
structure has been sufficiently trans¬
formed.
Those concerned with, or alarmed
by, the impending population increases
may derive some comfort from the
probable fact that the highest rates of
population growth lie in the near future
if not already in the recent past. In
each of the eight major areas of the
world the fastest increases are calcu¬
lated to occur within the present half-
century. When the next century begins
growth will already be slower. The
periods of the peak growth rate, and
the rates of natural increase then
attained, are listed below for each of
the eight world areas:
Northern Tier Date per ® Jqq
North America 	 1955-60 15.6
Europe 	 1950-55 8.8
Soviet Union 	 1955-60 17.6

Africa 	 1985-90 30.0
South Asia 	 1970-75 28.1
Oceania 1955-60 16.9
Though the peak rate of growth may
already be passed, the amounts of
population increase can continue to
rise because the population base to
which the diminishing growth rates
apply still goes on augmenting. Listed
below are the eight major world areas
according to the five-year period when
population increase reaches its largest
absolute amount. Like South Asia,
the entire world population is also
calculated to grow by the largest
amount during 2010-15 when the yearly
addition will total 110 million.

A STARTLING PICTURE (Continued)
Having quickly surveyed the recent
and projected population dynamics in
different world areas, we are perhaps
prepared to accept that the potential
for population growth is far greater in
the southern tier of world regions than
in the north.
South Asia, previously of smaller
population than East Asia, will increas¬
ingly surpass it because of its greater
growth momentum. In fact, the popu¬
lation of South Asia is projected to
soar by huge amounts, and by the
middle of the next century it may sur¬
pass the total world population of
today. But South Asia grows from a
population base which is already large.
Speedier growth is likely to occur else¬
where. High growth rates, sustained
over a longer period, are foreseen
especially for Africa and Latin America.
The populations of North America
and the Soviet Union have already
been surpassed by these two conti¬
nents, despite their own appreciable
rates of growth. In both North
America and the Soviet Union growth
is calculated to abate in the coming
decades, and the. two populations may
remain of nearly equal size for a long
time to come. In this comparison,
Europe seems to grow rather slowly.
But even Europe may reach in the
coming century a population size
double that of 1925.
Confining our attention to the future
only, we may say that between 1975
and 2075 the population of Europe may
grow by another half and those of
North America, the Soviet Union and
East Asia may double. Meanwhile
in Oceania growth may be two-and-a-
half-fold, in South Asia almost fourfold,
in Latin America almost five-fold, and
in Africa nearly sixfold.
Past and anticipated future growth
differ so much between the northern
and the southern tier of world areas
that an entire century can be envisaged
during which the speed of growth in
the south exceeds the maximum ever
attained in the north. The fastest
growth of the north may have already
occurred during 1950-1975, when the
annual rate averaged 1.4 per cent.
Rates higher than this level may prevail
in the south during all quarter-centuries
from 1925 to 2025.
One consequence of such different
rates of growth is a large displacement
southward of the centre of gravity of
world population. Three-fifths of man¬
kind inhabited the northern regions in
1925, and still about one-half in 1975;
in the coming century, the share of the
north is apt to dwindle to one-third if
not less. In 1925, one in every six
persons in the world was a European,
whereas in 2075 it may be only one
in every seventeen.
Roughly the opposite occurs in the
case of Africa, rising from a small
fraction to a considerable proportion
of the world's population. (See table
top p. 30.) If the meteoric rise in the
economic needs of the southern
portions of humanity is to be met, not
only economic development but also

of world population betweenthe years 1960 and 2075 on a scale and with
a speed unprecedented in human history. The almost exponential curve
forms the bowl of the goblet. The width of the goblet represents the total world population. Note the sharp
difference between population growth in the 1850-1960 period (stem of goblet) and the years following. A
further constant growth period is apparent after the year 2075. The diagram shows eight major world areas
along with their populations and indicates the year when the population in each will cease growing (around
the year 21 20 for Africa, with 2,338 million inhabitants; around 2070 for Europe, with 698 million inhabitants).

N February of this year the
United Nations Economic and Social
Council published the findings of its
second world inquiry on population and
development carried out with the
governments of 80 countries. The
inquiry "was made with the co¬
operation of the United Nations
Economic Commissions for Europe,
Asia, Latin America, and Africa, and
sought to determine trends as regards
government attitudes and policies
towards population.
The inquiry revealed that in a con¬
siderable number of countries the
population problem seems to be mainly
confined to matters concerning the rate
of natural increase. Many countries
directly linked population policies with
economic, social and political actions.
The Government of Egypt, while
emphasizing the primary role of social
and economic development, also gives
due consideration to demographic
policy and action.
In its response, Panama declared:
"In Panama it is believed that the
problem is not situated in the control
of population growth but rather in the
elimination of poverty. This problem
requires the execution of a broad eco¬
nomic and social policy which provides
for just and favourable working condi¬
tions and assures equal opportunities
for all."
A statement made by the Chinese
observer at a meeting in Geneva of
the United Nations Population Commis¬
sion in November 1973, implies a simi¬
lar position.
"We have learned from our own
experience", Mr. Yu said, "that it is
erroneous and untruthful to say that
over-population is the main cause of
the poverty and backwardness of the
developing countries of Asia, Africa
and Latin America and that a popula¬
tion policy is decisive in solving the
problems of poverty and backward¬
ness... China pursues a policy of dev¬
eloping her national economy in a
planned way, including the policy of
planned population growth. We do
not approve of anarchy either in phy¬
sical production or in human repro¬
duction."
The view of the Soviet Union is
expressed as follows:
"Historical experience shows that
population growth cannot be an obsta¬
cle to economic and cultural develop¬
ment. Since social life is based on the
conditions and level of material pro¬
duction, the solution of the problem
of harmonizing economic and social
.development and population growth

consists not in adjusting population
growth to the growth of the economy,
as is the case in family planning, but
in ensuring rates of economic growth
which will exceed population growth
rates and guarantee a rise in the
standard of living of the people.
However, some countries clearly
state that they have encountered great
difficulties in raising the standard of
living of their population, while simul¬
taneously sustaining a high rate of
population growth.
The Tunisian Government reports
that it "is profoundly aware of the near-
impossibility of raising the standard of
living per inhabitant, of solving the
employment problem, or even of con¬
tinually ensuring the present rate of
school attendance if the current rate
of population growth continues."
It has adopted a number of legisla
tive measures (postponement of age
at marriage, limitation of family allow¬
ance to four children, liberalization of
abortions for social reasons...)
The Government of Thailand also
considers the high rate of population
growth as an impediment to economic
and social development: its policy sup¬
ports voluntary family planning.
The U.N. Report summarizes its find¬
ings in the major regions of the world
as follows:
Africa
Clear indications on the goals of
national population policies are given
in the responses of three out of 15
African countries. These are Egypt,
which is seeking to reduce its birth
rate to 30 per thousand by 1978,
Kenya, also striving to lower the birth
rate, and Tunisia where the long-term
target is to attain the present level of
fertility in Italy (17 per thousand) by
the end of the century.
In Madagascar and Swaziland there
are good prospects that family planning
will be given higher priority in the
development plans of these countries.
Ethiopia, Liberia, Malawi and Zambia
have not yet formulated any population
policy, although Ethiopia has under¬
taken a number of population studies.
Liberia expects to develop a policy
after the population and housing cen¬
sus of 1974.
North America

does not have an officially formulated
population policy it takes a positive

LOW FERTILITY
We publish below two views on the population problem.
Frank W. Notestein, the "father of American demography",
has fostered for over 30 years the point of view that the
problem is not simply a matter of choosing between
development and family planning but is to use family
planning as an important part of the development process.
A different position is presented by another American
demographer, Julian L. Simon.

### Population control? Economic development would be simplified by a drastic reduction of fertility in the less developed countries
'Economic development
would be simplified by
a drastic reduction
of fertility in the
less developed countries.'
by Frank W. Notestein
HE world's people are at best little
interested in population growth per se. It is a planner's
abstraction. But everywhere they express not the slightest
ambiguity about wanting to be more prosperous, and no
one with compassion can face the tragic poverty prevalent
in most of the world without feeling the urgent need for
great increases in material well-being, especially among the
poorest peoples. Our first premise, therefore, is :
Population policies must be geared to fostering the
processes of economic development and the more equitable
distribution of income. Moreover, no population policy can
be a substitute for economic development. Poverty can
only be cured by enhanced production.
The fund of life is renewed and maintained by near
balances of birth and death, of which there are two polar
types : the inefficient one, based on very high birth rates
cancelled by very high death rates, and the efficient one,
based on low birth and death rates. If these two combina¬
tions exhausted the possibilities there can be no doubt
as to which combination people would universally choose
for themselves. In all normal circumstances, given a
realistic choice, people prefer health and survival to
sickness and death.

### Population control? Population growth produces better economic performance in the long run than does a stationary population

'Population growth produces
better economic performance
in the long run than does
a stationary population.'
by Julian L. Simon
IIN the past decade popular
journalism, and even some of the
scientific press, has presented only a
single set of views of the effects of
population growth on economic growth,
and this view has therefore become
accepted as received truth.
This set of views is that (1) in
Less-Developed Countries (now often
abbreviated LDC) lower population
growth means faster economic dev¬
elopment (2) in More-Developed
Countries (abbreviated MDC) lower
population growth means higher per-
worker output and income; and (3)
continued population growth means
world-wide disaster, as described in
the Club of Rome's Limits to Growth.
But these conclusions and analyses
are not necessarily correct though
JULIAN L. SIMON, of the United States,
is Professor of Economics and of Mar¬
keting at the University of Illinois. In
recent years he has studied such topics
in economic demography as the effects
of population growth on economies, the
welfare economics of additional children
and cost-benefit analysis of birth control
campaigns. At present he is completing
a research volume on the economics of
population growth. This text is "n abridged
version of a paper he delivered at Unesco's
Conference on Law and Population, held
in Paris in February 1974.
they may be, of course. Therefore to
push ahead with anti-natalist laws on
the assumption that these views are
correct might be a tragic mistake
from the economic as well as human
points of view.
fere are some of the reasons why
it is not an open-and-shut case that
population growth is a bad thing in
More-Developed Countries.
Most important is that whether popu¬
lation is now too large, or is growing
too fast, cannot be decided on scien¬
tific grounds alone. This judgement
depends upon one's values, a matter
about which science must be silent.
Science can only reveal the likely
implications of various policies. The
judgement about which policies are
good or bad and which policies should
be chosen rests squarely upon one's
values. Whether you think that it is
better for a country to have a popu¬
lation, say, of 50 million human beings
at $4,000 per year per capita income,
or 100 million human beings at
$3,000, is strictly a matter of what you
consider important.
Therefore, a judgement that popu¬
lation growth is too fast or too slow
is not a scientific judgement, but
rather a value judgement.
Historical and cross-national com¬
parison data give no reason to believe

### Population control? Economic development would be simplified by a drastic reduction of fertility in the less developed countries
L°w fert/Kty
and economic
growth
(Continued from page 22)
The polar combinations of high birth and death rates or
low birth and death rates do not exhaust the options.
Our choice, however, is limited. High death rates chroni¬
cally coupled with low birth rates lead to extinction, and
high birth rates coupled indefinitely with low death rates
are impossible in a finite world.
In principle, high birth rates can be coupled with an
epoch of low death rates to be followed by an epoch of
high death rates. But a systematic policy of seeking
longevity now at the cost of short life later seems a particu¬
larly vicious means of visiting the sins of the fathers on the
children of the coming generations. It surely is not
something that the world seeks to do as a matter of
principle.
I

F we pursue this line of thought, we must quickly
come to our second premise that:
The ultimate goal of the world's population policy
must be to achieve an equilibrium based on low birth and
death rates that can be sustained throughout a distant
future for the world and its several parts.
The fact that a demographic equilibrium based on low
birth and death rates is the option that all the world would
ultimately choose for itself if it could, does not mean that
it is immediately either necessary or desirable. Therefore,
our third premise is that :
Policies supporting population growth, or its necessary
concomitants, must find their justification as desirable
way-stations on the path to stability, health, and prosperity.
The foregoing do not incorporate the only, or even the
most important, human values. The values are among the
most universal, and their attainment would require fulfilling
other ; universal wants, such as the need for education.
Certainly all of us would put our right to political freedom,
to philosophical and religious beliefs of our choosing, and
to opportunities to pursue a life of personal fulfilment on
still higher planes. None of these, however, need come into
conflict with the universally wanted equilibrium of healthy
prosperity. They would not, that is, given the essential
condition for policy formulation at the international level
that:
No one is free to advocate for others policies that in
similar circumstances he would not be willing to accept
for himself and his family.
In the light of these goals, what can be said about the
costs and benefits of population growth?
Clearly there are cases in which growth is needed to
provide a large enough population to reap the economies
of large-scale production. But most countries that need a
larger area to provide the economies of scale could
attain it much more rapidly by lowering the barriers to
international trade than by waiting for their populations to
grow, however fast.
It is possible for a nation to be too sparsely settled to
be efficient, but there are not very many such cases and
the existence of empty space does not provide the proof.
There is usually a reason for low density such as the
limited nature of the resources, the vagaries or severities
of the climate, the prevalence of disease, the displacement
of labour by machines, and the lack of political stability
or of communications with the outside world. It would be
well if governments could face the fact that there are a
great many places and conditions in which people simply
do not want to live.
In some instances, however, areas have been kept
relatively empty for reasons that modern technology and
the control of disease have made irrelevant. In these
circumstances rapid growth may be needed. It is a fair
indication that more rapid growth is needed in a region
when its wage rates are high in terms of the national average,
and when the stream of internal migration is moving in that
direction already. All too often the empty spaces that we
are told need more population prove, on closer inspection,
to have wages that are lower than the national average and
are experiencing a net outward movement of people.
In such instances "too little" population really means too
little population to provide owners with opportunities for
efficient exploitation.
The need for larger numbers is often urged on non-
economic grounds. It is necessary for national power, or
simply as a matter of prestige. Surely there never was
an age when such reasoning should have less force. The
world has always been led by the people with superior
technology, and it was never more true than in the atomic
age, when the world can be ruined but cannot be ruled
by aggression.
Nor would one think much attention would be given to
population size as a matter of prestige. Quite clearly many
of the world's small healthy and wealthy nations draw more
admiration and exert more influence than countries many
times their size. One only has to think of the countries
of Western Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand to
realize how little either power or influence turns on issues
of population size.
In short the number of cases in which a rational argument
can be made that larger numbers are needed is very small.
A much stronger case can be made that the world needs
smaller rather than larger numbers. This case does not
rest as much on the paucity of resources as is often thought.
Good land is in short supply, but recent history has shown
that capital and skill can be fairly effective substitutes.
We hear a great deal of talk about nearing the end of
economic growth because of a shortage of resources and
of mounting pollution.
It seems to me that the world has never been so close
to being able to obtain a supply of basic resources beyond
the imaginings of all previous generations. At least this
is my reading of the prospects for virtually unlimited energy
from the nuclear sources.
With an almost unlimited supply of cheap energy, vast
supplies of low-grade minerals become potentially available
for use and recycling. It seems to me that modern science
and technology have the capacity of bringing the world's
production of both food and manufactured goods to levels
about which we have as yet scarcely dreamed.
Nor do the risks of pollution negate this potentiality.
The problems are serious but they do not lie as much in the
nature of our technology as in our faulty economic arrange¬
ments, whereby the polluter and his product do not bear
the social costs of the pollution. Obviously it will be
expensive to clean up, but the expense is one that a truly
prosperous society can well afford. We may well be at the
beginning rather than the end of economic growth.

that faster population growth is asso¬
ciated with lower economic achieve¬
ment in More-Developed Countries.
One piece of historical evidence is the
difficulty of France to excel economi¬
cally despite its low birth rate in the
past 100 years.
The experience of various More-Dev¬
eloped Countries displaying 10-year
rates of growth of population and out¬
put per capita for those for which data
are available for periods of roughly
90 to 115 years, and roughly 43 to
70 years, respectively, show no clear
relationship between population growth
and economic growth.
when they speak as
citizens rather than as scientists, there
is not consensus among scientists that
there is now overpopulation in the
United States, or that population
growth in the United States is too fast
for the good of the U.S. or for the good
of the world. For example, Ansley
Coale, as respected a demographer as
there is in the world, does not judge
that there is a population crisis in the
United States (though he does worry
about population growth in poor
countries).
Frank Notestein, the elder statesman
of American demographers, finds
nothing but "aesthetic grounds" for
wishing to slow population growth in
the U.S. "I would like to come to zero
population growth, but with no great
haste, and without making important
sacrifices in the process."
But Notestein's and Coale's mes¬
sages are less exciting than the alarms
about impending starvation, misery,
death, and oblivion sounded by those
who favour population control. The
drama of such alarms may account for
the wider publicity they have received.
This is simply because an additional
baby this year does not produce goods,
but he does consume goods; so if the
pie is the same size and there are
more claimants to it, each must receive
a smaller share.
But though this kind of simple-
minded arithmetic is at the base of
most reasoning about the economic
effects of population growth, it really
tells us nothing about the effects of
population growth upon the economy.
To understand population growth's
effects we must understand its effect
upon output per worker. This is a

growth
longer-run concept, and much more
complex.
The discrepancy between the facts
and the theory has provoked various
explanations:
1. Population growth provides a
"challenge" which evokes the "res¬
ponse" of increased effort by indi¬
viduals and societies.
2. There are advantages in having
proportionately more youth in the
labour force.
3. Growth in population creates
additional opportunities which facilitate
changes in the MDC economy and the
society.
4. Faster population growth causes
faster growth of technological knowl¬
edge and its adoption.
Among these explanations, the fourth
is both the most impressive and also
the easiest to integrate with con¬
ventional economic theory and its
Malthusian element of diminishing
returns.
I performed an analysis to quantify
the technological-advance factor in
order to arrive at an overall estimate
of the effects of population growth
upon per-worker income in a devel¬
oped country. I found that areas with
larger rates of population growth, after
initially falling behind in per capita
income, usually overtake areas with
lower rates of population growth, in
much less than half a century in some
cases. That is, though an increment
of population initially has a negative
effect upon economic welfare, after
some decades the effect has become
positive.
This analysis should not be taken to
prove that population growth is
definitely good in the long run in More-
Developed Countries. But it should
be evidence enough that population
growth is not clearly bad.
In the very short run say next
year it is unquestionable that per
capita income will be lower if there
are more children than otherwise. If
there are more babies, almost the same
amount of food will still be produced,
but it will be split among more mouths.
Furthermore, more babies mean greater
demands on public resources more
health care immediately, and more
schooling which means that resources
will be pulled away from other possible
uses that might otherwise help raise
per capita income. The point is that
babies consume but do not produce.
In the somewhat longer run, more
babies today mean that people will be
added to the labour force in a few
years, but land and capital will be no
bigger than otherwise at least at
first. So production output per
worker will be lower than otherwise,
with negative effects on income per
person (*).
Furthermore, these effects cumulate.
More children may also reduce house¬
hold saving, which may increase the
cumulative effect. As the effect grows
at compound interest, the lower-birth¬
rate case achieves an even greater
advantage in per capita income over
the higher birth-rate-case for a while,
anyway, say 50 years.
B'UT the data do not support
this a priori reasoning. First, there is
again the historical fact that population
grew at an unprecedented rate during
the period of Europe's develop¬
ment from 1650-1750 onwards when
European countries were Less-Devel¬
oped Countries. Economic historians
have concluded that slower demo¬
graphic growth would have ham¬
pered England's economic develop¬
ment during the Industrial Revolution.
And there is no significant correlation
in the historical series of population
growth and economic growth over the
past century or half century in those
countries now regarded as developed.
Second, the evidence from among
the presently-developing countries on
the overall relationship between con¬
temporary population growth and
economic growth certainly does not
reveal a consistent pattern.
Richard Easterlin finds "that there
is little evidence of any significant
association, positive or negative, bet¬
ween the income and population
growth rates."
Simon Kuznets compiled data on
21 countries in Asia and Africa, and
19 countries in Latin America. In
the separate samples, and in the
40 countries together, there is not a
significant negative correlation bet¬
ween population growth and growth of
per capita product; the relationships
are actually positive though very weak.
Jean-Claude Chesnais and Alfred
Sauvy last year analysed the relation¬
ship between demographic and econ¬
omic growth in the 1960s for various
samples of up to 76 Less-Developed
Countries and found non-significant
correlations (mostly slightly positive).
These overlapping empirical studies
by world famous specialists certainly
do not show that fast population
growth in Less-Developed Countries

(*) Output per worker or output per worker
hour, and not Income per person or income
per consumer equivalent, is the appropriate ftf
measure of the productive power of an
economy. And productive power rather than
the quantity of consumption would seem to
be the underlying concept in economic devel¬
opment.

Low fertility
and economic growth
(Continued from page 24)
It is to be earnestly hoped that we are at the beginning,
because it is poverty that is the great destroyer. It is
poverty so abject that the future takes a terrible discount
against the needy present; poverty that destroys the forests
and soils, that lets the rivers flood, that malnourishes the
children into stupidity, debilitates them with disease, and
Withholds knowledge of the earth's potential. Poverty is the
great destroyer.
The potentialities are great but the realities are grim.
The constraints of high density in purely extractive
economies are clear. In the less developed countries
population densities often are already so great that simple
systems of production are no longer adequate to prevent
crushing poverty. The real risks are those of coupling
complexity and high density with poverty. Complex modern
economic systems are highly productive, but they are so
completely Interlocked as to be vulnerable to disruption.
In the rich countries, where there is ample room for
retrenchment in times of turmoil, the risks are tolerable.
But in the less developed countries, where large proportions
of the population live close to the margins of subsistence,
the risks of complexity are grave, as the recent history of
starvation during major civil disturbance amply proves.
Complex systems of production in poor countries with
high population density may prove to be lethal in times
of trouble, but the populations are often already so large
that the absence of complex economies would be lethal in

### Population control? Economic development would be simplified by a drastic reduction of fertility in the less developed countries
_ft normal times. The problems of economic and social
yR development would be much simpler if the densely settled
countries had smaller populations. Their huge numbers
already present substantial obstacles to the modernizing
process on which all hope for future welfare depends.
To say that rather few countries actually need larger
populations to support their social-economic development
is not at all the same thing as saying that further population
growth is undesirable. Throughout the world, with very few
exceptions,' it would require an . almost cataclysmic
disturbance to stop population growth immediately. In the
vast majority of countries an immediate end to growth could
only be attained by a two or three-fold increase in death
rates, which would not only violate our basic values, but in
all probability be sufficiently disorganizing to set back the
entire developmental process.
Even in those cases in which one can imagine that
population growth might be stopped immediately by drastic
declines in fertility it is doubtful that such a development
would be desirable. In almost all of the countries the
higher birth rates of the past have left populations with
rather large proportions of youth. As these large numbers
of youth move into the childbearing ages, even if they bear
only enough children to replace themselves, there will be
many more births than deaths. Indeed, if fertility were
to fall to the replacement level immediately, it would take
more than 75 years to bring population growth to a complete
halt in most countries.
It seems quite impossible to reduce populations in the
near future or even to bring growth to a quick end. But
it should be possible to reduce the extremely high rates of
population growth that characterize particularly the most
poverty stricken of the less developed countries. Today
most of them are growing more rapidly than ever before
in their history.
Many learned discussions have developed about the
economic consequences of such growth. To me the issue

increases per capita income. But they
certainly do imply that one should not
confidently assert that population
growth decreases per capita economic
growth in Less-Developed Countries.
When the theory and the data do
not jibe, either (or both) may need
re-examination. To re-examine the
theory I made a number of studies
embodying not only the usual factors
affecting population and economic
growth, but also other considerations.
For instance, population growth may
induce people to work longer hours.
Kusum Nair, a close observer of rural
India, makes us sadly aware of how the
lack of aspirations and other psycho¬
logical make-up keep Indian agri¬
culturalists from striving and working
longer hours. If one decides to work
longer hours for more product,
different sorts of- production techniques
make sense. This is what happened
when men were forced to abandon the
heavy-land-using hunting and grazing
ways of life to work hard at primitive
agriculture.
The shift to more intensive use of
the land then makes more room for
even more people. Then later there
will again be a press upon resources.
Again people are pushed to work
harder and use more advanced tech¬
niques: And so on. Clearly this has
been the story of the growth of
civilization.
The results of the simulation suggest
that positive population growth pro¬
duced considerably better economic
performance in the long run (120 to
180 years) than does a stationary
population, though in the short run
(60 years) the stationary' population
has very slightly better performance.
A declining population does very badly
in the long run. And in the exper¬
iments with the "best" estimates for
a representative Asian Less-Developed
Country, moderate population growth
doubling over 50 years has better
long-run performance than either fast
population growth (doubling over
35 years) or slow population growth
(doubling over about 200 years).
It will surprise almost no one that
very high birth rates are not best.
But the outcome that very substantial
birth rates produce higher incomes in
the long run than do low birth rates
runs against the conventional wisdom.
The standard response when some¬
one questions the need to immediately
check, population growth in More-
Developed Countries is a series of
calculations about how after a certain
number of doublings of population
there will be only standing room, or a
solid mass of human bodies, on earth
or in the More-Developed Countries.
This apparently shows that popu¬
lation growth must stop sometime. Of
course population growth must stop
sometime, just like any other growth
process must stop sometime. But the
question is must growth stop now?
And the standing-room-only sort of
argument is quite inapplicable at this
point in time.
Population alarmists assume that if
we do something now we will inevitably
continue to do the same in the future.
But one need not believe that if people
decide to have more children now, they
will also continue indefinitely to have
them at the same rate.
By analogy, because a man decides
to have another bite of pie today does
not mean that we should worry that he
will eat himself to death. . If he is like
most people, he will stop after he
recognizes a reasonable limit. But
many seem to .have a different model
of people and fertility, that of the
drunkard; if he takes one drink, he's
down the road to hell.

growth
{Continued from page 26)
seems quite straightforward. The less developed countries
are bearing the enormous costs of modernizing their
educational systems, their methods of disease control, their
agricultural production, their manufacturing equipment,
their transport and their civic services. It is unfortunate
that they have to carry at the same time the burden of the
most rapid population increases of their histories. With
the technology in transition, it is bound to be difficult at best
to find productive roles for all of the population, but the
problems are vastly complicated when the stream of entering
workers doubles in size every two or three decades.
The nexus of problems centering on the expansion of the
food supply is particularly difficult. The less developed
nations of dense settlement need to triple their food supply
by the end of the century to improve the diet of populations
that are expected to be twice their present size by that time.
Agricultural specialists seem to believe that it is technically
possible for the Green Revolution to achieve that goal if
all goes well.
But such gains can only be made by a high degree of
modernization which depends on other inputs than
conventional labour. In short, in order to produce the
amount of food required, substantially smaller proportions
of the labour force can be used in agriculture. There may
well be massive flights from the land, of which the present
trek to the city is only the beginning. The resulting train
of unemployment and underemployment in urban squalor
may well threaten the maintenance of political coherence,
with its attendant risk of disorder and death from sweeping
starvation and disease.
HIS agricultural displacement seems to me to carry
the most serious threat to welfare of the next decades.
The cure lies partly in the use of labour-intensive methods,
but still more in the development of non-agricultural industry
with all its heavy requirements for training and capital
investment. Rapid agricultural and non-agricultural develop¬
ment may well be essential to avoid the most serious of
human tragedies in the next decades.

countries, faced with this spectacular
to see, in the future as they have in
portions of the developmental effort
the minimum requirements of growing
contributing to the enrichment of life,
that these problems would be simpl
of the rate of population increase.
There is coming to be very general agreement with this
view that the rate of population growth needs to be reduced,
particularly in the less developed countries. The main
objection one hears now is that other things are more
important. Of course they arel One must protect the
living before giving heed to the future. But this is precisely
the viciousness of rapid population growth in this setting.
Today's needs are so pressing we can scarcely look ahead.
It Is difficult to escape the conclusion that the problems of
economic development would be greatly simplified if the
rate of population growth could be cut by a drastic reduction
of fertility in the less developed countries.
The problems of the more developed countries are much
less severe. Their fertility is already quite low, often close
to, and sometimes below, the level required for the long-run,
maintenance of a stationary population. Their populations
are large, and are close to an equilibrium situation. It is
to be hoped that they set their targets at or a bit below
this replacing level and then concentrate on problems of
the quality of life in a situation that is in equilibrium with
the environment.
The conclusion is clear. We have an additional reason
for fostering social-economic development. It is essential
to alleviate the poverty of existing populations and to
provide for the larger numbers which the future will almost
inevitably bring. But also it is needed to foster the
motivation for reduced childbearing which will be needed
if our efforts at modernization are not to be frittered away
in support of ever larger numbers living in poverty. There
seems to be no major group opposing this position.
The difficulty lies, not in disagreement, but in lack of
serious commitment in a world preoccupied with more
Immediate problems in which its parochial interests are
sharply involved. Perhaps demographers, who led the way
in calling attention to the importance of development in the
transformation of value structures, have paid little attention
to economic development as a specific population policy on
the simple grounds that if development is not undertaken
for itself, it will not be undertaken because it should help to
reduce birth rates.
There Is every reason to believe that strong family
planning programmes can help slow the rate of population
growth. It is sometimes urged that programmes designed
to spread contraceptive practice are irrelevant where the
large family system remains intact and parents want more
rather than fewer children. This interpretation is too simple.
There is a wide diversity of values in every society. The
predominance of the traditional system does not preclude
the presence of the emerging system In some degree.
The problem is to support the new values that are centered
on fewer children to whom better opportunities for health,
education, and prosperity can be given.
One way to foster the new values is to make it possible
for those already motivated to limit their childbearing as
simply and effectively as possible, thereby gaining
community examples of the merits of the smaller family.
It is true that values mediate behaviour, but it is also
true that behaviour mediates values, as any observer of
fashions in dress must agree. Probably there is no more
effective means of communicating the small-family ideal

### Population control? Economic development would be simplified by a drastic reduction of fertility in the less developed countries
than to support the efforts of those already motivated by
making contraception simple, attractive, and inexpensive
to practise.
In addition, serious educational programmes are also
needed. Such programmes should draw upon as wide a
range of legitimating authority as the medical, religious,
and governmental leaders can supply. The essential
message, however, has nothing to do with national popu¬
lation. It should be concentrated on the advantages in the
modern world of smaller families to both children and
parents and on the nature of services available for their
attainment.
Such work should not be thought of as a substitute for
programmes in the fields of health and education which
are so clearly a part of the modernising process and
desirable in their own right. Moreover, since the wanted
innovation can be used as an excellent carrier for those
that are needed but less well understood, it is often
desirable to combine family planning with the maternal-
child health services.

cally and without rational control. (For
a summary of the evidence see Julian
L. Simon "The Effects of Income on
Fertility" published by Chapel Hill:
Carolina Population Centre, 1974.)
Eventually most parents in present-
day poor countries will be able to
expect that all their children will live
to maturity. At such time parents will
bear just as many children as they
want, and no more. And at such time
the birth rate will be much lower than
it now is in poor countries, being
instead like what it is today in the
countries where life expectancy is high.
The birth rate may still be high
enough for population to grow at a
substantial rate, but this will respond
to what people can afford, just as
within industrialized countries a rise in
income seems to increase the birth
rate, and a drop in income (as in the
depression of the 1930s) lowers the
birth rate.
LLL this seems* pretty sure,
barring cataclysm; the question is how
soon it will come about.
The quickest and surest route to the
rosy situation portrayed above is,
I think, by further increasing life
expectancy, and especially by reducing
child mortality. Recent empirical
studies have shown that when child
mortality falls, the birth rate falls, too.
And the best way to reduce child
mortality is by better nutrition.
Until mortality falls very low, parents
will continue to have more children
than they want, on the average,
because of" the conservative but
rational desire to err on the high side
rather than the low side. That is,
parents are more willing to chance
having too many children rather than
too few, too many sons rather than
none.
Recent analyses have shown that if
people really do behave in this fashion,
the effect of a fall to a very low
mortality rate could have a terrific
effect on the birth rate in poor
countries, in exactly the direction the
popu'ation-control enthusiasts wish.
It is interesting that many Asians
econo""c¿ro^S
who work in their population pro¬
gramme have come around to this
general viewpoint of their "population
problem". But some Westerners have
the opposite view with respect to
death control. They would lessen the
emphasis on increasing life expectancy.
But I am sure that to postpone the
drop in mortality will not achieve what
population-control extremists want as
well as will perfect death control and
it is morally abhorrent, too, at least
to me.
Pollution is a red herring in dis¬
cussions of population. Pollution can
be prevented if we put our minds and
our money to it. Man can clean up
the mess that man makes without
limiting births. In little more than a
decade England has cured pollutions
that lasted for a century, and probably
made England a healthier environment
than it ever was.
Trash and junk accumulation surely
is one of the easiest problems to
dispose of. Berlin built seven hills of
World War II rubble which now add to
the beauty of the city, I'm told. In flat
central Illinois where I live we could
certainly benefit from a hill built of old
cars and glass bottles, hammered down
with pile drivers and covered with a
layer of dirt and trees. This would
provide climbing in the summer, skiing
in the winter. Rather than being a
liability, our solid waste could be
a blessing to us.
It seems to me that modern man in
his populousness has great power to
make his environment even better than
primitive man found it. And an im¬
mediate decrease in the birth rate is
quite irrelevant to most immediate
pollution problems. This is especially
true because the main determinant of
the total amount of pollution potential
is Gross National Product, and babies
don't affect GNP for 20 years or so.
Many fear that if there are more
people now, there will be less
resources left for people in the future.
But in any case, we need not assume
that more people now mean less
energy, water, air, building materials
and fertile soil in the future. We
should have learned by the fate of the
prediction made in 1865 by Stanley
Jevons, one of the century's truly great
social scientists, that England's in¬
dustry would soon grind to a halt due
to exhaustion of England's coal.
Those who worry about natural re¬
sources seem to have "out-go vision".
They are like someone who sees only
his record of expenditures and assumes
that he must be on his way to going
broke failing to see that at the same
time there is income, which may well
yield a positive balance. Many people
note our use of resources but fail to
see our creation of resources planting
of forests, exploration of new oil fields
and invention of ways to obtain oil
from rock, discovery of substitute
sources of energy and nutrients, in¬
vention of new tools of all kinds.
Clearly we now have available to us
vastly more resources ot almost every
kind than did people in any preceding
age. And there is no reason to doubt
that this process of the expansion
of resources will continue in the
forseeable future that is, as far into
the future as we can sensibly plan
for now.
Some people argue that there is
one resource that is inevitably dim¬
inished as population grows space.
It is getting harder to find spots in
the West where a man can camp for
a week in perfect solitude, it is said,
and more people will make it even
harder.
It is true that more people in the
U.S., say, would mean less chance to
be able to enjoy the wilderness of
Montana in solitude. But this does not
by itself suggest that more people are
a bad thing. Rather, it only suggests
that you must balance your desire for
space and privacy against your other
values about humanity, including the
number of people you think should
enjoy life.
Also, though one's chance for soli¬
tude would indeed be diminished by a
bigger population, this does not mean
that the overall effect of more people
is less privacy and opportunity to enjoy
nature. Clearly one's opportunities to
enjoy nature are greater than were any
city dweller's a hundred years ago
because people invented the auto and
airplane, and created roads. And your
chances of enjoying a variety of wil¬
derness all over the world are much
greater than anyone's were 100 years
ago, even a prince's.
ONCERNING valuesthis
is really the key issue in judgements
about population growth. Let us be
absolutely clear on this: All judge¬
ments about popu'ation size hinge on
value judgements. Economists, for
example, have long used the concept
of "optimum population" for a given
country, and this sounds very scientific.
But these discussions about optimum
population sizes or growth rates must
have some criterion of better and
worse, and this criterion is usually per-
capita income of the present popu¬
lation, including "quality of life" con¬
siderations.
No one, however, is prepared to take am
the per-capita income criterion to its /M
logical conclusions. Two implications
of this criterion are:

the development of science and tech¬
nology will have to include efforts to
make more efficient use of resources
in warm and tropical climates.
Another aspect of population distri¬
bution is its relationship to land area.
For instance, in 1975 Europe is still the
most densely inhabited major area,
with 97 persons per square kilometre
of land. In the second half of the
coming century, density is apt to
become nearly as great in Latin Ame¬
rica and Africa, whereas South Asia,
is likely to become, the majority in
each region. The urbanization level
surpassed fifty per cent since about
1920 in North America and Oceania,
about 1930 in Europe, about 1960 in
the Soviet Union, and about 1965 in
Latin America. It is projected to reach
fifty per cent about 1995 in East Asia,
about 2015 in Africa and about 2025
in South Asia.
The estimated amounts of urban
population show that the number of
urban dwellers in the world has grown

with perhaps 240 persons per square
kilometre, is likely to become the most
densely settled major area of the
world. (See table bottom of page.)
Next to its accelerated growth, the
most dramatic change now happening
to the world's population is its rapid
urbanization. Throughout history and
until fairly recently, most of the people
have resided in rural places. Now
already in some regions, and soon in
most others, the majority of the popu¬
lation will be urban.
The trend seems irreversible at this
time, and profound changes in modes
of living, thinking and feeling are
associated with it. One may be
tempted to foresee a future world that
will be totally urban. Nevertheless
even this phenomenon can reach an
eventual limit. Perhaps in the more
distant future the settlement pattern
will crystallize in new forms for which
our present concepts furnish no mean¬
ingful description.
Little more than one-fifth of the
world's population was urban in 1925.
The urban proportion in the world total
now approaches two-fifths, may exceed
one-half by the century's end, and can
rise to two-thirds about fifty years from
now. In North America, Europe,
the Soviet Union and Latin America, it
will then be the overwhelming majority.
It is of interest to note at what time
the urban population has become, or
almost fourfold from 1925 to 197*5
(405 million to 1,585 million) and that
it may again grow almost fourfold from
1975 to 2025 (to 6,029 million). In the
fifty years which have passed, the
urban population nearly doubled in
Europe, grew threefold in North
America and Oceania, fivefold in the
Soviet Union, sixfold in East Asia,
nearly sevenfold in South Asia, and
about eightfold in Latin America and
Africa.
In the fifty years to follow, the urban
population of Europe may grow by
four-fifths, those of North America,
the Soviet Union and Oceania may
more than double, in East Asia the
urban population may grow fourfold,
in Latin America almost fivefold, in
South Asia almost sixfold, and in
Africa eightfold. The figures are con¬
trolled in part by anticipated growth in
total population and in part also by the
eventual exhaustion of the rural popu¬
lation whence migrants originate and
where new towns come into existence.
In 1925 two-fifths of the world's
urban population was still to be found
in Europe. Though it has doubled, at
the present time Europe's urban popu¬
lation is approximately equalled by
those of East Asia and South Asia. In
the future, perhaps one-half of the
world's urban population will be shared
by East and South Asia. Latin America
and Africa may then have larger urban
populations than Europe despite the
continued growth of the latter. (See
table ¿op opposite page.)
In many regions overall population
gains are so massive that, despite an
enormous growth in the size and
number of cities, the rural population
keeps on augmenting. This is no
longer the casé in North America,
Europe and the Soviet Union where the
rural population has passed its peak,
is already decreasing, and may
decrease more decidedly in the
decades to come. (See table bottom
opposite page.)
The long-range projections make it
appear likely that in other parts of the
world the rural population will also,
sooner or later, reach a maximum and
then grow no further. This may occur
by 1985 in East Asia, by the year 2010
in Latin America, by 2020 in Oceania,
and perhaps as late as 2030 in Africa.

in the future, however, are of quite
diverse orders of magnitude. The past
peak populations in the rural localities
of North America, Europe and the
Soviet Union were of the order of 60,
180 and 145 million, respectively. In
Latin America the maximum may be
reached with 172 million, in Africa
with 594 million, in East Asia with
689 million, and in South Asia with
1,732 million. The last-mentioned
figure is some 700 million larger than
the present one and it is difficult to
foresee how such an enlarged rural
population will be productively em¬
ployed.
The worried reader may seek solace
from the fact that the projections
merely result from assumptions maue1
rather arbitrarily. The future is likely
to prove that none of the assumptions
has been quite right. In fact, the
projections discussed so far represent
only a "medium" variant which, in our
present view, is perhaps the most
probable. But the "high and "low"
variants calculated as its companions
are still considered to lie within a
range which cannot be ruled out as
improbable. Outside this scheme of
three plausible variants some other
alternatives have also been computed.
One alternative, namely, the main¬
tenance of fertility levels recently
recorded in each region into an inde¬
finite future, must be ruled out as quite
impossible. If mortality diminishes as
already assumed, but fertility remains
unchanged, the total world population
would reach 7,843 million in 2000, and
it would exceed 17,000 million in 2025,
40,000 million in 2050 and 100,000
million in 2075. Even then it would
continue to grow with breath taking
speed.
Science-fiction may enable us to
envisage some future planet, remote
either in time or space, supporting
100,000 million human beings in health,
assuming that in the interim there have
been carried into effect truly astound¬
ing transformations in technology and
social organization. Perhaps genetic
mutations would be necessary for
adaptation to such a totally altered
environment. The year 2075 is decid¬
edly too early for such cosmic achieve¬
ment. Constant fertility throughout
the next hundred years would certainly
provoke disaster.
But it is equally certain that high
fertility rates cannot be at once
reduced to less than half their present
levels. A projection has, in fact, been
calculated where mortality will decline
as already assumed, but where fertility
is suddenly cut down to net replace¬
ment level beginning with the year
1970. In this projection, owing to the
time needed for the adjustment of age
structure, the world's population would
still rise to 5,796 million by the year
2075, less than one-half of the over
12,000 million figure foreseen in the
"medium" variant.
Coming closer to reality, the crux
of the problem is how to envisage the
timing and speed of those fertility
reductions which must inevitably come
about. There is much pertinent know¬
ledge derived from past trends in at
least some parts of the world, and
from studies of the circumstances
under whose influence such downward
trends have been set into motion.
But, as already said, there exist two
types of factors, some of which can
precipitate fertility decline while others
retard it. The net result, in terms of
actual fertility decrease, depends on
how soon, and how strongly the first
set of factors will prevail over the
second. The reader will appreciate
that our area of uncertainty remains
wide.
We expect that government pro¬
grammes aiming in that direction will
achieve at least some measure of
success. We are also aware of other
well established trends, such as more
widespread education, more frequent
survival of children to adolescence,
increased circulation of mass communi¬
cation media, intensifying urbanization,
and so forth, and these will also play
their part.
It is still useful to ponder the poss¬
ible consequences of a more dismal
assumption concerning mortality. In
fact, during the 1960s progress in the
postponement of death has been less
rapid in most parts of the world than
it had been during the 1950s. One
interesting, though admittedly very
pessimistic (and quite improbable)
assumption to make is that after 1970
mortality decline has been permanently
arrested.
A detailed projection of this type
has not yet been calculated, but it can
be reasonably expected that in the
presently more developed regions
constant mortality at the recent level
would not take away much from pro¬
jected population growth because mor¬
tality is already quite low. In some of
the less developed regions, population
growth will be more significantly slow¬
ed down if, which we do not believe,
health levels should remain as they
now are.
Finally, it remains justifiable to give
thought to the possibility of severe
reversals in the affairs of man, provok¬
ing catastrophic events which exact a
huge loss of lives. There is no deny¬
ing that great tragedy can overtake us
at any moment. But no basis can be
found for estimating either its timing
or its extent.
It is emphasized here that all the
international efforts directed at the
preservation of peace, the assertion of
human rights, the stimulation of econo¬
mic and social progress, the protection
of the environment, and relief measures
in cases of local disaster, are aimed
precisely at the avoidance of any
extensive reversal. As a guide to
responsible action, therefore, we can
only take into account such projections
In which the contemplation of admit¬
tedly possible, cataclysmic break¬
downs plays no part.

people. Removing the lower half of
the income distribution in any country
will raise the average income of the
country as a whole by a purely arith¬
metic process. And logically one
should then carry this to the point at
which one leaves only one man the
richest man to start with. Of course
this is absurd, but this is the kind of
absurdity that the average-income
quality-of-life criterion leads to. Such
absurdities should make the criterion
suspect.
(2) Another implication of an aver¬
age-income criterion is that the birth
rate should be driven down to ridicu¬
lously low levels, and perhaps to zero
births the particular level depending
upon the weight one gives to the future
relative to the present. For example,
if the future is discounted at perhaps
10 per cent per year, the present value
of per-person income into the infinite
future would be maximized if we stop
having babies completely. This is
because it will be a long time before
the' babies begin to produce anything,
though they will be consuming im¬
mediately.
Hence a baby born today lowers the
income of everyone else, on the aver¬
age. Having no babies at all next
year would be good for per-capita
income next year. But no one wants
to go so far with this implication of an
average-income criterion. Hence this
criterion should not be taken as a
basic guide to action.

them. "This position implies a policy
oriented de facto towards a further
decrease in the rate of population
growth."
Canada has not yet considered the
official formulation of an explicit popu¬
lation policy.
Latin America
The picture which can be deduced
from the somewhat limited number of
responses from Latin American coun¬
tries may not fully represent the actual
situation in the whole region.
Five countries, namely, Barbados,
Colombia, the Dominican Republic,
Panama and Trinidad and Tobago have
pursued for some time a policy of
reducing the rate of population growth.
It seems that Mexico may be about to
join this group.
Chile, Peru and Uruguay have adopt¬
ed a neutral position, assuming that
general economic and social develop¬
ment as such will eventually dispose
of the population problem. In Chile
and Uruguay the rate of growth has
been falling for some time and is now
comparatively low. In Peru the govern¬
ment does not interfere with existing
private family planning.
Asia
The majority of Asian countries have
recognized the necessity of implement¬
ing an active population policy. This
analysis is hased on responses from
23 Asian countries, not including China.
Among the countries which have
replied to the U.N. Inquiry the majority
entertain a clear policy aimed towards
an abatement of population growth.
India is continuing its present policy
with this aim in view. Iran expects
to bring down its annual population
growth to about 1 per cent within 20
years. Japan is striving to attain a
stationary population. The objective
of the Laotian Government is to reduce
the present 2.4 per cent rate to 1.2 per
cent by the year 2000.
In Pakistan a national slogan, "fewer
and healthier children", is being widely
publicized. In Nepal the present popu
lation policy is to reduce the rate of
growth. In the Philippines it is estimat¬
ed that a variety of measures will bring
the birth rate down from 43.2 per
thousand in 1970 to 34.8 per thousand
in 1980. In Singapore the- ultimate
objective is a zero population growth.
In Sri Lanka (Ceylon), although no pre¬
cise target is given, it is expected that
family planning will have to be more
vigorously pursued.
Thailand aims to reduce the popula¬
tion growth rate from over 3 per cent
to about 2.5 per cent by 1976. The
Turkish Government is taking meas¬
ures to keep the population under 65
million by the year 1995. The Republic
of Viet-Nam aims to reduce its present
3.0 per cent population growth rate.
The positions of the Governments of
Bahrain, Kuwait, Jordan and the Syrian
Arab Republic are not explicitly stated,
but their replies suggest that in the
future they will wish to seek a slower
rate of population growth.
The policy of the Government of
Iraq is to sustain up until 1980 the
present rate of fertility and to lower
the rate of mortality, and that of the
Government of the Khmer Republic
appears to be aimed towards an
accelerated growth.
Europe and
the Soviet Union
Twenty-one countries (including the
U.S.S.R.) responded to the U.N.
Inquiry. Most of the European coun¬
tries have moderate or low rates of
population growth. Accordingly their
population policies are concerned to a
much smaller degree with growth prob¬
lems than are those in other continents.
At the forefront of European interest
are issues of urban congestion, hous¬
ing, aging, general welfare, ecology
etc., and in some cases also the prob¬
lem of depopulation.
No country in this region has indi¬
cated an explicit policy of reducing the
rate of population growth.
The Federal Republic of Germany
and the Netherlands show some con
cern with the pressures that could
result from further increases in the
total number of inhabitants in their
respective countries.
In the following countries the govern¬
ments do not interfere directly with
demographic processes: Austria, Den¬
mark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, the
Ukrainian S.S.R., the Soviet Union and
Yugoslavia.
Five European countries indicate that
their policies are in favour of an
increase in their population. These are
Czechoslovakia, France, Greece, Hun¬
gary and Romania. The position of
Poland is not clearly determined, al¬
though there is concern about the
possible impact of low rates of popula¬
tion growth on future development.
Oceania
Australia and New Zealand have no
specific demographic targets, but both
countries are interested in maintaining
a controlled rate of population growth
through their policies of immigration.
The policy of Fiji is for a reduction of
population growth.
In conclusion:
It seems warranted to state that
governments on the Asian continent,
which comprises half of mankind, have
recognized that continued population
growth can be a burden on the eco¬
nomy, and they are increasing their
efforts to achieve a rate of growth
which will render the task of economic
and social development more mana¬
geable.
Although some changes in popula¬
tion policies in Africa and Latin Ame¬
rica are taking place, differences of
national approach among countries in
these regions are quite apparent. Most
of Europe, North America and Oceania
have already achieved low rates of
population growth. The moderate
acceleration of growth rates which are
the targets of some European countries
will probably be counteracted by
further declines in other countries, so
that an even lower rate of population
growth is apt to result in these regions
combined.

nes the relationship between science-tech¬

how specialists in each field stimulate and
influence their opposite numbers. Contri¬
butors to this issue, both artists and
technicians, try to identify the role of the
artist as innovator and human being in a
world, whether "developed" or "develop¬
ing", dominated by ceaseless technical
change; they describe some of the art forms
born of evolutionary science and techno¬
logy. See Impact (no. 1, January-March
1974).
Plant invaders
The invasion of water supply systems by
aquatic plants has become a world-wide
problem calling for international scientific
investigation according to scientists at a
recent Unesco meeting on environmental
engineering, in Paris. Over 30 types of
algae cause increasingly severe taste and
odour problems and some are even toxic
to humans and cattle. A single square
kilometre of water hyacinth can expand to
1,000 sq. km. in about a month. This plant
clogs recreational waters, irrigation ditches,
and canals in the U.S. and is spreading
world wide.
'Seed' for new
Canadian education
The Canadian Province of Ontario is
experimenting with a number of " free
schools ", in which students plan their own
programmes and use the entire community
as a classroom. The first of these secon¬
dary schools, called SEED for " Shared
Experience, Exploration and Discovery ",
is described in a brochure, " Changes in
Secondary Education and Their Implica¬
tions for Continuing Education in Canada ",
published by Unesco and the International
Bureau of Education (IBE). (Copies avail¬
able from the Unesco Office of Publica¬
tions, Place de Fontenoy, Paris.)
Museums in Latin
America
Unesco's quarterly " Museum " devotes
a recent issue to the role of museums in
today's Latin America *. Richly illustrated,
it discusses the part played by museums
not only in the cultural field but also in
rural development, urbanization, technology,
education and everyday life.

tion: $10 or £3, single copy $3 or 90p.
Tasteless fish protein
About 1,000 tons of fish protein will be
used by Sweden this year to enrich
30,000 tons of wheat products for World
Food Programme aid projects in dev¬
eloping countries. Odourless and tasteless,
the fish protein was developed in Sweden.
It increases the protein content of flour
from six to 15 per cent, giving it the
same biological value as pure casein, the
main protein of clotted milk and cheese.
Mass media
and family planning
The first Unesco regional course to
show broadcasters how to prepare effec¬
tive programmes on family planning and
its implications for economic and social
development was recently organized by
the National Broadcasting Training Centre
at Kuala-Lumpur (Malaysia). It was attend¬
ed by radio producers and family planning
specialists from 13 Asian countries. Simi¬
lar courses are planned for the Arab
states and for Africa during 1974.
Afro-Brazilian museum
Brazil is to launch a programme of cultu¬
ral co-operation with Africa, and is setting
up an " Afro-Brazilian Museum " and
research centre at Salvador de Bahia.
The decision to create the first museum
devoted entirely to relations between the
cultures of Africa and tropical America
was taken following a study of Brazil's
museums by two Unesco experts, Jean
Faviére and Jean Gabus.
'All change
to bikes'
A campaign for the bicycle, "All Change
to Bikes", is being launched in the U.K.
Campaign objectives include: networks
of cycle priority routes in cities, adequate
provision for cyclists in new developments
and use of bridleways, towpaths and small
lanes for cross-country routes. "The bicy¬
cle is quiet, odourless and economic in
terms of raw materials", say the organizers.
Flashes...
The U.S.A. has more museums than any
other country (2,889) reports the latest
edition of Unesco's Statistical Year Book.
U.S.S.R. comes second with 1,173 museums
followed by Japan (1,108), U.K. (900) and
France (805).
Unesco's fund to save the temples of
Philae, on the Nile, has now received over
£657,000 raised by last year's exhibition
of treasures from the tomb of the Egyptian
pharaoh Tutankhamun, at the British Mu¬
seum, London.
Mr. Francis Blanchard, of France, has
become Director-General of the Internatio¬
nal Labour Office in Geneva.
Saudi Arabia is to contribute 50 million
dollars to the U.N. World Food Programme
during 1974-1975.
600,000 copies of the children's supple¬
ment on Copernicus in the April 1973
issue of the "Unesco Courier" are to be
published in Argentina for distribution to
schoolchildren and students.
A World Bank loan of $25 million will
enable Ireland to provide 20,000 new
places' particularly for technical education,
in schools, training centres and colleges.
Over 25,000 persons visited Unesco's
Paris headquarters in 1973 a 25 per cent
increase compared with 1972.

Letters to the Editor
PORTUGUESE AFRICA
Sir,
Bravo for your issue, " 'Portuguese'
Africa: the Struggle for Independence"
(November 1973). It raises the real
problems of the modern world.
Mme Lefranc
Nice, France
Sir,
Ginette Fontaine-Eboué says that
Unesco would like to see peace restor¬
ed in Portuguese Africa (your Novem¬
ber 1973 issue), and I have no doubt
that the inhabitants would as well. The
only people who do not appear to want
peace are the terrorists who illegally
enter the territory of a member of the
U.N. in order to cause as much terror
as possible, e.g. by laying mines, kid¬
nappings, etc. If they withdrew, the
Portuguese would have no-one to fight
(they do not want anyone to fight) and
peace would be restored. Yet the U.N.,
the World Council of Churches and
other supposedly humanitarian organi¬
zations consistently give aid to these
terrorists!
E.W. Boadtn
Reading, U.K.
Sir.
Your November 1973 issue was most
impressive. The Portuguese colonia¬
lists trample on human dignity and
instil in the African people a sense of
inferiority so as to bring them to sub¬
mission and servitude. But this will
never happenl World public opinion
sides with the peoples of Africa fighting
for their freedom.
N. Mirsanova

Sir,
Your issue on "Portuguese" Africa is
very well done. We would like 150
copies for use in educational and fund
raising programmes for the liberation
movements.
Dennis G. Adair
Education Director
United Nations Association
Toronto, Canada
Sir,
I believed the information published
by the "Unesco Courier" to be impar¬
tial and honest, objective and true.
Your November 1973 issue, however,
was a great disappointment to me.
You published articles and opinions
about my country's problems and poli¬
tics which are totally one-sided and
sometimes untrue. I respect your poli¬
tical ideas and freedom of mind, but
your unobjective and partial treatment
of the subject shocked me. The items
which make up your issue were collect¬
ed only from the so-called "liberated"
territories. What about the other terri¬
tories? What about the positive action
of Portuguese people in the African
provinces?
Mawa Joäo Ataide
Lisbon, Portugal
Sir,
I read with considerable interest the
excellent articles in your November
1973 issue. The International Student
Movement for the United Nations
(ISMUN) is closely following the pro¬
gress of this struggle, not least in the
newly-proclaimed republic of Guinea-
Bissau.
Jon Alexander
Secretary-General
ISMUN, Geneva, Switzerland
Sir,
We are now using your special issue
on "Portuguese" Africa in our activi¬
ties. It is a very powerful "weapon".
T. Ogawa
Japanese Anti-Apartheid
Committee, Tokyo
Sir,
I believe strongly in decolonization
and the right to self-determination, but
I know little about the lives and the
struggles of the peoples concerned.
The "Unesco Courier" has now bridged
the lamentable omissions of the press
in general.

UNSCIENTIFIC AND UNJUST '
The " Parents' and Teachers' Asso¬
ciation of Lyon " recently organized a
discussion on racism, in which Euro¬
pean, African and Asian teachers and
students took part. In a final statement,
the Association urged that a great effort
be made in all schools and in all
countries to show that " the concept of
racial superiority is unscientific ", and
that such a concept is " unjust and
revolting ".
The Association called for " the right
to education and to participation in
cultural life " to be extended to all
immigrant workers and their families,
" for whom special classes should be
provided where necessary ".

MERRYMAKING
IN NEWFOUNDLAND
Sir,
Your readers may be interested to
hear about this year's celebrations
marking the 25th anniversary of the
Confederation of Newfoundland with
Canada *.
The celebrations began on March 31
at midnight with bonfires and songfests
all over the Province and will continue
throughout the spring and summer. All
Newfoundlanders are being encouraged
to join in as much as they can.
There are three travelling shows :
" Where It's At ", a slide and film
show on a six-image multiscreen,
shows Newfoundlanders at work and
play ; " Celebration Time ", is a combi¬
nation of live and filmed entertainment,
and " Newfoundland Pageant " is a
mixture of old and new. The company
will travel with their own stage and so
can set up virtually anywhere in the
various communities they visit. Their
production will trace Newfoundland's
people back to the visiting Vikings and
Cabot's landing in 1497.
In September, a Fisheries Exhibition
in St. John's will provide events and
competitions for commercial fishermen
as well as the weekend angler, and
demonstrations of fish filleting, packing,
freezing and canning.
Even blueberry pickers will have a
chance to demonstrate their skill during
the Work Skills Festival in the early
part of September, as will farmers and
sheep raisers and turnip growers.
Jane E. Cumings
Toronto, Canada
* Newfoundland became the 10th
province of Canada on March 31, 1949.
The Province comprises the Atlantic
island of Newfoundland and the coast
of Labrador, and has a population of
just over half a million Editor.
LITTLE-KNOWN CELTS
Sir,
Your December issue (" Pakistan,
5,000 Years of Art & Culture ") was
devoted to what is certainly an inter¬
esting civilization, but one which ap¬
pears to have very few links with our
own. The Celtic civilization, for ins¬
tance, is no better known but it is very
much closer to us.
Why not devote an issue to the Celtic
civilization, which among other things
gave us soap and the barrel and whose
people founded an empire in Europe
before that of the Romans.
Laurent David
Bourg-Achard, France
' DOLDRUMS ' AND
' HORSE LATITUDES '
Sir,
Your special issue on world meteoro¬
logy (August-September 1973) was
useful and interesting. May I however,
point out a minor error in " A Short
Guide to Weather-Speak " (on page 41).
You are right in saying that the area
of equatorial calms (between the two
belts of trade winds) is known as the
"doldrums", but it is wrong to say that
English mariners in the days of sail
called it the " horse latitudes ".
The name " horse latitudes " is pro¬
perly applied to the areas of tropical
calms in the neighbourhood of the Tro¬
pics of Cancer and Capricorn (respec¬
tively 30-33 degrees north and south
of the Equator), and particularly to the
part of the northern belt over Atlantic.
Otherwise, as a specialist in meteoro¬
logy, may I say that your issue is a fine
achievement.

An illustrated inventory
of famous dismembered
works of art

Unesco
Unesco 1974
Paperbound: 54 F Clothbound : 70 F
223 pages
Just published by Unesco
An illustrated inventory of
famous dismembered works of art
European painting
Leading European art specialists and historians
retrace the stories of some famous masterpieces of
Italian, Flemish, French, Spanish, German and Russian
painting which have been dismembered and the
fragments dispersed in different countries.
This outstanding Unesco book, richly illustrated
with 340 reproductions and many drawings, discusses
a complex international problem: how Europe's dis¬
membered works of art have been and could be
restored to their original unity.
A special chapter deals with some celebrated
European illuminated manuscripts and a concluding
study is devoted to French sculpted tombs that have
suffered dismemberment.
