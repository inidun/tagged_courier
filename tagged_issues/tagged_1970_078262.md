Ancestor figure
This two-headed figure is
a unique example of the
rare stone carvings of
Hawaii. Forty centimetres
(16 in.) high, it is wrought
from the dark basalt rock
found in Pacific islands
of volcanic origin. The
statuette is thought to
represent an ancestor
figure of the Hawaiian
people, "Te-ari' i-tino-nua'
(the woman with two
bodies), traditionally
believed to have
accompanied the first
inhabitant of Hawaii
on his epic voyage from
Tahiti, over 2,000 miles
away. The adventures of
the voyage are recounted
in a long Hawaiian poem.
The pendant worn by
the figure, made of walrus
tusk and suspended by a
loop woven from human
hair, is a miniature
version of a traditional
Polynesian ornament.

### NON-ARTICLE-TEXT

Homo sapiens, it would seem, is man's deadliest enemy. No
vertebrate, not even the most ferocious of the carnivores,
habitually kills members of its own specieswith two
exceptions... rats and men. Can it be that man is no better
than the rat? That, as Konrad Lorenz and a number of his
followers maintain, man is by instinct an aggressive creature,
a born killer, and that it is this innate propensity to violence
that accounts for individual and group aggression in man ?
Last May, Unesco brought together at its headquarters in
Paris a group of distinguished biologists, zoologists and
other scientists from more than a dozen countries to face
this question. Their answer: a unanimous and resounding
"No!" Man is no killer by nature. Man does not possess an
"aggressive instinct." What went on during this debate
and some of the startling conclusions of recent scientific
research in the field are the subject of the first part of this
issue.
But there is another domain where the depredations ofman
have reached the hot danger point: the aggression of
technological, industrial and urban man against his natural
environment, against that thin layer of our planet that has
come to be known as the Biosphere. But here too man has
the answer within himself. For if we so will it, by our
single and Joint acts, there is still time to save our planet
and life upon it from irreparable ruin.

### 56886: Instinct or learned misbehaviour?

«
I
S man chained to the wheel of instinct,
condemned to fight tooth and nail, rocket and bomb until the end (easily
foreseeable, if this is so) of his stay on earth? Or can his brain be taught
to modify the violent behaviour that he needed as a hunting animal in a
now-forgotten world?
The answer to the first question is No; to the second a hesitant qualified
Yes. The questions and their answers came recently at one of the most
unusual conferences that Unesco has ever held. Its purpose was to learn
how far science has got towards understanding human aggressiveness
and along what lines of research it should strike out in the future.
The conference was unusual in that
it bore so little resemblance to a
formal conference. At times, it was
a conversation; at other times, a
philosophical dialogue. . It took on a
life of its own, a rhythmic pace of give-
and-take where any person at any
time could be expected to come up
with the unexpected. Those fortunate
enough to watch it could not help but
tell themselves that such an event gets
right to the raison d'être of an organi¬
zation like Unesco.
Eighteen scientists from fourteen
countries spent a week together
in one of Unesco's conference rooms.
They talked about how to achieve
peace of mind and, subsequently,
the peace of nations on a site
that represented a glimmer of hope
in itself. As one of them remarked,
Unesco coexists peacefully with the
French Ecole Militaire across the way
and it occupies land that once housed
a cavalry barracks.
Their meeting was international,
intercultural, interdisciplinary. They
talked of mice and men, of how both
behave under stress such as the strain
of overcrowding. They talked of
violent crime among new migrants to
Baghdad, of police-stoning by students
in Berkeley. They could speak at
first hand of life on an Indonesian is¬
land, in an African valley peopled by
chimpanzees, in the quiet old city of
Budapest, in the turmoil of New York.
They could talk of correcting mis¬
behaviour in a child by spanking it,
in a monkey by transmitting a signal
to a radio set implanted in its brain.
The men and the one woman at this
meeting were of bents so different and
interests so diverse that none was
preaching to the converted, yet all
were close enough to find common
ground for discussion.

### 56886: Instinct or learned misbehaviour?

UNDERSTANDING MAN'S AGGRESSIVENESS (Continued)
The first matter to discuss and settle
was the biological basis of aggres¬
siveness. If it was innate, then not
much could be done about it, least of
all by an international meeting. The
view that aggressiveness is not only
an instinct in man but that it is a good
one because it makes the world go
round has been put forth in popular
writings that have acquired a huge
following.
Even prime ministers these days
talk of the "territorial imperative",
one scientist observed sadly, as
he expressed the wish that biologists
who go more deeply into the behaviour
of man and animals could write more
clearly.
The consensus of the meeting was
that aggressiveness is not instinctive.
Ht may once have been useful, but in
circumstances far different than those
we experience today. On this issue,,
the most outspoken member of the
meeting was Dr. Robert A. Hinde,
director of animal behaviour study at
the University of Cambridge, England.
He attacked the notion that aggressive
behaviour is "valuable" for the survival
of man as a species.
"Man's cultural evolution takes place
today in circumstances quite different
from those of natural selection," said
Dr. Hinde. "Is it the most aggressive
individuals that our society wishes to
perpetuate? Do we think that there
is a correlation between strength and
wisdom in man? It is certainly absent
in monkeys...
"It has also been said that aggress¬
iveness is needed ' to establish a
hierarchical order in society. In this
view, the presence of untouchables is
needed as a release for aggress¬
iveness. But has anyone asked the
untouchables about this?"
A number of subtle distinctions had
to be drawn, some along semantic
lines. Aggressiveness may not be an
"instinct", agreed Dr. Sherwood
Washburn, professor of anthropology
at the University of California at
Berkeley, but it is very readily learnt.
"Give a boy a rifle and he'll go out and
hunt," he remarked. "This is built
into us. Crowds are violent, armies
are violent. Look at the Congo, look
at Vietnam. It is easy for man
to be extremely violent." Dr. Ali
Kemal, professor of psychiatry at the
University of Mustansiriah in Baghdad,
disagreed: "I cannot agree that ag¬
gressiveness is learnt; it's as old as
original sin."
On this issue, as on a number of
others, the chairman of the meeting;
Dr. David Hamburg, head of the
psychiatry department of the Stanford
University School of Medicine, in
California, was able to bring apparently
conflicting views together without
necessarily watering them down to
a' lowest common denominator.
Dr. Hamburg, a thoughtful man who
could make very incisive statements
very unaggressively, wondered aloud
if much of man's biological equip¬
ment and the violent behaviour that
it generates is not obsolete.
Several other speakers, beginning
with Prof. Richard Hoggart, Unesco
Assistant Director-General for Social
Sciences, Human Sciences and
Culture, who opened the meeting,
pointed out that the world has changed,
but man has not. He has not yet had
time to evolve physically from man the
hunter; yet hunting as a way of life
has vanished from the face of the
earth except in a few remote pockets.
Dr. Hamburg put a time scale on this
change to show how human evolution
has been unable to keep up with the
change from caveman to cityman.
Mammals appeared on earth 50 mil¬
lion years ago, hominids some
4 million years ago. Our own species
is 40,000 years old, agriculture began
about 8,000 years ago and the
industrial revolution responsible for the
shape of the modern world Is but two
centuries old, "only a moment in
evolutionary time." Small wonder that
man the hunter who needed ten
square miles of elbow-room per capita
according to conclusions based on
distribution of fossil remains has so
much trouble squeezing into factories,
office buildings and cities.
Left, a pitched battle between
police and students, a shot
from a recent American film,
"The Strawberry Statement",
which dramatises the
world-wide problem of
today's conflict between
youth and authority on the
campus.

Tanzania and shows a

2. Should we ape
the chimpanzee?
I F man is not born Instinct¬
ively aggressive, then why does he
get that way? This question was the
crux of the meeting and it was appro¬
ached first from the viewpoint of etho¬
logy, the science of animal behaviour
that seems to fall halfway between the
stools of the social and the natural
sciences. Let's say it's a social
science of non-humans.
The most complete account of how
animals act in their natural surround¬
ings as compared to the artificial en¬
vironment of a zoo or a laboratory
came from Dr. Jane van Lawick-Goodall
who has spent ten years observing
chimpanzees at the Gombe Stream
Research Centre in Tanzania. The
chimps, she remarked, now take no
more notice of her than they would of
a stone, a tree ... or a baboon. She
can watch them from no more than
a room's length away as they run the
gamut of aggressive behaviour. This
takes patience because chimpanzees
can go for days without creating a
single aggressive incident.
The repertory starts with a "low-
intensity threat", a mere jerk of the
head and a little cough, and extends
right up to a big male hunching his
shoulders, bristling his hair, stamping
his feet, drumming on the buttresses
of a tree, brandishing a branch or
throwing stones. It was pointed out
at the meeting that the mild range of
animal threats may correspond to
verbal aggression in humans.
Chimpanzees are masters of the art
of brinkmanship, seldom going to the
point of actual physical violence.
Even when they do, said Dr. van
Lawick-Goodall, they don't seem to
come out with more than a few
scratches or some lost handfuls of
hair. Immediately after a clash that
may see two animals rolling furiously
down a slope, the antagonists are at
peace. The victim can extend its hand,
the aggressor will pat its head, and
then they start to groom each other.
Dr. van Lawick-Goodall said that
she had never seen chimpanzees fight
to the death. Nor has she ever
observed these lower animals form¬
ing groups to make war on each other.
The world that she observes is so
civilized that its ruler rose to the top
without even laying a hand on his
subjects. She has watched the career
of this leader, Mike, since 1964 when
he was somewhat of a chump as a
chimp, the butt of attacks by nearly
all the other adult males. Then he
picked up an empty paraffin can and
began to drag it around. Soon he was
rolling three cans through the area at
full speed, making more noise than
an express train, sending every other
chimpanzee scurrying in frightful flight
to the treetops. Mike has been the-
champ chimp ever since.
Aggressiveness appears in chim¬
panzees first of all if they are attacked.
They rarely fight over food and then
only if a much-liked item is in short
supply. Frustration is another cause
and it leads to redirected aggression:
a young animal will attack an animal
lower down on the dominance scale
if it has been attacked by a higher-

AGGRESSIVENESS (Continued)
ranking member of the group. A male
will attack a female in oestrus if she
does not respond to his courtship.
An individual that is different from the
others will arouse enmity. Such was
the case, Dr. van Lawick-Goodall
remarked, of infants that had lost their
mothers and of one young chimp that
had been stricken with polio and could
not use its legs.
The female of the species is less
aggressive than the male but perhaps
more dangerous after all. Dr. van
Lawick-Goodall explained that male
chimpanzees will fight and immediately
forgive. A female may give way if
attacked by a male, then go up to
another male half an hour later and
convince him to settle the score.
Dr. van Lawick-Goodall remarked:
"It's not fair to say that women do not
play a role in the aggressive side of
society. Throughout history, they have
egged their men on."
Another parallel with human be¬
haviour might be drawn from the way
chimpanzees acted when the experi¬
menters were feeding them. Under
natural conditions, they will take fruit
from a tree quietly, the higher-ranking
animals leaving enough for the others.
Then bananas were introduced into
this Eden. They were kept in locked
boxes; the animals knew that they
could not get them all at once. So at
feeding time, the chimpanzees would
fight.
A dominant animal might corner the
market with fifty bananas in his arms
and with no intention of letting anyone
else get as much as a peel. Some of
the wily youngsters found the screws
that opened the locked boxes. They
would sit blithely covering them with
their feet until the adults went away,
then they got into the banana business
themselves. After a year of these
handouts, the practice was stopped
because it led to too much aggression.
One would expect scientists to have
a great many reservations about
applying lessons learnt from watching
chimpanzees to the behaviour of
human beings. Surprisingly, they did
not. Dr. Washburn stated flatly that
man and the chimpanzee are closer
biochemically than the dog and the fox
or the cat and the lion. From this
standpoint, the gorilla and the chimp
are as different as man and the chimp.
He cited research in Japan and the
United States which shows that, for
example, in the sequence of amino
acids in hemoglobin, there are 52 diffe¬
rences between man and the horse,
two between the chimp and the
gorilla and none between man and
the chimpanzee.
Dr. Washburn predicted that within
the next five years, science will have
produced a "biochemical clock" to date
the separation of the major groups of
primates (among them monkeys, apes
and humans) with an accuracy of about
one million years.

The private life
of the wild
chimpanzee
A remarkable achievement in scientif¬
ic research on animal life In the wild is
that of Dr. Jane van Lawick-Goodall.
a young English woman zoologist. For
the 'past ten years she has lived in the
African forest, studying a colony of
chimpanzees in Tanzania's Gombe Na¬
tional Park on the eastern shore of
Lake Tanganyika. Wild chimpanzees
are" extremely shy, but Dr. van Lawick-
Goodall patiently and doggedly won
their' confidence until she was able to
sit among them and observe details
of their lives never recorded before.
She studied every aspect of their
hierarchy and complex social behaviour
and the tremendous variety of calls
and gestures which serve them as a
language. Her most astonishing discov¬
ery was that chimps make and use
tools. In particular to extract tasty
termites from their mounds. Man has
long been considered the only primate
with a tool-making talent, which has
been a key factor in his evolution.
Dr. van Lawick-Goodall's adventurous
life among the chimps, which she shared
with her husband (who took many of
the photos reproduced on these pages)
has often obliged her to stay out alone
all night to observe chimpanzee sleep¬
ing habits and to crouch for hours
behind a screen of leaves when photo¬
graphing an exceptionally wary animal.
She says she cannot remember the
time when she did not want to go to
Africa to study animals. Her sense of
vocation has produced a unique and
engrossing scientific record of the
private life of the wild chimpanzee,
some startling aspects of which are
presented here.
Left, chimp holding a stone in left
hand prepares to hurl it at
photographer. Chimpanzees
frequently throw objects (well
aimed) during aggressive
encounters with baboons (and
occasionally each other).
Chimpanzees learned to accept
the presence of the zoologist,
Dr. van Lawick-Goodall, among
them, and one, David Greybeard,
became a firm friend, often
popping into camp to visit her.
The Gombe National Park, set aside especially for chimpanzees, spreads across
30 square miles of forested valleys and treeless ridges of Kigoma, Tanzania.
Above, a group of chimps in the park, resting in a tree after feeding on the leaf buds.
The group comprises fully a-ow males and females, juveniles and infants.

THE PRIVATE LIFE
OF THE CHIMPANZEE
(Continued)
Photos right, Mike the chimp was meek and submissive until the day he picked up an
empty kerosene can and found that it made a satisfactorily terrifying noise. He found that, if
he did not win friends, he could at least influence other chimpanzees and send them scurrying
to the safety of the treetops when he went into his "charging display" equipped with one or
more of these clattering cans. Mike has been lording it over his fellow chimps ever since.
Above, Faben a young male,' relies on his mean and moody look to impress his companions
as he charges, lips compressed and shoulders hunched, across a clearing. In captivity
chimpanzees become irritable, bad-tempered creatures, but in the wild they rarely fight or harm
each other. They achieve their ends by virtuoso pantomime displays of aggressiveness.

UNDERSTANDING MAN'S AGGRESSIVENESS (Continued Irom page 8)
Up against the stone wall
Extreme Isolation, like extreme overcrowding,
can give rise to either apathy or sharp
outbursts of violence in both men and
animals. How poignant such neuroses can
become is shown in this pathetic photograph
of a red-haired orang-outang bashing his head
against his cage wall out of deep despair.
Scientists believe that such emotional stresses
can cause physical damage and even death.
Several voices were raised at the
meeting to insist on the importance
of considering man as an animal so
that ethology could be applied to
human situations. Then the problem
was approached from another angle
when Dr. Lionel Tiger, a Canadian
anthropologist now at Rutgers Uni¬
versity in New Jersey, recalled how
men tend to consider wartime enemies
as subhuman.
Much lower down than the primates
on the tree of evolution, mice also
have much to teach us. Dr. Philip
Ropartz, of the Psychophysiology
Laboratory of the Science Faculty at
Strasbourg in France, has done a great
deal of work on the role that smell
plays in transmitting information to
animals and in touching off aggress¬
iveness.
He reminded his listeners that the
human observer cannot ~ hope to
imagine what animals learn from
smell, which is almost their equivalent
of language. Experiments have shown
that dogs can tell from their sense
of smell if their master has been in
the city or the country and even if he
is in a good or a bad mood.
Working with mice, researchers
have found that the males lose their
combativity if their sense of smell is
eliminated by surgery. Aggress¬
iveness was also braked when mice
with normal noses were sprayed with
feminine perfume. Like surgery, It
masked the mouse's sense of smell,
preventing it from distinguishing foes
from friends. "Perfume has been
used by humans since antiquity," said
Dr. Ropartz half-jokingly, "perhaps it
also reduces the 'aggressiveness' that
the human male feels towards the
female."
Dr. Ropartz also remarked that mice
become more violent when they live
in a state of either extreme isolation
or overpopulation. Similar behaviour
has been found in monkeys reared in
isolation or plunged into crowded zoos.
Confined to cages, the animals lower
on the social scale are always in
contact with their dominators. They
constantly eye each other, creating a
vicious circular interaction of threats
generating aggression that generates
more threats. Gang wars have been
known to occur in zoos among animals
that display no such tendencies in the
wild.
Reflecting on these findings, Dr. Ro¬
partz wondered If another vicious
circle did not exist In big cities where
violent crime is on the rise. One
could perhaps say that the violent
criminal produced by crowding Is
isolated in a prison cell, an opposite
extreme that possibly renders him
even more aggressive.
This speculation brought a reaction
from Dr. Miklos Kun, professor of
psychology at Eotvos Lorand College
in Budapest. Throughout the meeting.
Dr. Kun drew on personal experience
in making his comments. Here, he

## [Page 17](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/078262engo.pdf#page=17) 0

told of two patients of his who had
spent more than five years in solitary
confinement.
"They were persons of high moral
standards who had been rejected by
society," he said. "When they were
in prison, they told me, they were
happiest when they could go to
sleep. They had vivid dreams, they
saw many images, they relived their
past. Following their liberation, they
suffered recurrent depressions, but
their aggressiveness did not go up."
Dr. Kun also bridled at some of the
suggestions that Dr. José Delgado
made about the need to plan man
biologically in the future. "I am not
optimistic about planning a new man"
he said. "I am optimistic about plan¬
ning a new world."
D
R. Delgado's ideas were
certainly among those that stirred the
most comment at the meeting. A Span¬
ish born physiologist, he has taken
literally the words that he quoted from
the preamble to Unesco's Constitution:
"Since wars begin in the minds of
men, it is in the minds of men that
the defences of peace must be
constructed." One might say that he
has already started constructing them
in the minds of monkeys.
He first appeared in the public eye
when he stepped into a ring with a
charging bull which he was able to
turn aside not with the flip of a cape
but a flick of a switch. The bull
carried a two-way radio implanted in
its brain so that its behaviour could
be changed by an electrical impulse.
Since then, Dr. Delgado has gone
much farther. He told his listeners
that "in the next five years, we shall
see a revolution in the medical treat¬
ment of aggressive behaviour as
important as the appearance of anti¬
biotics in the treatment of infectious
diseases." The basis for this pre¬
diction, he said, lies in research now
being conducted on the "intracerebral
mechanisms" that govern such be¬
haviour. "We are no longer outsiders
looking on, but insiders investigating
what goes on in the depth of the brain
when a subject feels aggression or
rage."
Starting with animals, Dr. Delgado
has been particularly concerned with
learning what happens inside their
brains when they are free in a near-
normal social environment and not in
a laboratory situation. He told of two
techniques.
The first involves implanting very
fine tubing inside the brain which is
connected to two sacs under the skin.
This enables the scientist to inject
drugs into the brain that can serve
to block the functions of specific parts,
a substitute for surgery in treating
certain disorders. Labelled substances
can also be introduced into the animal's
brain and later analyzed to see if
"neurochemical structures differ in
different behaviour" which they do.
The second technique is the "stimo-
ceiver" a two-way radio which is
both a "stimulator" and a "receiver".
As many as 3,000 different points in
the brain of a monkey have been
studied by this method.
In its latest form, the "stimoceiver"
has been hooked up to a computer to
monitor the behaviour of a colony of
chimpanzees on an artificial island
at Holloman, New Mexico, in the
western United States. Their spon¬
taneous activities send signals that
are analyzed and recognized by the
computer. In the event of a special
form of behaviour aggression, for
instance the computer triggers sti¬
mulation to a different part of the
brain to eliminate such behaviour.
"In this way the brain learns to modify
its own activity," Dr. Delgado
explained.
He went on to report on his work
with six human patients who have had
"stimoceivers" planted in their heads.
"If a person is behaving anti-socially,"
he explained, "there are chemical and
electrical mechanisms that we can
identify and modify."
Needless to say, this work brought
some strong comments from his
colleagues at the Paris meeting.
Dr. Hector M. Capello, head of the
department of social psychology at the
National University of Mexico, put their
fears into focus when he remarked:
"It is plausible to control behaviour by
these methods, but it is not plausible
that these methods can determine what
sort of behaviour should be controlled."
Dr. Delgado was not at all taken
aback for he must be well accustomed
by now to such criticism that, in some
cases, can go so far as to hint that
he is creating an Orwellian world of
"1984". He replied, first, that he had
begun to introduce electrodes into
brains because of his own reluctance
to use lobotomy [severing nerve fibres
in the brain], a technique that produces
irreversible change, in treating such
disorders as Parkinson's disease,
epilepsy or intractable pain.
"Is it dangerous to go on with this
work before we have much more
thorough knowledge?" Dr. Delgado
asked, then answered: "Our patients
cannot wait. If a man is in intractable
pain, one cannot wait ten years before
treating him."
Then he reassured Dr. Capello and
some of his other critics. "This tech¬
nique cannot be used to control hu¬
man behaviour. It is, first, a medical
tool for research and therapy and,
secondly, a new approach to learn¬
ing what man really is inside his brain.
I certainly do not claim that we are
going to start implanting electrodes
into the brains of our children and
politicians to change their behaviour."
Dr. Delgado showed colour slides
of his experiments that demonstrated
how the stimoceiver can make a
monkey walk, then run. One set of
slides brought the answer to the dream
of the timid soul who quakes before
crossing the threshold of his boss's
office.
A timid monkey had been placed in
the same cage with a dominant animal
equipped with a stimoceiver. In the
cage, too, was a lever that sent a signal
into the boss's brain, changing him
from a lion to lamb. The timid soul
soon learned how to work the lever
and the results were startling. One
slide showed the "top dog" (that is,
the top monkey) making the "under
dog" miserable, the next showed the
boss cowering after the magic button
had been pressed.
Dr. Delgado is convinced that the
brain learns aggressiveness. "Is there
a killing instinct in man ? No, man
is totally shaped by culture. The
difference between man and the
animals is that his brain is so immature
at birth that, in the absence of sensory
input, his mind cannot work. His
genes are only modulators, the brain's
source of information is cultural, not
genetic."
From this premise, he went on to
advocate education of the child aimed
at "mentalization" rather than mechani¬
zation of society. "We are now at
a crucial moment in civilization. Nature
once controlled man, man now controls
nature, soon we can establish intelli¬
gent control of man. We can correct
the imbalance between the material
powers of man and his mental direction
for we are now as wild as we were
many centuries ago."
T,
HE source of aggressive¬
ness was taken up from still another
angle by Dr. David Hamburg, the
chairman of the meeting. He reported
on research that has already linked
the presence of abnormally high
amounts of testosterone, the male sex
hormone, in mothers to aggressiveness
in children.
While there is not enough knowledge
at present to enable these findings to
be applied practically, Dr. Hamburg
foresaw that "decades from now", the
physician and his patient might choose
therapeutic abortion to prevent the
birth of an "extremely aggressive
individual", a potential Hitler or
Genghis Khan.
Presence of the male sex hormone
at a somewhat lower level could lead
in this same distant future to treatment
of the pregnant mother with substances
to counteract the effects of male hor- -i
mones. Such substances could be I /
administered just as fluoride is added
to drinking water to prevent dental
caries.

UNDERSTANDING MAN'S
AGGRESSIVENESS (Continued)
Dr. Hamburg remarked that political
problems no doubt would arise as they
have with fluoridation. Nations would
not wish to lose the qualities of self-
assertion, vigour and determination
that many feel are linked to an
aggressive personality. Therefore,
Dr. Hamburg said, biochemical treat¬
ment of high-risk aggressiveness
"would probably require a system of
international agreements an idea that
is almost science fiction today."
Here it might be appropriate to
mention a theory referred to at the
meeting by Dr. Lionel Tiger. He is
convinced that "corporate aggress¬
iveness" such as war is a male
function. Discounting tales of the
Amazons, Dr. Tiger said he has been
unable to find a well-documented case
of a culture where women were the
warriors or the hunters of large
animals. War is for men only, it's not
a universally human activity. As for
female aggressiveness, he maintained
that it is not "corporate".
Dr. Capello observed that the meek¬
ness of women in Latin American
cultures may not lie in their hormones
as much as in the fact that they have
been trained "to express a reduced
motor response".
Dr. Hamburg explained that labor¬
atory work with animals shows that
an abnormally high amount of male
sex hormone seems to have the
greatest effect at an early age. It
makes it easier for the subject to
"learn" aggression and to learn it for
good even when its hormonal balance
goes back to normal.
T
18
HIS brought the meeting
to a theme that it seldom left: educa¬
tion. Experiments cited by Dr. Ham¬
burg with monkeys showed that very
young animals exposed to threatening
images for only a short time will react
to them six months later. Immediately,
a correlation with television comes to
mind. It is estimated that, in a
country such as the United States,
children spend as much time in front
of the TV set as they do in school.
In fact, before they start going to
classes at the age of six, television is
the biggest factor in their education.
As a school of violence, it can be
very effective. Surveys in the United
States of programmes offered by the
three major networks have shown,
Dr. Hamburg said, that a murder
occurs once an hour on the screen,
and once every half an hour during
peak viewing time, the early evening
hours. Every eight minutes, there is
a violent incident to be watched. To
make matters worse, Dr. Hamburg
went on, this violence is "sanitized".
There is no blood, there is no un¬
pleasantness. It is shown as a neat
way to solve problems.
VISIONS OF OUR TIME
The arresting works of Spanish painter luan Gegpves are an indictment of violence
in all its forms, from oppression and brutality to war, murder and the senseless
destruction of living things at the hand of man. His variations on these themes
denounce man's inhumanity to man and his increasing capacity for self-destruction.
In some paintings, Genoves shows men hunted down by war machines (top
right, framed in the sights of a weapon, terrified crowds seek vainly to escape);
in others (right) he depicts them fleeing from some nameless threat. In the
chilling six-scene painting above, two tiny figures run helplessly across a featureless
desert but are finally cut down. Soon the footprints of the assassins and then
the bodies of the victims are effaced. Murder, without leaving a trace, has
been committed. The grey and black colours of Genoves' paintings and their
slightly blurred effect recall scenes from newspaper and newsreel photographs and
on-the-scene television coverage. But with their anonymous figures and no
identification of time or place the paintings speak in the present tense. Their
message is that helpless, faceless victims, individual figures or scurrying masses
(see also front cover) are being harassed and hounded down here and now.
Works by Juan Genoves. born in Valencia, Spain, 40 years ago, are displayed in
galleries of North and South America, Africa and Europe. An exhibition of his
works in London was the occasion for the shooting of a film, "A Test of Violence",
in which live action and special effects gave another dimension to Genoves'
paintings on the screen.

HAT can education do in
the face of the barrage of violence
that comes via the TV screen? In
Dr. Sherwood Washburn's opinion,
it is not doing very much. An out¬
spoken man who has had ample
opportunity to study violent behaviour
by young males outside the windows
of his university office at Berkeley,
California, Dr. Washburn declared:
"Animal behaviour studies show that
early environment is tremendously
important. Yet our education system
is the worst possible system. It
delays the start of education much
too long. Then it uses discipline
rather than play. It would be hard
to devise a worse system for educating
human beings. It is at the root of
many of our problems of aggres¬
siveness."
He gave equally short shrift to the
system of higher education that has
stirred such widespread student protest
in the United States and elsewhere.
"The trouble with universities is that
they are housing people who don't
want to be there," he said.
"Students come to universities
because they want a certificate for a
job, they want to find a mate or
because their parents are compens¬
ating for having treated them badly
in childhood. So students rebel in
universities because, perhaps, they
have no choice but to go there."
This tendency seemed to have a
parallel In a quite different society,
that of Baghdad. Crimes of violence
among students there, Dr. Kemal
noted, are highest in the case of
students whose parents live in the city
itself. His explanation was that
students who come from outside the
city have more purpose and less luxury
in their lives.
Soon, it became obvious at the
meeting that there were similarities
between two apparently unlinked
examples of modern aggressive be
haviour: student protests and violent
crime in the cities. Both might be
correlated to some extent with over¬
population. The big university of
today, the so-called multiversity, is a
city. Dr. Hamburg observed that the
earliest known city was Ur in the Near
East. Archaelogists have estimated
its population at 40,000 just half the
enrolment of the University of Cali¬
fornia.
The mention of urban violence
opened a Pandora's box that the
meeting never really closed because
no one yet knows how. There was
even disagreement over whether cities
are more violent than they used to be.
Dr. Tiger said they aren't and claimed
that high crime rates now exist simply
because many incidents ignored in the
past are reported today, particularly
when they involve more prosperous
citizens.
Dr. John Gunn, a British forensic
psychiatrist who was at the meeting
as an observer, warned of the danger
of using crude crime statistics to reach
precise scientific conclusions. He
also added a question mark to findings
by ethologists that animals are most
aggressive of all to strangers. Humans,
he reminded the experts, are even
more aggressive to their kin and there
is nothing that policemen dread more
than being called to intervene in a
violent family quarrel.
In the developing world, the problem
takes on a different cast. Violent
crime in Baghdad, Dr. Kemal pointed
out, is highest among new migrants
from rural areas who make up half the
city's population of two million.
Among the newcomers, the crime rate
is lowest for those who are living
in neighbourhoods with other city
dwellers rather than in settlements
composed mainly of migrants.
The same story was told by Dr.
Shib K. Mitra of the psychology depart¬
ment of the University College of
Science in Calcutta. Crime is up In
his city, too, and he attributed this to
the anonymity of its crowds. "In a
big city, a person from a village loses
his niche. These are the people that
become lost souls."
One reason why they do was ad¬
vanced by Dr. D. B. Lubis of the psy¬
chiatry department of the Faculty of
Medicine at the University of Indonesia.
He remarked that, in a country like his,
the big city is a centre of Western
culture. When the farmer pulls up
stakes and moves to Jakarta, he is not
only going from the country to the city
but to an entirely new culture as well.
This does not only happen to
country people. Cities today are
changing so fast that even their native
sons are left bewildered and disorient¬
ed. Dr. Delgado told of the urban
renewal programme that has been car¬
ried out in New Haven, the home of
Yale University. "The city is now
beautiful and modern but I feel as if
my personal identity is lost. I don't
see colourful gypsies in the street any
more, I don't see the old Negro church
with its piano banging. My whole
history has been stolen."
^B^r F course, there are cities'
and cities. Dr. Kun stuck to his guns to
defend his beloved Budapest where, he
said, the rate of violent crime is
much lower than in remote rural vil¬
lages of Hungary. Dr. Hamburg then
suggested that some research on the
optimum size of cities could be very
useful. He observed that we are as
ill-adapted to the urban as we are to
the industrial civilization. No society
was urbanized before 1800 when only
2.2 per cent of Europe's population
was living in cities. Even as recently
as 1900, only one country, Great
Britain, could have been called urban¬
ized. "We have gone from a situation

Nobody regularly reading a
newspaper or watching television
in Europe or North America nesds
to remind himself of the place of
violence in modern society the
media do that for him daily.
Equally, nobody working in the
media can be unaware of a growing
suspicion that the media might be in
part responsible for the violence
they portray there have been
enough commissions of enquiry
and letters from the public to
make that clear. But suspicion is
not so far based on any generally
applicable scientific findings and
there is deadlock between those
who accuse the media of creating a
demand through their supply of
violence and those who cry
"censorship" and warn that the
media must not be made a
scapegoat for conditions society is
unable or unwilling to do anything
about. As this issue of the "Unesco
Courier" went to press, Unesco
was attempting to review the
present state of knowledge on this
problem and to seek practical
proposals for action through a
symposium on "The Impact of
Violence in the Mass Media" at
its Paris headquarters. Participants
from 20 countries will tackle
such fundamental questions as the
definition of violence, whether it
can be said to be increasing and
whether attitudes have changed
towards it, as well as exploring the
difference in impact between the
message on the screen, the printed
page and in the comic strip, the
varying effects of violence in fiction
and news and the responsibility
of the mass media.

UNDERSTANDING MAN'S AGGRESSIVENESS (Continued)
of no one In cities to the present trend
of everyone in cities."
Some work has already been done to
try to determine if big cities really
make humans behave inhumanly. Dr.
Philip Zimbardo, a Stanford University
researcher, bought two cars. He left
each out in the street for nearly three
days with its hood open and its licence
plates removed, one in front of Stan¬
ford at Palo Alto, California, and the
other next to New York University in
lower Manhattan.
At Palo Alto, a town of about 50,000,
nothing happened to the car. When a
rainstorm broke, some kind passers-
by pushed it under cover. In New
York, Dr. Zimbardo's watchers found,
the car was in the street no more than
seven minutes before it was damaged.
By the end of the experiment, it was
nothing but a stripped and battered
hulk. Most of the damage had been
done in daylight and by well-dressed
members of the white middle class.
The explanation can be found in the
anonymity of the big city. The New
Yorkers who damaged the car felt
that they did not know the owner and
that they would never see any of the
other passers-by again.
In another experiment mentioned
by Dr. Hamburg, four students rang
peoples' doorbells to ask if they could
use the phone. They conducted their
test in New York and in a town of
60,000 nearby. Their chances of ent¬
ering an apartment were five times
higher in the small town. In New
York 75 per cent of the people whose
bells they rang shouted through closed
doors or peered through peepholes.
In the small town, 75 per cent opened
their doors.
"We must remember that cities do
crowd strangers," Dr. Hamburg re¬
marked. "Every day, people come into
contact with strangers whom they will
never see again and with whom they
compete for a short supply of every¬
thing from parking spaces to sexual
partners."
How and why these findings by
ethologists, anthropologists, psycholo¬
gists all representatives of the na¬
tural sciences can be applied to the
actual world was the concern of Dr.
Nicolas Kovalsky from the U.S.S.R.,
deputy-director of the Institute of the
International Labour Movement, in
Moscow. Dr. Kovalsky wanted more
emphasis on the social factors behind
aggressiveness which he divided into
three categories, respectively involving
individuals, national societies and the
international world. He warned, too,
about the dangers of being too biolog¬
ical in one's approach to the problem.

I T was Dr. Ole Holsti, pro¬
fessor of political science at the
University of British Columbia in
Vancouver, who provided a hinge,
between the social and the natural
sciences. He reported on the work
he has done on subjects under stress,
not monkeys or mice but human beings,
including statesmen in historical situa¬
tions. The son of a Finnish official of
the League of Nations, Holsti was born
in Geneva and now works in Canada
almost a one-man international rela¬
tions institute.
He Is interested in finding out what
happens to people under stress when
they have to make decisions that
could lead to the ultimate human
aggressive act: war. He first stated
that there is a biological basis for what
statesmen do in these situations. Hu¬
man beings do not have an infinite
capacity for processing information.
They can only juggle so many things in
their minds at the same time about
seven, give or take two either way.
This means they make mistakes
under pressure.
Dr. Holsti pointed out that a phys¬
ician is considered extraordinary if he
can cure 80 or 90 per cent of his
patients, but such a record is not
nearly good enough for politicians
trying to avoid war in the age of the
nuclear missile. According to current
findings, war is not a pathological
situation created by a Hitler. Irrational
decisions can also be made by normal
individuals in times of stress.
Some stress is a good thing and, at
moderate levels, it can improve per¬
formance. Dr. Holsti cited a hypothe¬
tical emergency: a city is likely to be
hit by a major flood and its citizens
must fill and stack sandbags to protect
it. This is a simple task and, under
stress, people can actually do physical
labour much longer without tiring.
But different skills are needed to
make decisions during a crisis. Experi¬
ments show that the level of these
skills drops in such a situation. Under
stress, subjects tend to see situations
as black and white, never distinguish¬
ing greys. They display "deterioration
of verbal performance, increased rate
of error, diminished tolerance for
ambiguity, loss of abstract ability and
disorientation of visual-motor co-ordin¬
ation." As Dr. Holsti read this list,
some of his listeners wondered
whether people in such a condition
should be allowed to drive a car, let
alone steer a ship of state.
The worst stress of all is time. The

statesman is under pressure to be the
first to mobilize, or not to be beaten
to the draw when the other fellow
has a nuclear missile in his holster.
It makes no difference whether the
danger is real or not. "If he believes
that something Is true, then this is
more important than if it is true."
In the summer of 1914 when local
crises led to the First World War,
statesmen felt they had to be the first
to mobilize. Between French and
German mobilization, there was only
a difference of five minutes. No time
was available to make alternative
choices and, according to Dr. Holsti,
great stress even distorts one's ability
to perceive the passing of time.
It also leads the individual to con¬
centrate on the immediate rather than
the distant future. "It's the problem
of the drowning man you have to get
him to breathe before you worry about
whether he will catch pneumonia,"
Dr.- Holsti said, but then added: "Un¬
fortunately, short-term advantages may
be long-term disadvantages."
I
|N times of crisis, states¬
men tend to filter out information that
does not agree with their own opinions,
to consult only a limited number of
advisers, or none at all. Going back
to World War I, Dr. Holsti remarked
that the Kaiser wanted to believe that
Britain would stay out. In the margin
of a report from his ambassador to
London warning him not to count on
British neutrality, he wrote: "This old
fool's information should not be believ¬
ed." He thought much more of his
ambassador to Russia who was telling
him what he wanted to hear: the Czar
would never go to war over Serbia.
Dr. Holsti then moved to the eve of
the Second World War. Robert Van-
sittart, British Permanent Under-Secret¬
ary for Foreign Affairs, kept insisting
that the Soviet Army was not weaker
than the Polish Army and that Hitler
was not likely to be satisfied by a piece
of Czechoslovakia. Convinced that no
one was reading his memos, he pur¬
posely mixed their page order and
received them back still in the same
order, initialled as having been read.
As usual, Dr. Kun spoke with the
voice of his own past. He related
how he had served In the Hungarian
resistance movement during World
War II. "Stress was high near the
end of the war. The streets of Buda¬
pest were full of corpses, we in the
underground had lost contact with
each other. I was responsible for the
lives of 400 Jewish children who had
to be kept hidden and fed. We found
that our performance was highest
under stress. Today, I just cannot
imagine how I performed my duties
then."
Dr. Hamburg commented that
studies do show that some people are
highly creative, under stress, but that
this is not true for all. Dr. Holsti
agreed with him on the basis of the
lessons gleaned from recent world
history. They raise what he called the
biggest question of all: what can be
done ? The answer, in his opinion, is
to buy time.
Dr. Holsti' compared the summer of
1914, which saw "a great increase of
communications, but not with one's
enemies", to the Cuban missile crisis
of 1962. He pointed out that Presi¬
dent Kennedy took great pains to get
alternative viewpoints before taking
decisions, even absenting himself from
discussions because he knew that his
presence, as the president, might
inhibit them.
When it was decided to pull back
American vessels so as to give Soviet
ships more time, the message was
sent not in code, but in clear so that
it could be intercepted. An inter¬
cepted message, Dr. Holsti said, was
deemed to be more credible than a
public statement. "I certainly hope
that the world will not undergo another
Cuban missile crisis, but it did prove
that how one behaves under stress
can make a difference in such a situa¬
tion."
D
R. Holsti did not go along
with the widely-held belief that indivi¬
duals unable to withstand stress fall
by the wayside in politics, a process
that President Truman summed up in
his famous remark: "If you can't stand
the heat, get out of the kitchen." To¬
day, said Dr. Holsti, "there are new
paths to the attainment of political
power. We cannot rely, if we ever
could, on the normal pattern of poli¬
tical advancement to weed out peo¬
ple unable to cope with pressure."
Nor can we go on relying on war as
a force for human evolution. This
reminder came from Dr. Robert Bige-
low of the zoology department of the
University of Canterbury, at Christ-
church, New Zealand. Dr. Bigelow
is the author of The Dawn Warriors, a
book in which he sets forth his theory
that warfare played a fundamental part
in the development of man.
During prehistoric times, early
human societies competed with each
other for space. Individuals within
groups had to co-operate for defence;
they needed signs and symbols to
communicate. "The most co-operative
groups took over new terrain and
pushed out the least successful groups
by killing them," said Dr. Bigelow.
"Within one or two million years, the
size of the human brain trebled and so
did man's capacity to communicate."
"The extent of human co-operation
rose enormously. I think that we now
have only one or two steps further to
go to achieve global co-operation.
We cannot eliminate competition but
we have good cause to hope we can
render old-fashioned warfare obsolete,
even though it was warfare that forced
us to co-operate. If we don't exter¬
minate the species with nuclear
weapons, global co-operation is Inevit¬
able, although we may have a dark
age of two or three centuries."
A
Ltime scale for the chan¬
ges in brain structure that Dr. Bigelow
cited was supplied once more by
Dr. Washburn. He pointed out that
early man's brain capacity remained
unchanged for two or three million
years. During this period, there was
not much evolution, either, in the stone
tools that he produced.
"Then, 700,000 years ago, a very
different kind of tool appeared. Any
fool can make the early tools but
experiments have shown that graduate
students cannot succeed in reproduc¬
ing the later ones even after ten weeks
of laboratory work. Man's brain had
become twice as large. He had a
new order of skills, he knew fire, he
was hunting large animals. There
was one species of man in the Old
World from China to England.
"It would seem that, 40,000 years
ago, the whole game changed again.
We see different tools and it is at this
time that the roots of our present-day
languages may have appeared. If
you put Java man into our school
system, he would not get anywhere,
but late Neanderthal man would go
right through college." And, one
could not help but think, without
anyone even noticing his caveman
manners or hair style.
We seem to be right back where we
started when the curtain went up on
history. Not quite, however. Humans
are as aggressive as ever, but we now
wield not clubs but megatons. We just
cannot go on living the same way if
we are to go on living at all. To yi
quote Dr. Washburn once more: "Man ""
must adapt the species that did not
adapt are extinct."

{7 the end of the meeting
on human aggressiveness, Dr. David
Hamburg weighed up man's chances
for adapting, and summed up what he
and his colleagues had concluded
about the basis for both individual and
group aggressiveness and the likeli¬
hood of doing something about it.
His opening premise was optimistic:
"Aggressive customs, though built on a
biological base, can be modified, but
not easily. If aggressiveness is then
reduced, other types of constructive
activity become possible." This is
a task for education, which, said
Dr. Hamburg, "must teach not only
that violence is bad but that there are
other ways of coping with problems
In an emotionally-charged situation."
He said that the discussions had
brought out four major categories of
situations leading to individual aggress¬
iveness: a clear and present danger to
survival; frustration of self-esteem; a
threat to close personal relationships;
and a threat to one's sense of belong¬
ing to a larger group.
While Dr. Hamburg had been one
of the meeting's most forthright critics
of the effects of bloodshed and
violence in TV shows on young minds,
he saw television as an extremely
hopeful tool. He recalled. In this
respect, the solidarity he sensed in a
Stockholm hotel lobby when about
100 persons from all over the world
were watching the return of the
Apollo 13 flight.
"The potential unifying effect of
television was never so obvious to
me... but perhaps one need not have
astronauts near death to use television
in this way."
As an immediate step, he recom¬
mended that the mass media show the
seamy side of aggressiveness. "Vio¬
lence must be in bad taste on tele¬
vision if it is to have the effect of
reducing aggressiveness."
Then he looked at the positive side
of the problem. The scientists at the
meeting, like so many of their pre¬
decessors, agreed that a substitute
must be found for aggressiveness.
Dr. Hamburg summed up their feeling:
"If hunting and warlike activities are
no longer appropriate to develop the
self-esteem of young males, then there
must be something else." He suggest¬
ed that children should be given more
of a chance to see what their fathers
do for a living so that their only
"male models" will no longer be the
hard-shooting cowboys and criminals
on the screen.
Following his remarks. Dr. Makami-
nan Makagiansar, an Indonesian social
scientist who is now a Unesco staff
member in Paris, made it clear that the
problem goes beyond the individual.
"We must change institutions that
create situations where one must be
aggressive to survive," he said, and
drew an example from his own recent
experience.
Coming from Indonesia, where
cradle-to-the-grave security is provid¬
ed by the family and language is full
of buffers to prevent feelings from
being rubbed raw, he landed in Paris
with a car. "I thought I could never
drive in Paris, but I did. I just became
as aggressive as some Paris drivers."
Dr. Holsti, the political scientist,
transposed this view to the world
scene. "In the present international
system, we play the game under rules
like those that apply to driving in Paris.
One need not posit that others are
aggressive. If we do, this can make

To untold millions of youngsters, the
"tough guy "..law breaker or fast-drawing
cowboy.. has become a staple "hero".
Hostility and hate, violence and brutality
are built-in ingredients of many TV films
and so-called "comic" books. Many
psychologists now believe that other
occupations and professions can also be
made very attractive, so that the
trigger-happy cowboys, criminals and
under-cover agents no longer constitute
a major source of glamour for children
and young people.
a system as dangerous as the Paris
traffic system sometimes seems."
That is the very root of group
aggressiveness as Dr. Hamburg saw
it in his conclusions. He called for
research on "the virtuosity of the
human mind to provide justification to
harm out-group members." These
justifications are usually based on
three reasons: the damage that "they"
might do to "us"; the damage that
"they" might do to themselves if they
were not prevented; and the conviction
that the "others" are not really human.
What is unusual about these beliefs,
said Dr. Hamburg, is that they can be
produced by a great variety of political
and social systems. Progress will be
achieved only when it is generally
recognized that all societies are dan¬
gerous, not just the other fellow's.
"Man is a potentially violent animal
organized into potentially violent
societies."
We will have much more of a chance
of survival, in Dr. Hamburg's opinion,
if we can come to think of ourselves
as a single species, if we can identify
ourselves with a world species while
respecting diversity of cultures. Per
haps the family can serve as a model
for a human family but, as participants
in the meeting had already remarked,
it is difficult to expand from the
awareness of a small number of
people to a world community.
Dr. Hamburg and others felt the
need for a "superordinate goal" to
weld the world together. "A threat
to the species could be effective," he
remarked, "but we have lived in the
shadow of extinction for twenty years
while our statesmen still talk in 19th
century terms. Perhaps we need
100 years to avert the danger of
nuclear war . . . but will we get the
remaining eighty?"
He saw more immediate hope in
what we called "overlapping group
memberships" that can link people
together through multiple loyalties.
Business, industry and international
organizations can provide them. A
particularly good example, he felt, is
that of the graduate students in univer¬
sities who can serve as a bridge
between the students and the faculty
in times of crisis. Such reconciliation
services could be developed on a well-
organized basis for many more situa
tions where violence is likely to break
out.
As the meeting drew to an end,
other members came up with their
ideas to cut tensions and violence,
whether national or international. The
suggestions flew thick and fast:
"Peace corps" types of activities for
youth; revision of history textbooks so
that they no longer teach violence;
education in international understand¬
ing in schools; a Unesco survey of the
world's educational systems to see
why they make people think they
belong to a superior group . . .
Old Unesco hands at the meeting
almost thought they were watching a
ghost. Nearly twenty-five years ago,
these were the ideas in the air when
Unesco came into being in a world so
shaken by the ravages of war that
people were convinced nothing of the
sort could ever happen again. Today,
that illusion has gone. History is
repeating itself, the unthinkable is
once more in sight and in mind. This
meeting showed that man has a
chance to survive if he can recognize
why he behaves the way he does.
But he will not have very many more
chances if he does not.

AN is supposed to be the
all-round-adaptable animal. Yet in
modern times an ever-increasing num¬
ber of medical, psychological and
social workers is concerned with the
care, and if possible the cure, of an
even more rapidly growing number of
socially ill-adapted, maladjusted indi¬
viduals. According to common belief,
Man is also an essentially social
animal. However, beliefs vary widely as
to how Man as a social being should
behave. Thus it is hard to define con¬
clusively the individual's place in the
community.
In an attempt to find out something
which might also throw light on #the
fabric of human societies, no animal
species living in some sort of social
organization has been spared compa¬
rison, from ape and wolf down to bee
and ant. On such findings the value
of which cannot be doubted a variety
of theories has been based.
At present the prevailing opinion is
that there is always some kind of co¬
operation between or combination of
nature and nurture as the two possible
sources of human social behaviour,
with the emphasis heavily on nurture,
especially learning. However, the
argument continues, and as more de¬
tailed data and facts are amassed, we
seem to get further from a comprehen¬
sive understanding of the patterns and
forces underlying the social life and
development of our own species.

seem odd to expect any new clue to
be gained from the study of solitary
animals instead of those living in a
community. Certainly, when Dr. Rose-
marie Wolff and I, at first indepen¬
dently and not knowing about each
other, started to investigate the beha¬
viour of free-ranging domestic cats, we
did not envisage this surprising result.
First let me recall some facts about
the ranking order or dominance hierar¬
chy which the Danish psychologist
T. Schjelderup-Ebbe discovered some
forty years ago in the domestic fowl
and which, with very slight variation
only, seem to apply to almost all verte¬
brates which live in social groups.
Schjelderup-Ebbe found that the
hens of a barnyard do not by any
means have equal rights, but establish
among themselves a "peck-order" in
which each individual is allocated a
definite place on the social ladder
which it is normally unable to alter.
Usually a subordinate does not even
try to fight a superior animal even if
grossly provoked. When it does, it is
almost invariably quickly subdued.
Very rarely, and only after prolonged
and bitter fighting, does an inferior
animal succeed in improving its social
position by degrading a formerly
superior one.
The resulting ranking order is mostly
linear: hen A pecks B but is not peck¬
ed by her, B pecks C but is not peck¬
ed by her, C is thus automatically
inferior to A, and so on throughout the
whole flock. Quarrelling usually occurs
only between individuals separated by
one step of the social ladder...
The resulting social hierarchy is very
rigid, and it is absolute, meaning that
the ranking between any two given in¬
dividuals of the flock, once established,
is observed at all times, in all places,
and under all circumstances. Through¬
out this article, therefore, it will be
called "absolute social hierarchy". The
main prerequisite of its proper function-

ing is that all the members of a com¬
munity know each other individually.
This kind of social hierarchy prevails
largely in communities of animals nor¬
mally living together as adults and in
families which break up as soon as the
young are capable of looking after
themselves the parent(s) always hold¬
ing the top position(s). Since the social
habits of most, if not all, vertebrates
living in communities have evolved in
that they ceased to break up their
families after the young had reached
maturity, the evolution of absolute
social hierarchy has its roots in family
life itself.
Solitary animals would not seem to
need any kind of social order. They
occupy a piece of land, a so-called
territory, on which they will not allow
any other member of the same species
to stay, the only exception being a
mate during the reproductive season.
Within his territory the owner is
with very few exceptions which we
need not go into here superior to all
strangers, and easily wins if an Intruder
should actually choose to stay and
fight. His courage and self-assurance
diminish as the distance from the cen¬
tre of his territory increases. Thus,
neighbouring individuals soon find a
line of balance between them, and
once such a boundary has been
established neither will go beyond it.
Territories of this kind were first
observed in birds by B. Altum and
H. E. Howard independently. It is in
birds that they have since been best
and most extensively studied, with the
result that bird biology and bird beha¬
viour have largely framed the whole
concept of territory.
Professor Heini Hediger of Zurich
Zoo was the first to realize that the
original concept had to undergo cer¬
tain adaptations if it was to be of
good use when studying solitary mam¬
mals. He pointed out that a mam¬
malian territory consisted not so much

Animal communities and human societies react to overcrowding in exactly the same way,
say scientists. Studying the effects of overcrowding on animals, they have found
that even so-called solitary animals such as the cat have strictly organized social
hierarchies, and that cat behaviour and social patterns too are influenced by overcrowding
in the territories they "occupy".
of a solid area as of a number of
places first and second order homes,
spots for sunbathing and resting, look¬
out posts and feeding areas connect¬
ed by a network of pathways. The
owner of the territory moves along the
paths to his various points of interest
and activity according to a more or
less fixed timetable, and the spaces
enclosed by the pathway network are
seldom or never used.
In defending their territories, most
solitary mammals are at a great disad¬
vantage as compared with birds. They
cannot lift themselves onto the highest
perch and from there survey the whole
of their territory, and most mammals
do not "mark" their presence acoust¬
ically as song-birds do. Thus they
often fail to notice trespassers. The
border areas of domestic cat territories
overlap considerably in the sense that
pathways and places of interest are
shared even if the first order homes
are well spaced out.
"Sharing" in this context does not
necessarily mean that the animals
concerned are on good terms with
each other. When they meet on disput¬
able ground they may fight. But with
territorial behaviour being dependent
on proximity to the territory centre
(first order home) the victorious cat
will not extend its pursuit of the defeat¬
ed one too far into unknown territory
and too far away' from its own home.
Thus, unlike dominance in a group
governed by absolute social hierarchy,
superiority gained through territorial
fighting is from the start more or less
confined to the locality of the fight
and, after a series of such fights at
different localities, the ranking bet¬
ween the neighbouring individuals still
applies only in the border area and
may even be reversed from one spot
to the next according to the distance
from their respective first order homes.
Nor is this the only condition limiting
the ranking order resulting from terri¬
torial fighting. The timetable of an
animal's movements about its territory
is constant enough to enable one for
merly beaten in a territorial fight over
a certain spot or path to adjust its
schedule with regard to that spot so as
to avoid the risk of an encounter with
the victorious opponent...
From all this, it will have become
apparent that, quite unlike absolute
social hierarchy, any ranking between
two individuals based on the outcome
of territorial fighting is largely subject
to locality and time. I therefore call
it "relative social hierarchy..."
Both types of social hierarchy can
be present in the same animal species.
The chaffinch for instance, as the
extensive studies of Peter Marler have
shown, changes seasonally from one
type to the other in correlation with its
reproductive cycle. In the cat, abso¬
lute ranking order is normally estab¬
lished among the siblings of a litter,
and also among the adult male cats of
a region.
Males keep less strictly than females
to a defined area surrounding their
homes, and when rutting they tend to

wander well beyond what may be con¬
sidered as their territory proper.
Accordingly they frequently meet at
places which none of them claims as
territory. The result, after some seri¬
ous fighting, is a fixed ranking order
between the males of quite a wide
area, and then the serious fighting
practically ceases.
Yet there is one striking difference
as compared with the absolute rank¬
ing order within a group which lives
together all the time: the torn cats,
after meeting outside their own ter¬
ritorial grounds, return to their homes
and into their territorial rights where
their supremacy is not challenged,
whatever their rank may be "outside."
Here they heal their wounds and regain
their confidence, and thus are never
as totally and utterly subdued as the
lowest-ranking in a permanent social
group.
If In a region there are several torn
cats almost evenly matched, they
have it out with each other and after¬
wards are very careful not to provoke
any more serious fighting, which might
only endanger their position. At first
this relationship resembles an armed
truce, but as the animals gradually be¬
come accustomed to each other it
leads eventually to friendship, in the
limited sense that the animals may like
being together for a while and even
keep company in their pursuit of love
and ... novice males.
Such a loose and temporary asso¬
ciation of adult males I have called a
brotherhood. Their competition for
females attains a pro-forma quality,
and it is largely the females who make
the choice. Hard and continued fight¬
ing ensues, however, when some¬
where in the brotherhood's region
there is a young torn just reaching
maturity and setting out to battle his
way into the brotherhood.
Singly or together, the "brethren"
walk up to the youngster's home and
summon him to fight. Since the adoles¬
cent will not accept defeat as any sen¬
sible adult would, he will continue to
challenge any member of the establish¬
ment until he has either won his place
among them or is finally defeated and
either driven out of the neighbourhood
or even killed.
It would, however, be entirely wrong
to deduce from the foregoing that fight¬
ing and mutual repulsiveness are the
only factors forming the basis of the
social structure of so-called solitary
mammals. It has frequently been
observed in songbirds, and even some
fish, that, after fighting initially over
the boundaries of their territories, they
eventually come to tolerate neighbours
coming close to the boundary and
occasionally even trespassing, but still
drive off all trespassing strangers.
With cats, relations between neigh¬
bours need not stop at sharing border
areas by mutually avoiding all encoun¬
ters. They may tolerate each other
within seeing distance or even greet
each other in a friendly manner before
separating again... Thus, solitary ani¬
mals are certainly not asocial and
some form of friendly neighbourliness
may develop.
It will be evident by now that relative
social hierarchy, being associated as
it is with territorial behaviour, is inse¬
parably linked to the spacing out of
the Individuals of a population, that is
to population density.
Density as a factor in the inner ma¬
chinery of absolute social hierarchy is
not so obvious at first glance. Its
importance is shown best by the fact
that species which under normal free-
ranging conditions show no recogniz¬
able signs of any ranking within the
group, for example the Brown Rat or
the Night Heron, will establish absolute
social hierarchy when crowded.
T
| HE influence of the density
factor can be easily studied by keeping
groups of animals of either social type
under conditions where density can be
manipulated. The effect of increasing
density on absolute social hierarchy is
invariably to emphasize the tyrannical
aspect of the system until life becomes
practically unbearable for everyone in
the group except the overlord, and in
time the strain and stress of having to
assert himself begins to tell even on
him, whether the species under obser¬
vation be doves, or wolves, or goats.
Hence absolute social hierarchy is also
dependent on density and room for
man if it is to work without
lasting detriment to the group.
With relative social hierarchy, results
do not seem quite so clearcut at first.
Again, cats provided us with the first
clues. Other investigators as well as
myself found that any given group of
cats kept in close confinement did not
seem to develop an unvarying rank
order, although as density increased
one animal, usually a male, might
emerge as undisputed overlord, and
one other animal or even two as
"pariahs" who eventually could not
make the slightest movement without
provoking attack from some other
animal in the group.
Since the only known kind of rank¬
ing order at that time was the one de¬
scribed here as absolute social hierar¬
chy, these observations were explain¬
ed by assuming that cats, being solit¬
ary animals by nature, simply lacked
the potentiality for forming a stable
ranking order.
Only after observation of free-rang¬
ing cats had suggested tô me the exis¬
tence of a second principle of rank¬
ing, namely relative social hierarchy,
and after I had realized that cats are
quite capable of establishing absolute
hierarchy, within the litter as well as
the torn cat brotherhood, it dawned
upon me that what we observed in the
caged cats might simply be a mixture
of the two kinds. In short with increas¬
ing density absolute hierarchy be¬
comes more and more prominent
and the manifestations of relative
hierarchy dwindle away.
Another idea arose from this: since
even in animals commonly regarded as
solitary and asocial some traces of
communal life could be found which
are governed by absolute social hie¬
rarchy, perhaps in animals normally
living in large groups ostensibly gov¬
erned by absolute social hierarchy
there were marginal parts of their
social life in which relative hierarchy
prevailed? In between these two
extremes there might be many animal
species habitually showing some signs
of both kinds of hierarchy?
There is at least some indirect
evidence pointing in that direction:
some species, like the African lion
and the grizzly bear, have a faculty for
living either as solitary, territorial
animals, or in groups more or less
determinedly defending group territo¬
ries, according to habitat or season.
Herding animals like the wapiti deer
show territorial behaviour in some re¬
gions but not in others.
These observations show that both
kinds of social organization are poten¬
tially present in these and other mam¬
malian species. Taken with the results
obtained from captive communities,
they also suggest that the proportion
of the two forms of social hierarchy
has a different optimum in each spe¬
cies. Moreover the balance is not
rigidly fixed and may be shifted within
certain limits before any distinct, out¬
ward signs of behavioural disorder
become manifest.
This point seems to be of the great¬
est importance, because it indicates
the probability, if not certainty, that
well within the apparent or obvious
limits of density tolerance there are

## [Page 29](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/078262engo.pdf#page=29) 0

### 56904: The Sane community, a density problem?

latent tolerance limits beyond which
damage is surreptitiously done long
before it becomes apparent-
People undoubtedly show territorial
behaviour in many forms and in many
spheres of their lives. Professor Bayr-
Klimpfinger of Vienna has shown that
it starts in the nursery. Garden walls,
no-trespassing posters, the "my home
my castle" attitude of mind, the way
people and especially children are
quick to stake out their claims on the
holiday beach and resent all "intru¬
ders," are clear examples of this all-
pervading tendency to territorial
behaviour.
There is, on the other hand, hardly
any need to point out examples of
absolute social hierarchy in human
societies, ancient or recent, primitive
or evolved: chieftains, princes, kings
and the carefully elaborate hierarchies
of their courts, armies and manage¬
ment of modern big business, as well
as' teenager gangs, are only a few...
Nearly five years in prisoner-of-war
camps taught me that overcrowded
human 'societies reflect the symptoms
of overcrowded wolf, cat, goat, mouse,
rat or rabbit communities to the last
detail and that all differences are
merely species-specific; the basic for¬
ces of social Interaction and of orga¬
nization are in principle identical and
there is true homology between Man
and Animal throughout the whole
range of vertebrates.
To recognize such an internal
balance in man between absolute and
relative social hierarchy, brought about
The clearly defined
divisions of an empty parking
lot provide an ideal area for
"territorial zoning" by
a group of children. Many
scientists believe that, like
certain animals, humans have
a strongly developed sense
of territory which reveals
itself at an early age.
Intrusion on one's "area"
is often resented.
by evolution as part of a density-con¬
trol mechanism, which limits the adap¬
tability of the individual, is not to deny
that adaptability. What it does mean,
however, is that the mental health of
the Individual is in danger and will
eventually break down if adaptability
is stretched too far beyond the limits
set by evolutionary adaptation. If this
happens to enough individuals to cons¬
titute a sizeable proportion of a com¬
munity, then that community ceases to
be stable, healthy and fit for humans to
inhabit.
Density surreptitiously creeping
beyond the tolerance limits may create
symptoms which cannot be directly and
easily traced back to it as their cause
but are often attributed to factors
which are merely contributory or symp¬
tomatic in themselves.
The resulting constant subliminal
tension will lower the individual's re¬
sistance towards other disturbing fac¬
tors. Thus I have no doubt whatever
that a great number of neuroses and
social maladjustments are partially or
totally, directly or indirectly; caused by
overcrowding.
Professor J.B. Calhoun and others
have shown that crowded conditions
seriously disturb maternal care in rats
and mice. Likewise human mothers,
according to Professor René Spitz, are
deeply influenced by population den¬
sity: they often cannot form and main¬
tain the proper emotional bonds
towards their babies; this in turn inter¬
feres with the child's "ego formation,"
with its whole character development
in which early youth and proper mater
nal care and affection are m> vastly
important. Nothing shows better than
this what far-reaching damage can be
done indirectly to future generations
by the parent generations being too
densely packed.
This is our situation now, and we
have already been in it a long while.
What every normal man wants for him¬
self and his family is a detached house
in an adequate garden, with neighbours
close enough to be found if needed or
one feels like a social call, yet far
enough away to be avoided at other
times.
What we see Instead is the cance¬
rous growth of the huge blocks of
flats of so-called satellite cities creep¬
ing out into the countryside, and very
soon we shall reach the point where
individuals simply cannot any longer
be allowed to acquire a piece of land
of their own and erect a single family
house on it: in the interest of the Com¬
mon Good the block of flats will have
to become compulsory. Our civilization
is marching with banners flying from
battery hen to battery consumer.
In recent years there has been grow¬
ing concern about the so-called popu¬
lation explosion and the measures to
be taken to avoid overcrowding. How¬
ever, this is mostly understood to
mean that an attempt should be made
only to slow down the population In¬
crease so that the production of sup¬
plies, predominantly food, can catch
up, and if this is achieved everything
will be fine or so many of those in
authority seem to think.

look- as if controlling the population
growth were mainly a problem of the
under-developed countries. In the in¬
dustrially developed countries, our
affluence distracts from the fact that
we are already overcrowded. We
recommend birth control to the under¬
developed nations, but in our own
overpopulated countries we still encou¬
rage large families with tax relief and
even handsome allowances.
Contrary to current discussion, the
danger of overpopulation does not rest
solely on the need for food and shel¬
ter. It lies in whether the population
will exceed the limits of human toler¬
ance towards the presence of other
humans. These limits have been set
by evolutionary processes over mil¬
lions of years. They cannot, therefore,
be altered or trained differently within
a few generations, nor can they be
neglected, repressed or overstepped
without seriously disrupting the inter¬
nal harmony of the species.
It will be argued that my assertions
run contrary to almost everything
which is regarded as scientifically safe
in modern psychology and sociology.
The concept of adjustment is almost
invariably understood as pertaining to
the adjustment of Individuals to en¬
vironment, especially social environ¬
ment. Hence, where disharmony bet¬
ween Individual and social environ¬
ment Is found, this is generally explain¬
ed as failure of the individual to adjust.
True as this Is in some cases, it
overlooks the fact that in many res¬
pects the environment fails to be
adjusted to the proper needs of the
Individual. Modern psychologists have,
in many instances at least, been so
amazed and overwhelmed by the enor¬
mous range of variation found among
human personalities and behaviour pat¬
terns that they have largely forgotten
that all variations are but variations on
the one theme, the species. Nothing
can happen to or become of the indiv¬
idual which is not within the range of
the characteristics defining the species.
But today most psychologists are
so sure of the omnipotence of indiv¬
idual adaptability and learning that
they are blind to the facts which would
help to reveal exactly what is the role
of genetic that Is phylogenetic in¬
formation in all the different types of
human behaviour.
Yet our social psychologists and
sociologists are so convinced that
everything in social behaviour can,
and therefore must, be trained, learn¬
ed, institutionalized, that they fail to
see a very plain fact: traditions and
I institutions would never be stable if
they did not rest on an Innate behav¬
ioral basis.

THE SANE COMMUNITY (Continued)
Overcrowding and the threat to democracy
32
cesses, all changes in cultural, trad¬
itional, educational, religious, philoso¬
phical and institutional attitudes appear
to stir the surface only. The very core
of human nature and conduct has
evidently remained unchanged through¬
out known human history.
One of the age-old characteristics
of the human species is that it is
adapted to social life in a small group
where each member knows each of the
others personally, having a need for
larger social gatherings from time to
time but not too often, feeling a need
to be by himself quite often, and react¬
ing to continued oversocialization with
all sorts of frustrations, repressions,
aggressions and fears which soon
develop into genuine neuroses. As it
Is a species characteristic it does not
matter whether we like or regret the
fact. We have to live with it and find
conditions which allow us to live with
it in comparative health, wealth and
sanity.
That it is, for instance, possible to
rear and train children so that they
become habituated to oversocialized
conditions until they are unable to feel
safe and happy outside a crowd of
their own kind certainly does not
invalidate my point.
Children and even adults can be
trained or habituated to avoid every¬
thing good and healthy, to see their
only source of contentment and even
happiness in regularly over-eating all
sorts of palatable but unbalanced food,
in continually seeking unsuitable and .
demoralizing amusements, in all kinds
of perversions and addictions, and
similarly in living continuously in a
crowd. Robbed of these conditions,
the afflicted individual will feel
thoroughly dejected and miserable. Yet
this "adjustment" to mass communities
does the human species no more good
than drug-addiction or alcoholism.
As mentioned earlier, all structurally
organized vertebrate communities de¬
pend for their internal structure and
function on the Individuals being per¬
sonally acquainted with each other.
This is the most fundamental difference
between such communities, which
therefore rightly deserve to be called
societies, and the highly organized
communities of bees, ants and ter¬
mites, in which individuals in the sense
of known personalities are wholly unim¬
portant and, as a matter bf fact, not
to be found: any given Individual will
do for a certain function provided it
Is of the right "caste" or in the right
phase of its life cycle.
In a vertebrate community, however,
which is not solely governed by abso
lute social hierarchy, the individual not
only acquires personality, he also has
some place, some preserve, where he
is superior to all other members of the
community. No matter how big or
small the territory may be, and no
matter what the ranking of the indiv¬
idual in the various absolute hierar¬
chies of the community, as a territory
owner he is equal among his equals.
In this capacity, and in this capacity
alone, the human individual is able to
enter, as a responsible, participating,
co-operating, independent, self-res¬
pecting and self-supporting citizen, the
type of communal organization we call
a democracy.
^^PVERCROWDED conditions
are thus a danger to true democracy
which it is impossible to exaggerate.
Tyranny is the almost inevitable result,
whether it be exercised by personal
tyrants or by an abstract principle like
the Common Good, which is no longer
any good at all to the mass of indiv¬
iduals. For this is an unalterable law:
as long as density is tolerable, sacri¬
fices made for a common cause will,
one way or another, pay dividends to
the individual and contribute to his
own fulfilment. Beyond this point,
however, the demands of the Common
Good rise steeply, and what is taken
away from the individual is gone for
good; he cannot even see that it goes
in any sizeable amount to others, for
they are likewise robbed without
reward.
If, in accordance with V.C. Wynne-
Edwards's. theories, the innate balance
of relative and absolute social hierarchy
once served as density control mech¬
anism and thus ensured that social
life did not develop into unbearable
social pressure, why has it now
apparently ceased to function in man?
To the biologist the answer is obvious;
hardly any biological mechanism works
independently of others and faultlessly.
Thus density tolerance in humans is
adapted to a certain level of child
mortality, to a "natural" percentage of
people dying prematurely of diseases
and plagues, and so on.
Scientific and technical progress has
altered all this, but it could not and
has not altered the basis of human
social behaviour and happiness which
has been built into each individual by
at least five hundred million years
of vertebrate evolution. This cannot
be altered in harmony with the whole
except by that same, slow process of
evolution, taking countless generations,
and any attempt to force it will only
result in the destruction of our own
species.
But the density control mechanism
described . here at length can be
revived and brought into its natural
and beneficial function again if we use
our rational powers to restore the
equilibrium, and use them swiftly and
efficiently. It is no longer a question
of forestalling future overpopulation:
we must not only call a halt to further
increase, we must find ethically and
psychologically acceptable means of
slowly shrinking numbers back to less
than the present, to a sane density
level. There is no time to be lost.
At present most people seem
paralyzed by fear of The Bomb, but
the bomb in itself is no danger. The
only real danger to Man is men, too
many men. Statisticians have fore¬
cast that by 2040 the world population
will have reached 22,000 million. By
then production may possibly be capa¬
ble of feeding, clothing and battery-
keeping these numbers; but then nobo¬
dy will be able to move without being
impeded by numbers of other people
moving, and without interfering irrita-
tingly with their movements. At least
half the population will have to be
psychiatrists tending the neuroses of
the other half. To this future popu¬
lation, the bomb will no longer be a
threat but a temptation: it will appear
as the salvation from all evil.
I think we all agree that we want
neither the extinction of our species,
or at least of many future thousands
of millions through the bomb, nor the
re-establishment of the old, cruel
methods by which nature balanced our
numbers.
Thus the only way remaining is
humane density control birth control.
It can be done. Automation, if pro¬
perly used, can allow us to keep and
even enhance our living standard with
a slowly decreasing number of young
working people.
At present, under the influence of
an economic theory which regards
ever-growing expansion as the aim of
all economy and automation as a
means of stepping it up even farther
and faster, it can end only as all
unchecked positive feed-back mecha¬
nisms end: in catastrophe. The choice
is still ours: do we want rational
regulation and for some time reduc¬
tion of numbers, or unrestricted pro¬
creation and the Bomb as Ultima
Ratio?

### 56907: The Tower of Babel

fe
THE TOWER
OF BABEL
by Friedrich Ragette
A
An imaginative 17th century concept
of the Tower of Babel engraved on
copper one of many versions of
the Tower conceived by artists
throughout the centuries. The raising
of the Tower is related in the Old
Testament and differing descriptions
of the building were given by the
Greek historian Herodotus (4th century
B.C.) and the Greek geographer
Strabo (1st century A.D.).
Drawing Q Donald Thompson
[S told in the Old Testament
(Genesis: 11) the story of the Tower
of Babel is one of the most fascinating
stories of all time. It tells, concisely, of
man's efforts to build a great tower
into the heavens, of God's wrath at
such arrogance and of the curious
punishment He imposes. It has colour,
excitement and a moral that is plain
to see:
"And the whole earth was of one
language, and of one speech. And it
came to pass, as they journeyed from
the east, that they found a plain In the
land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.
And they said one to another, Go to,
let us make brick and burn them thor¬
oughly. And they had brick for stone,
and slime had they for mortar. And
they said, Go to, let us build us a city
and a tower, whose top may reach unto
heaven; and let us make us a name,
/est we be scattered abroad upon the
face of the whole earth. And the Lord
came down to see the city and the
tower, which the children of men
builded. And the Lord said, Behold,
the people is one, and they have all
one language; and this they begin to
do: and now nothing will be restrained
from them, which they have imagined
to do. Go to, let us go down, and there
confound their language, that they may
not understand one another's speech.
So the Lord scattered them abroad
from thence upon the face of all the
earth: and they left off to build the
city. Therefore is the name of it call¬
ed Babel; because the Lord did there
confound the language of all the earth:
and from thence did the Lord scatter
them abroad upon the face of the
earth."
The moral of the story, of course, is
that man should keep his place and
not aspire to God-like creativity. But
down through the centuries the theme

of the story man the builder challeng¬
ing God the creator has been inter¬
preted and reinterpreted according to
the age.
In medieval times the moral element
pride goeth before a fall was
uppermost. During the dynamic, self-
confident Renaissance the story was
an occasion to celebrate the ingenuity
and adventurousness of man. In the
Space Age, the era of nuclear fission,
it might well express renewed doubt
about the ultimate results of man's
endeavours.
The story has had a particular appeal
to artists. From faithful artisans carv¬
ing simple versions on cathedral walls
for the enlightment of unlettered
peasants to imaginative giants like
Brueghel, painting his splendid works
for the pleasure of the world, it has
been a fruitful subject for Invention
and enlargement.
Perhaps it was the idea of man's
recurring ambitions to create struc¬
tures as high and as everlasting as
possible. Perhaps it was the intriguing
picture of thousands of workers sud¬
denly breaking out into strange incom¬
prehensible tongues. Whatever, the
reason, it touched the artistic imagi¬
nation and brought forth almost as
many versions of the tower as there
were artists attempting to depict it.
Some saw the tower as an early ver¬
sion of the leaning tower of Pisa.
Some saw it as a massive pile of
receding blocks of stone. Others
likened it to a great wedding cake.
Only a few turned to the surviving
descriptions of what the tower actually
looked like.
One of these descriptions came from
the attempt Alexander the Great made
to rebuild the tower after he found it
in ruins. (Some 10,000 workers clear¬
ed away the rubble but with Alexan¬
der's death in 322 B.C. the project
stopped.) Another, earlier description
came from Herodotus, the Greek his-

### 56907: The Tower of Babel

TOWER OF BABEL (Continued)
A scoop for Herodotus
How a 16th-century Flemish painter
visualized the Tower of Babel. The artist
may have been Inspired by the account
of Herodotus which describes a square
based tower with stepped-back storeys
and a spiral staircase to the summit
Texts and inscriptions dug up in
Mesopotamia in modern times have led
archaeologists to suggest that the
legendary Tower of Babel may have been
one of the "ziggurats", tower-like
temples erected by the Sumerians, offering
their gods a stepping stone between
heaven and earth. Above, a suggested
reconstruction of the Tower of Babel
made in 1918 by the German archaeologist
Robert Koldeway, who excavated many
sites in Mesopotamia and wrote several
books on Babylon. Below, another
archaeologist's reconstruction in 1930 also
recalls the form of Sumerian "ziggurats".
torian who visited
460 B.C. and gave
account:
Babylon about
an eye-witness
" In the midst of the temple a solid
tower was constructed, one stadium
(about 200 yards) in length and one
stadium in width. Upon this tower
stood another, and again upon this
another, and so on, making eight
towers in all, one upon another.
All eight towers can be climbed by
means of a spiral staircase, which runs
around the outside. About halfway up
there are seats where those who make
the ascent can sit and rest. In the top¬
most tower there is a great temple, and
in the temple is a great bed richly
appointed, and beside it a golden table.
No idol stands there. No one spends
the night there save a woman of that
country, designated by the god himself.
The priests told me that the god des¬
cended sometimes to the temple and
joined her... but I cannot believe this."
With such a tangible description on
record one would think there would be
no doubts that the tower of Babel
really existed. But since Babylon, for
more than 20 centuries, was really
little more than a name a vague
legend of grandeur and a few undif¬
ferentiated mounds of earth in Meso¬
potamia serious historians still tend¬
ed to dismiss the story as no more
than an interesting legend.
Then, in 1854, the British Foreign
Office notified its consul in Basra,
Mr. J. E. Taylor, that the British Mu¬
seum wanted someone to search out
ancient ruins in southern Mesopota¬
mia. Mr. Taylor obliged and In excav¬
ating those undifferentiated mounds
uncovered the top of a large man-
made brick structure and some clay
cylinders on which was written, in
cuneiform, the history of the building.
They were not startling discoveries
but they did point the way for the expe¬
dition in the 1920s during which Sir
Leonard Woolley, under the auspices
of the British Museum and the Univer¬
sity of Pennsylvania, found the famous
"Ur of the Chaldees," the birthplace
of Abraham, and unearthed evidence
that the stories of ancient Babylon
were not legend, but history.
It had been a splendid history while
it lasted, rivalled only by that of ancient
Egypt in brilliance and depth of civiliza¬
tion. It began sometime in the fourth
millennium before Christ when a non-
Semitic people called the Sumerians
descended from the mountains of Per¬
sia and settled on the fertile plain bet¬
ween the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.
They built cities, invented cuneiform
writing, and perhaps the wheel, chan¬
neled the waters of the nearby Euphra¬
tes into a remarkable irrigation sys¬
tem, perfected the art of the goldsmith
and built great towers of bricks made
of clay. From them, eventually, evolv¬
ed the Babylonian civilization, the cen¬
tre of which in the waning centuries of
Mesopotamian importance, was Baby¬
lon, "the Glory of Kingdoms."
By any standards Babylon was a
magnificent city. Sprawled along the
banks of the palm-lined Euphrates,
Babylon was a great metropolis of
broad avenues and high buildings,
numerous temples and great walls.
Through the magnificent Ishtar Gate, a
structure of yellow brick adorned with
lions and bulls in glazed blue tile,
streamed thousands of merchants, sol¬
diers, priests and farmers. Armour glit¬
tered in the sun and chariots clattered
down the avenues to the river.

Tiny ant-like figures swarm over the

transport of brick and lime, leaving their
powdery red and white traces on the
tower. The works of Pieter Brueghel, the
foremost of a famous family of Flemish
painters (and called "the Elder" to
distinguish him from his two famous
painter sons) reveal the everyday life and
new ¡deals of the prosperous Flanders of
his day (1 6th century) where a strong
current of humanistic thought had replaced
many outmoded medieval attitudes and
beliefs. The second tower is published in
colour opposite page 39.

time, was already a famous centre of
international trade. Left, another detail
of the painting. Brueghel imagined the
structure as an intricate system of Roman
arches and vaults. But the ziggurat
temples of Mesopotamia, which may
have inspired the idea of the Tower of
Babel, were a solid mass of masonry.

The masons of Sumer

Opposite: Top, Pieter Brueghel's
second "Tower of Babel," in the
collection of the Vienna Kunsthistorisches
Museum. Larger than its Rotterdam
counterpart (144 by 155 cm; 4ft.
9 ins. by 5ft.), it is painted on wood and
dated 1 563 by the artist himself (the

imposing building recalls the Coliseum

he visited Rome. In the foreground,

gardens extended almost as far as the
eye could see. And high above, look¬
ing down on this magnificence and out
across the plains from a height of
nearly 300 feet, stood the great tower
that the ancient Jews, herded into
Babylon for 70 years of captivity, were
to describe to the world as the Tower
of Babel.
In digging out the history of Babylon,
archaelogists found that in every im¬
portant ancient town in the land bet¬
ween the rivers there existed the
remains of towerlike structures called
- ziggurats. They also discovered repre¬
sentations of stepped towers on seals,
amulets, cylinders and bas-reliefs, as
well as cuneiform texts giving the
names and dimensions of the towers.
Eventually, near what is now the
village of Hilleh in Iraq, they uncovered
the ground plan of a particularly large
tower. It was made of burnt bricks
and was some 300 feet square. Texts
found in the ruins called it "Eteme-
nanki, the House of the Foundation of
Heaven and Earth."
The texts also told of its restoration
during the reign of Nabopolassar in
625 B.C., mentioned baked bricks,
streams of bitumen, the counsel of
Babylonian gods, and, some 60 years
later, the conscription of foreign labour
by the famous Nebuchadnezzar to
continue the restoration.
It all fitted. This was the Tower of
Babel, and the Tower of Babel, al¬
though perhaps larger and more impor¬
tant, was no more than another of the
ziggurats that dotted the Mesopota¬
mian plains. Thus they had at once
confirmed the Biblical story and pro¬
duced at least a possible explanation
of its combination of two unrelated
subjects: the building of a tower and
the diversity of languages among men.
For thousands of years, apparently,
ziggurats were an integral part of Me¬
sopotamian cities, each differing from
the other in detail like the cathedrals of
Europe, but essentially the same: mas¬
sive cube-like blocks, with stepped-
back upper terraces, and monumental
stairways leading to upper sections
from which spiral stairs ascended to
the topmost platform on which stood a
temple or shrine.
Inevitably they reminded the explor¬
ers of those other marvels of ancient
engineering, the pyramids of Egypt.
But while the pyramids were tombs,
built by individual rulers to provide safe
resting places for their bodies and to
ensure their comfort in afterlife, the
ziggurats were clearly places of wor¬
ship, built, enlarged, restored, and em¬
bellished by generation after genera¬
tion. Why, archaeologists wondered,
was such tremendous labour expended
to give them this form?
From available evidence, the answer
seems to be this. The Sumerians ori¬
ginated in mountainous country. They
frequently depicted their gods standing
on mountain tops, and many of the
animals in their art are of a mountain
type. When they migrated to the plain,
they did not change their religion but,
where nature had failed to provide
, mountains, they fashioned their own
out of the only material available to
them: clay bricks.
Thus, far from challenging God as
the Hebrews thought, the Sumerians
and their successors worshipped from
the ziggurats, and offered their gods
a stepping stone between heaven and
earth in the hope that they would des¬
cend and follow them to their new
habitat.
As to the second part of the story,
God's decision to "confound their lan¬
guage," one theory Is that the captives
might have mistaken the sacred name
of Babylon, Bab-ili, meaning the gate of
God, for the Hebrew balal, meaning
confusion an ironic twist In a story
about a confusion of tongues.
Another theory is that because many
nations had traversed the plains of
Mesopotamia, Babylon probably hous¬
ed people of many races remnants
of older inhabitants, slaves and con¬
scripted labour, perhaps business or
diplomatic representatives of neigh¬
bouring tribes all speaking different
languages or dialects.
To the simple nomadic Jews, march¬
ed off from their pastoral lands
800 miles away and set down in this
teeming city, the diversity of language
was unsettling and mysterious and
called for an explanation. In the habit
of seeking theological explanations for
all human phenomena, they may have
concluded that the confusion of ton¬
gues was God's curse on the Babylo¬
nians for setting up strange religions
and for constructing these arrogant
towers into the heavens. That, in any ma
case, is how they told it and why, ever Jjjl
since, Babel has been a warning to
man to limit his pride and put a rein
on ambition.

WAR IS NOT

HERE are still men and
women living who can remember the
horror which greeted Darwin's theory
that we are "descended from apes."
That phrase probably accounted in part
for the revulsion because "descended
from" was generally used in a more
personal way "I am descended from
Scottish ancestors," that is, I am one
of them, I am like them. Darwin
meant, of course, "We have evolved
from apes," with apes standing in for
the whole range of evolved animals.
The first, grudging acceptance of
evolution was in connexion with phy¬
sical structures: it was hard for anyone
to deny such evidence as the develop¬
ment of a thinking cortex on top of
a simpler brain. The idea of the
evolution of behaviour, however, has
been slower to win support, for there
is no "fossil behaviour." From fossil
bones, guesses can be made as to
the ways that the bones were used,
but how can anyone ever reliably know
the origins of the habits of today's
animals or of our own?
Nevertheless, the evolution of beha¬
viour is now inspiring one of biology's
hottest debates.
Darwin himself laid the groundwork
for it when he wrote The Expression
of the Emotions in Man and Animals,
and showed how closely alike the
signs of emotion are. This book was
largely ignored, at least in its implic¬
ations, for the mechanical age had
arrived and there was more interest
in putting captive animals into pieces
of apparatus, in testing their reflexes,

SALLY CARRIGHAR has spent more than
30 years studying animals in their natural
habitats. Out of this experience she has

kan wildlife, and 'Wild Heritage", a sum¬

mazes, to count, and to discriminate
between colours and forms problems
like these.
About 1950, however, a group calling
themselves ethologists broke out of
the laboratories, declaring that the
most reliable facts about animal beha¬
viour are secured by watching animals
in their natural habitats. From the
discoveries made by these thoughtful
observers, it soon became clear that
we really don't know very much about
how most animals lead their lives,
about what animals do. Dr. William
H. Thorpe of Cambridge University was
one of the first to stride boldly on to
the battlefield with the statement:
"There is hardly any aspect of the
behaviour of animals which may not
have some reference to problems in
human behaviour."
Some ethologists fell on that battle¬
field and went back to the laboratories.
The ones who stayed in the field had
to endure some ridicule; they were
called Boy Scouts and taunted with
the criticism that their work could not
be a science since most of it was done
without experimentation. Some of this
obviously stung, for few ethologists
are now simply trying to fill in the
great gaps in our knowledge about the
daily lives of wild animals. Work in
the field must now include experimen¬
tation, and some ethologists are even
confining the animals that they study
in artificial environments which they
call "semi-wild."
Meanwhile, the behaviour of animals
has fascinated the non-scientific pub¬
lic. Readers devour Joy Adamson's
Elsa books, George Schaller's reports
of his gorilla companions and those
of Jane van Lawick-Goodall about the
chimpanzees with whom she and her
husband live. An increasing number
of popular films and television pro¬
grammes about animals whet this in¬
terest. And if orthodox biologists hold
out against assuming any lines of
descent in human behaviour, from all
sides laymen are asking what we can
learn from living animals.

What about the relationship between
the sexes? What about care of the
young and their training, about the
health of animals and how they main¬
tain it, their feeding habits, how they
relax and the ways in which they play?
Above all, with war so great a threat
in our lives, what about animal
aggression?
This last has been the subject of
two recent and readable books: On
Aggression, by Konrad Lorenz (the
noted Austrian zoologist), and The
Territorial Imperative, by Robert Ardrey
(American writer and anthropologist by
avocation). Both authors declare that
fighting is an instinct which demands
expression in virtually all higher ani¬
mals and also in ourselves because,
they claim, we have inherited this
compulsion. Before examining their
arguments, however, it is first necess¬
ary to define exactly what is meant
by aggression.
Most laymen would think at once
of predatory attacks on prey for food:
the pursuit, the pounce, the kill. The
biological definition, however, excludes
this kind of slaughter because it
involves no malice. A wolf bringing
down an ill or aged caribou (a strong
caribou can outrun a wolf) is no more
angry than we are when we buy meat
at the butcher's shop. He is merely
hungry.
Nor is there any true aggression,
any malice, between members of
different species going about their
separate ways in the wilderness they
share. They seem to recognize that
each has different needs and perhaps,
in their inarticulate way, they even
recognize that other species have
rights. On a path used by many or
at a water hole or salt lick, the weaker
and smaller animals await their turn,
letting the stronger go first without
argument.
Aggressiveness in its strict biolo¬
gical sense, and in the sense that
Lorenz and Ardrey use the word, is
expressed between two members of
the same species when both want the

The Latin proverb "homo homini lupus" man is a wolf to man has
been taken over by nearly every society which derives its customs, laws
or language from ancient Rome. This is a libel on the wolf, which
is a gentle animal with other wolves. More appropriate would be
"homo homini mus rattus" man is a rat to man for, exceptionally
among carnivores, some rats kill other rats, just as man kills others of
his own species.

Rats, clans and captivity
same thing. With the great majority
of animals, this same thing will be
living space in which to raise the young
of the year an animal's home site,
also known as his territory.
Sometimes aggressiveness is arous¬
ed over possession of a desired female
or over rank in a hierarchy. Biologists
often call the space around a disputed
female a territory. It moves when she
moves and the male, going along, will
not allow another male to approach
within a certain well-understood dis¬
tance.
Lorenz and Ardrey both tie their
definition of aggressiveness in man¬
kind to home territory. They call
attention to properties marked with
"No Trespassing" signs and this is
their ominous and essential theme
they extend the concept of farms or
suburban lots to the nation, claiming
that men fight to preserve or expand
their national boundaries almost as
involuntarily as they would their homes.
They fight the soldiers of other nations
because their remote animal ancestors
once instinctively fought for nesting
site, burrow, hunting range or the
space which encircles a female.
T

HUS both Lorenz and Ar¬
drey are convinced that war is an
instinctive compulsion. Lorenz says
that the most important function of ani¬
mal aggression "is the spacing out of
individuals of one species over the
available habitat, in other words, the
distribution of "territories." He conclu¬
des: "There cannot be any doubt, in
the opinion of any biologically minded
scientist, that ¡ntra-specm'c aggression
is, in man, just as much of a sponta¬
neous instinctive drive as in most other
higher vertebrates."
Ardrey, for his part, says: "If we
defend the title to our land or the
sovereignty of our country, we do it
for reasons no different, no less innate,
no less ineradicable than do the lower
animals" (italics added). He also
says: "All of us will give everything
we are for a place of our own." And:
"I believe man's innumerable territorial
expressions are human responses to
an imperative lying with equal force'
on mockingbirds and men."
Now, a widespread belief that human
wars are instinctive, by which biolo¬
gists mean inevitable, would of course
tend to make them inevitable. There¬
fore it seems worthwhile to inquire
whether aggression is universal in
animals and just how insistent an urge
it is. If aggression, as these authors
insist, is a doom carried in human
genes, we are predestined to wage
wars and hopes for peace would seem
to be slim.
It must be agreed that during mating
seasons, at least, disputes over terri¬
torial boundary lines are prevalent.
Spring when most animal young are
born and many conceived, is a time
of much sparring for areas on which
to raise them and find their food. But
for some species, late summer and
fall are the rutting season, and that is
the time when the "territories" surr¬
ounding females are fought for. In
most cases, such aggressive beha¬
viour is related to reproductive needs.
To the creatures themselves, terri¬
tory probably means home in the same
way that home, for us, means more
than house. To them the need may
be temporary but it is not surprising
that they instinctively fight for it.
But how universally and how despe¬
rately? The doom of eternal war
would not seem so inescapable for us
if some animals Indeed, if any of them
can escape the compulsion.
Caribou have, no territories; neither
do elephants. Sea otters don't. They
copulate in the water and raise their
young in fronds of seaweed. Whales
are not likely to have individual home
sites, although no one knows definitely.
Lemmings live in villages, shallow
excavations in the Arctic frost mounds,
with several lemmings sleeping toge¬
ther in each nest until a gravid female
is about to give birth, when she makes
a nest of her own.
These could be called colonies.
There are numerous animals In the
temperate zone who have communal
dwellings: gophers, prairie dogs, mar¬
mots. What goes on in their hidden
worlds, at each stage of the annual
cycle, is imperfectly known for most
species. Some colonies defend the
territory shared by all; it appears that
others do~ not. Within the burrow it
is customary for an individual family
to defend its own unit.
What of cowbirds, which lay their
eggs in other bird's nests and then
are off to live on the backs of cattle
(formerly bison), feeding on the para¬
sites in their hosts' fur? It is amusing
to speculate on whether individual cow-
birds claim certain cows as their
territory. It seems unlikely.
Among primates, most monkeys live
in groups. In some there is a hierar¬
chical social organization. Usually the
dominant male has first choice when
a female is in oestrus and discord
often prevails. Other groups are
sexually promiscuous and among them
fighting often seems abhorrent. If
youngsters are too aggressive, the
adult males will separate them.
Howling monkeys claim possession
of their communal areas but defend
them generally with only vocal protests
as do gibbon families. When their
screams fail to drive away intruders,
gibbons may bite, but such occasions
are rare.
The English ethologist J.H. Crook
discussed the question of territory in
The Listener, April 6, 1967. He ex¬
plained the very flexible attitude of
some birds and animals usually thought
to defend territories. A territory
"allows an individual to develop a
close familiarity with a locality. This
increases its food-finding efficiency
and the speed of finding refuge from
enemies." But some ducks that mate
on their wintering grounds, or on
migration, will accompany a new
spouse to its home site instead of
returning to their own.
Species may change territories in
response to local conditions. In drier
years, certain marsh-dwelling weaver
birds will disperse their nests over a
large ground area; in wetter years,
they may congregate in a large tree
islanded in a flood pool. Harem
groups of the gelada baboon wander
independently in poor feeding years
but "congregate in large herds of
variable size under conditions of plen¬
ty. They have no territories, their
disposition directly reflecting the local
food availability."
Chimpanzees, says Dr. Crook, vary
the size of their parties. As a rule
individuals and small groups wander
over large home ranges and "territorial
behaviour appears to be absent." The
facts are complex he says. "The dis¬
persion pattern itself must depend
largely on learning and tradition, and
this is particularly so when we are
talking about advanced mammals such
as the monkeys. The sort of territory-
holding present is more likely to be
determined by the commodities for
which the higher mammals compete
than by any species characteristic
directly determined by the genes.
Thus in different ecologies, territorial
systems will vary or even be absent
altogether."
A
LRDREY is not a biologist,
as he himself explicitly and creditably
states in his book. In reporting the
work of professionals, he seems simply
to have misjudged the emphasis that
they put on territories and territorial
aggression.
Lorenz, of course, is an ethologist
of world repute, but his experience
with animals is limited in a different
way. He has done most of his research
with tamed animals, such as geese
induced by guard fences and food
to live in a human environment, and
with captive cichlid fishes in tanks.
All creatures so confined have their
aggressiveness heightened enorm¬
ously.
As Lorenz himself explains, these
two types of animals, fish and birds,
are among those which demand "indiv-

### 56909: War is not in our genes

¡dual distance," meaning that they do
not welcome, at any time, anywhere,
the close approach of their con-speci¬
fics (the biological term for others of
one's own species). Lorenz's fish and
geese, disturbed by the enforced intim¬
ate association with their mates, have
worked out rather elaborate rituals for
"redirecting" their aggression from
mates to neighbouring males. Since
these are only symbolic attacks, the
adjacent male seldom is Injured, and
the spouse, with his aggression now
neutralized, returns to his mate trium¬
phant.
Rituals of the same sort are not
employed by our own class of animals,
mammals, for mammals are "contact"
species that is, they seek and enjoy
the touch of their own kind. This
distinction between animals who want
and those who do not want to be near
their con-specifics is only mentioned
briefly by Lorenz, but it is actually of
the most basic importance.
Lorenz sets out in detail the observ¬
ation that among all strongly aggress¬
ive 'animals there is a very powerful
inhibition against killing con-specifics.
Since they do, unavoidably, often
annoy one another, however, various
behaviour patterns have become
established to prevent fights with lethal
consequences.
L
IORENZ describes the
well-known reaction of a defeated
wolf. As soon as he recognizes that
he will lose a fight, the wolf turns his
head away, a movement that the victor
immediately understands and accepts.
When Lorenz described this wolf be¬
haviour in 1952 in King Solomon's
Ring, he spoke of it as the loser
"offering his neck" to his opponent
moving evidence of good faith bet¬
ween wolves, inasmuch as the victor
always withholds the final bite.
Since that time, Lorenz has more
firmly become a "mechanist." In On
Aggression, he describes the loser's
behaviour as one of the "submissive or
appeasing movements [which] have
evolved from juvenile expression move¬
ments persisting into adulthood. This
is not surprising to anyone who
knows how strong the inhibition against
attacking pups is in any normal dog."
But however defined, the wolf ritual
works; it prevents the killing of a con-
specific.
Another form of ritualized, harmless
fighting is the "tournament," such as
the pushing contest between two
ungulates (deer or other hoofed qua¬
drupeds) during the rut. If they really
wanted to kill each other, they would
attack with their hoofs (as they do a
predator). Instead they literally lock
horns, each trying to make the other
give way. As soon as one knows
himself to be losing ground, he disen¬
gages his antlers, turns and runs, and
the winner goes back to his females.
Perhaps from their concentration on
the subject, both Ardrey and Lorenz
seem to have exaggerated impressions
of the amount of con-specific aggress¬
ion.
When Lorenz writes of "all this
fighting," and fighting as being "such
an ever-present process" in nature, he
is describing a wilderness that would
not be recognized by those who, like
myself, have lived there for years at
a stretch.
On some mornings one finds blood
on the snow where tracks of fox and
hare collide, but that is evidence of
prédation, not the encounter of an
animal with another of its own kind.
Real aggression, usually reproductive
in its origin and purpose, concerns the
animals so briefly that most of the
several dozen species I am familiar
with spend far more than half their
time some of them as much as 11
months in the year in casual or
amiable association with their fellows.
Typical are black bears. After a
rather perfunctory but successful court¬
ship, a male returns to a drowsy life,
the daytime often spent in a copse
with four or five other males. They
do, however, show animosity toward
one of the off-shade bears, that are
a colour phase of their own species.
The forest rangers say that these
rejected bears become neurotic.
Both Lorenz and Ardrey distinguish
too briefly between offensive and
defensive fighting. Is one who def¬
ends his territory "aggressive?" If
not, if only an invader is properly so
described, how many do thus intrude?
Extremely few, except in captivity.
Among wolves, one who comes into
the territory of another's family may
be seeking companionship (a "lone
wolf" is usually an orphan). Accord¬
ing to most observers, he is not attack¬
ed; he is simply threatened and he
leaves and is not pursued to the
border.
Those who describe the wilderness
from a domestic garden like Darwin's
or Lorenz's fenced enclosure and lab¬
oratory or Ardrey's library, tend to
put the emphasis on a few, dramatic
animals like rats, wolves and lions.
Rats are contact species, and to
explain some fights he saw among rats,
Lorenz suggests that they were not
personal confrontations, that rat clans
tend to kill all outsiders. Such group
aggressiveness would seem especially
ominous because of the possible an¬
alogy with mankind's national wars.
But here, as with geese and fish, Lo¬
renz is presenting evidence provided
by captives, and captives held In con¬
ditions so unsatisfactory as to stimu¬
late fighting.
As Lorenz describes them: "Stein¬
iger put brown rats from different
localities Into a large enclosure which
provided them with completely natural
living conditions. At first the indiv¬
idual animals seemed afraid of each
other; they were not in an aggressive
mood, but they bit each other if they
met by chance, particularly if two were
driven towards each other along one
side of the enclosure, so that they
collided at speed." (Most biologists,
incidentally, would not call the condi¬
tions provided by any enclosure as
"completely natural" especially not if
it were so small that individuals collid¬
ed when racing along the fence.)
Steiniger's rats soon began to attack
one another and fought until all but
one pair were killed. The descendants
of that pair formed a clan, which sub¬
sequently slaughtered every strange
rat introduced into the habitat.
D
URING the same years
that this study was being conducted,
John B. Calhoun in Baltimore was
also investigating the behaviour of rats.
There were 15 rats in F. Steiniger's
original population; 14 in Calhoun's
also strangers to one another. But
Calhoun's enclosure was 16 times
larger than Steiniger's and more fa¬
vourable in other ways: "harborages"
were provided for rats pursued by
hostile associates (such refuges would
probably exist in the wild), and all
Calhoun's rats were identified by
distinctive markings.
For 27 months, from a tower In the
centre of the large area, the move¬
ments of all the individual rats were
recorded. After a few fights while
getting acquainted, they separated into
two clans, neither of which tried to
eliminate the other. There was a good
deal of crossing back and forth un¬
challenged so often by some Indi¬
viduals that they were finally dub¬
bed messengers.
Lorenz says that only the most
aggressive creatures ever form per¬
manent pairs, but beavers mate for
life. And although their gnawing teeth
would serve as very effective weapons,
I have never known any occasion when
they were so used against con-spe¬
cifics. In their cleverly built houses,
behind the dams and network of
canals they have constructed, they
live in notable harmony with one
another and with the muskrats, for
whom they provide ponds and who
may be welcomed Into beaver houses
as badgers will receive, and make
friends with, coyotes and foxes.
How would such animals have time
for continual fighting? What the
absent biologists do not seem to
realize is that a wilderness is a com¬
munity of workers. Simply finding
enough to eat every day is a chancy
and tiring task.
It may be a surprise to know that
many animals also spend a great deal
of time keeping themselves clean and,
if possible, free of parasites. Primates
groom one another for hours every
day. One year, one of the small pretty
deer-mice came in to share my cabin, IA
and sometimes I wished she would L\Q
stop washing her fur; she did it so
incessantly it was tiring to watch.

Such mammals as these, in rising
strata of complexity these are our
ancestors, more recent than the primi¬
tive, sexually antagonistic fish and
geese. Many mammals have never
even developed rituals to prevent' the
death of con-specifics, because they
don't need them. Except when attack¬
ed by a predator, they quite simply
do not fight.
Our immediate forebears, the apes,
seem to have reached something like
a summit in non-aggressiveness, since

they do not fight either not as indi¬
viduals or as clans. Lorenz suggests
that they do not attack their associates
because they do not have such effec¬
tive weapons as the teeth of wolves
or the paws of lions, but would not
the arm of a full-grown male gorilla
be as strong as a lion's paw?
We do not know which mammals
were the nearest ancestors of pri¬
mates, but there are sufficient numbers
of non-aggressive creatures living today
to suggest that co-operation was
becoming the habit of evolving mam¬
mals even before the primates deve¬
loped. What, therefore, has happened?
Man obviously is an aggressive animal.
We have lost both the peacefulness
and the inhibition against killing others
of our own kind. Is there an expla¬
nation?
As Lorenz points out, aggressive¬
ness can be taught. It is also in¬
tensified when it is exercised (and
atrophies when it is not). When men
began to settle in communities, they
learned the irritations of being crowd¬
ed. By then they had probably learned
the use of weapons, originally for the
purpose of killing game. And since
they had already acquired at least a
rudimentary speech, they could absorb
from one another, and preach, animo¬
sity. With words, they could incite
hatred against neighbouring tribes. A
leader, coveting power or property,
could, with propaganda, instill in his
subjects admiration for warlike atti¬
tudes.
Perhaps that is the way culturally
rather than genetically that human
aggressiveness arose. As for sadism,
something no animal displays, it is my
belief that the trait is psychotic.
Nothing could more effectively
prolong man's fighting behaviour than
a belief that aggression is in our genes.
An unwelcome cultural inheritance can
be eradicated fairly quickly and easily,
but the incentive to do it is lacking
while people believe that aggression is
innate and instinctive with us, as both
Ardrey and Lorenz declare.
More than 100 years ago, the philo¬
sopher William Whewell wrote: "There
is a mask of theory over the whole face
of nature." Anyone writing about the
wilderness has a great responsibility
not to accept too readily a belief that
the mask is nature's true face. In a
chaotic and perfidious world, nature
is all we have that is infallibly real.
If writers assert their own, unproven
hypotheses as the truth, civilized
people, so isolated from the wilderness
that they cannot recognize a fallacy
when they hear one, will be deprived
of their one lifeline of what may be felt
intuitively as sane and good. Then,
even the intuition will be lost what is
there left for anybody but madness?

by U Thant
Secretary-General of the United Nations
M OR most of the time that
man has been on earth, his numbers
have been small and his power limited.
Damage to his environment was at
worst local, and usually subject to
repair by the regenerative powers of
nature.
Only a few centuries ago, in
1600 A.D., human beings numbered an
estimated 500 million, and much of the
world was uninhabited or unaffected
by man's activities. In the past few
centuries, however, the world's popula¬
tion has increased sevenfold and all
areas of the earth's surface have been
to some degree modified by man.
With the prospect of another
doubling of the world's population in
less than half a century, the need to
provide food, water, minerals, fuel and
other necessities for such increasing
numbers of people will place pressure
on virtually all areas of the earth and
demand the most careful planning and
management of natural resources.
Accompanying the growth of popula¬
tions in recent decades has been the
spread of urbanization. Forty per cent
of the world's people now live in
urban areas. In somewhat more than
half a century, if present trends
continue, urbanization will have reach¬
ed its maximum and the great majority
of people will live in towns and cities.
The rate of urbanization is more
rapid in the developing nations. In
1920, the urban population was 100 mil¬
lion in these countries. By the year
2000, it may well have increased
twentyfold. In the developed nations,
the urban population in the same
period will have increased fourfold.
Urbanization is not in principle
destructive to the environment. With .
proper planning and control, and if it
were proceeding at a slower rate, it
should enhance and not detract from
environmental quality by relieving
pressure on rural lands, by providing
goods and services in quantity and
diversity, by providing new and attrac¬
tive habitats and ways of life.
However, in most areas, govern¬
ments have neither prepared for, nor
have they been able to cope with, the
mass migration into urban areas. In

OF NATURE
large cities, slums of the most wretch¬
ed nature often become the environ¬
ment of people who once lived in
greater dignity and better health in the
countryside.
Pollution of air, water, and land in
urban areas have become universal
problems. Diseases associated with
urban living in developing nations have
increased. Noise and congestion add
to physical and mental distress.
Accompanying population growth
and urbanization is the accelerated
impact of industrialization, and of an
advanced technology that is often
poorly integrated with the needs of
man and the environment. The
production of crude petroleum was
negligible a century ago. By 1966,
however, it amounted to 1,641 million
metric tons per year. Between 1937
and 1966, annual production increased
sixfold. In the same period, the motor
car, scarcely known at the start of
this century, was produced at a rate
that grew from 5 million to 19 million
per year.
In the most recent decade, the total
value of all industrial production has
doubled. Industrialization is of vital
importance to nations which seek to
raise their living standards, but the side
effects of poorly planned or un¬
controlled industrialization and of the
one-sided application of technology
have been a direct cause of many
serious environmental problems.
The reliance of modern technology
upon the combustion of fossil fuels has
brought a 10 per cent increase in
atmospheric carbon dioxide over the
past century. This could rise to 25 per
cent by the year 2000. The conse¬
quences of such an increase upon
world weather and climate are un¬
certain, but could eventually be
catastrophic.
The increased use of modern
technology has brought major in¬
creases in the amount of waste pro¬
ducts which pollute the environment.
In the United States alone, this
amounts each year to 142 million tons
of smoke and noxious fumes, 7 million
automobiles, 20 million tons of paper,
48,000 million cans, 26,000 million
bottles and jars, 3,000 million tons of
waste rock and mill tailings and
50 million million gallons of hot water,
along with a variety of other wastes.
Other industrialized nations make
their comparable contributions of
debris and toxic materials, and while
technology is adequate to cope with
these problems of pollution, the
planning and application of pollution .
control lags far behind what is
required, often because of the cost.
' The spread of the urban-industrial
network with its transport systems is
consuming open space at a very high
rate. In the United Kingdom, for
instance, such expansion will consume
one-sixth of the farming land in the
next three decades. The spread of
an urban-industrial-transport complex
could enhance the human habitat, but
too often uncontrolled urban sprawl
destroys valuable resources, land¬
scapes and living things.
E
¡XPANDING populations
bring increasing demands upon the
productivity of agricultural lands for
food and fibre. Application of tech¬
nology to these lands has brought
greatly increased production but it is
vital that such gains should not be
offset by damage to the environment.
Increased use of fertilizers and. new
varieties of pesticides have raised food
crop yields, but some of these agri¬
cultural chemicals have side effects on
the environment that we are only
beginning to comprehend.
The maintenance of both atmo¬
spheric oxygen and the productivity of
marine environments, for example,
depends on photosynthesis by marine
plants, mostly the floating algae of
microscopic size. Minute amounts of
pesticides such as D.D.T. have been
found to inhibit photosynthesis in these
plants by 75 per cent. Yet we have
dumped an estimated 1,000 million
pounds of D.D.T. into our environment
and are adding some 100 million
pounds per year.

impaired by man's own misuse. Five
hundred million hectares (1,235 million
acres) of arable land have already been
lost through erosion and salinization,
two thirds of the world's forests have
been lost to production and 150 kinds
of birds and animals have become
extinct because of man. Approxim¬
ately 1,000 species or races of wild
animals are now rare or in peril.
Erosion, soil deterioration, deforesta¬
tion, watershed damage and the
destruction of animal and plant life
continue and in some areas are
increasing.
The environment of human settle¬
ments differs from all others in the
degree to which it is created and
controlled by man. It would be
expected that man, being presumably
rational, would at least have construct¬
ed for himself urban centres ideally
suited to his occupancy. In fact, the
opposite often appears to be true, and
it is within cities that some of the most
acute problems of the environment are
found.
In most developing countries, it has
rarely been possible to provide in
advance the urban planning and design
that would ensure a rational arrange¬
ment of space for living, working,
transport and recreation, nor has it
been possible to keep pace with the
demands for housing, water supply,
sewage disposal, education and the
other amenities of urban life. Rapid
urban development tends to overload
every kind of public service, including
transport and education.
The stress that often accompanies
accelerated change results in emotional
tension and a feeling of insecurity.
These in turn may lead to mental
breakdowns, psychosomatic illness,
suicide attempts and an increase of
crime, drug dependence and anti¬
social behaviour.
The deterioration of the physical
environment, the natural as well as its
man-made component, has social
implications which can hardly be sepa¬
rated from the problem as a whole.
Areas of natural beauty with an
abundant wildlife within reach of urban
areas have a social function of provid¬
ing recreation facilities for city-

warning "you are the endangered species" is timely,
following a recent estimate that man is filling the air with
more than 800 million tons of polluants per year.

dwellers, beside their intrinsic value
as part of a common heritage.
Historic sites and monuments form
a part of the man-made human envi¬
ronment, the value of which cannot be
overestimated. Their cultural and
social values for the individuals living
close to them as well as for mankind
as a whole are evident, and their
conservation, along with that of the
natural environment, merits the atten¬
tion of the international community.
T

HE magnitude of the prob¬
lem in some developing nations
appears to defy solution by anything
less than a massive national and
international effort. A first require¬
ment is that of urban planning and
design in which adequate considera¬
tion is given to the social needs of
the population, Including services. A
second is for a major programme of
construction and reconstruction. In
some places the establishment of
complete new towns and cities with
their own industries and other sources
of employment may be called for.
There is great need to explore new
patterns and frameworks for urban
living based on greater understanding
of human biology and behaviour and
consideration of social and cultural
factors.
The cost of such major programmes
of planning and construction far
exceeds any amount that has been
expended on cities at any period in
history. The need is for new facilities
to accommodate urban populations
that will have increased twentyfold
over a period of only eighty years,
from 1920 to 2000 A.D. The alter¬
native to such a programme is acceler¬
ating human misery and mortality.
In developed regions the urban
environment is afflicted with many of
the same difficulties encountered in
developing regions. Urban planning
and design lag far behind urban
growth. Where plans have been
made they are often pushed aside by
political, economic or social pressures.
Unplanned or poorly planned suburbs
spread over the countryside surround¬
ing formerly well-defined urban cen¬
tres, merging indistinguishably with
those spreading out from other
centres. The result is an urban con¬
urbation, a poorly defined and little
differentiated mass of urban tissue
within which the individual has diffi¬
culty identifying with a community and
Is beset with problems of transport¬
ation, congestion and pollution. It is
impossible to describe such areas as
cities, but only as urbanized regions.
Most developing nations lack
specialists qualified to deal with the
problems of urban planning and
development. Educational program¬
mes should thus be drawn up with
this need in mind. In the meantime,
international agencies and bilateral
assistance programmes will need to
provide technical and financial aid to
these areas.
Many national and international
programmes are under way, but all
fall short of existing needs. Brazil
has built an entire new city for its
capital, but. Brasilia is already plagued
with urban slums. Pakistan has taken
a lead in the planning and design of
Islamabad, but its overall urban
problems are Incredibly complex.
Over $9 million are being provided
to construct an experimental housing
project in Lima, Peru, but hundreds of
millions will need to be spent before
the problems of the barriadas (shanty
towns) can be solved. An idea of the
cost of planning and building modern
cities is given by the estimate from the
United States that a new city for
250,000 will cost $1,000 million.
One of the striking demographic
features of today is the rural exodus
set off by the stagnant economic
and cultural life of the villages in many
regions and the magnet of the city.
It is clearly impossible to provide the
smallest villages with all the equipment
and amenities of modern urban life.
Nevertheless, if rural life can be
made more attractive and living
standards raised, fewer people will
rush to the cities and more satisfactory
patterns of land use can be developed.
Many problems have arisen from the
large-scale construction of dams, re¬
servoirs, canals, power stations and
other works for the movement and
control of water in major river basins
or the transfer of water between
basins to provide for power, irrigation,
transport or city water supplies.
Such large scale development pro¬
grammes have been carried out on the
Nile, Niger, Volta, Colorado, Columbia,
Missouri, Volga, Rhone, Indus and
many other river systems. Major Inter-
basin transfers of water have been
discussed for Canada and Siberia.
Schemes to modify the entire Amazon
River basin and to open a sea-level
canal across the Panama Isthmus are
under consideration.
Economic and engineering factors
are given full weight in most of these
plans, but the broader impact on the
environment is inadequately consider¬
ed. Often little or no attention is
given to proper management of lands
in the watersheds developed by
engineering techniques. Among the
harmful effects that occur are silting
up of reservoirs, loss of delta lands,
salinization, spread of waterborne
diseases and the displacement of
peoples.
In the marine environment there Is
an obvious need, already considered
by the United Nations, for international
control over the exploitation of marine
resources and a system for making
rational use of these resources, which,
in the absence of effective control and
management, have been and continue
to be destroyed or depleted.
The decline of certain species of
whales and seals, of sea turtles, of the
Pacific sardine and the Atlantic salmon
fisheries, as well as the continuing
over-exploitation of the Eastern Pacific
anchoveta fishery are examples. The
growing dependence of man upon
the sea as a source of protein
requires that its resources be properly
managed.
P
OLLUTION of the sea is a
continuing threat to its future produc¬
tivity. Although the International Con¬
vention for the Prevention of Pollution
of the Sea by Oil has been in existence
since 1954, oil pollution is still a major
hazard, and other forms of equally
damaging pollution, over which little
or no control is exercised, continue.
Research on the problems of the
human environment is in progress in
most industrialized countries. At the
international level, such programmes
as the International Geophysical Year,
the International Biological Programme,
the International Hydrological Decade,
and the work of the Intergovernmental
Océanographie Commission have given
a significant boost to research in
important sectors of the environment.
Nevertheless, more emphasis has
been placed so far on research In the
physical and earth sciences than in
the biological and social sciences, and
even in the most industrially advanced

countries an ecological and Integrated
approach to research has rarely been
followed.
Nor, as underlined by the Unesco
Conference on the Resources of the
Biosphere in 1968, is education at all
levels and in all countries as yet
designed to promote a proper under¬
standing and appreciation of the nature
of the problems of the environment.
Only scattered efforts are being made
in this respect in certain countries,
mostly the developed ones, through
an increased emphasis on ecology at
the university level.
Very little educational material
suited to the needs of developing
countries Is as yet available, although
Unesco and the International Union for
the 'Conservation of Nature are now
working on the production of such
material.
The training of specialists and
technicians at all levels to handle
problems of the environment is clearly
a major need in the developing
countries, where efforts are now being
made to provide such instruction in
national institutions. Similar educa¬
tion, appropriate to national conditions,
is also given on a regional basis in
institutions such as the Middle East
Technical University at Ankara, the
Training Centre for Sanitary Engineer¬
ing In Morocco, the Turrialba Inter-
American Institute for Agricultural
Sciences in Costa Rica, or the Inter-
American Housing and Planning Center
at Bogota.
But all the efforts made thus far to
house population, to integrate technol¬
ogy into complex environments, to plan
and control Industrialization and urban
development and to manage land and
resources effectively have fallen far
short of global needs. Today, there¬
fore, all nations face dangers of
critical proportions that call for action
at the local, regional, national and
international levels.
There are so many problems that
choices must be made and priorities
established. It Is to analyse these
problems and to provide a focus for
world action that the United Nations
has called an international conference
on the Problems of the Human Environ¬
ment, which will meet in Stockholm
in 1972.
This text is based on a study, "Problems
of the Human Environment", presented to
the U.N. Economic and Social Council in
luly 1969 by U Thant, Secretary-General of
the United Nations.

Designs for a floating "vacuum cleaner" that sucks up oil spilt on the ocean
have been drawn up by the French Technocean Company. The rear twin hulls
of the vessel produce a funnel effect and the oil and water mixture is
sucked up through an intake valve at the V of the twin hulls. The mixture Is
filtered and the sea water jettisoned while the oil goes into the ship's
storage tanks. The ship is designed to treat some 13,000 cubic feet of water
per hour and to store the same volume of filtered oil.

a skyscraper city built in five years on a desert plateau in the heart of the world's
fifth largest country. Left, twin skyscrapers, serving as Congressional offices, rise
above Brasilia's dome-shaped Senate building. Yet already Brasilia is plagued with its
own "favellas", or urban slums, the outgrowth of a massive influx of people. Some
of these immigrants camp where they can, (above) while others swell the population of
new shanty towns, (below). The rush to the cities has created similar problems
in all parts of the world.

^^INCE the early days of

demonstrated in the Greek and Roman
cities. Other periods of history, how¬
ever, show a. deep attachment of
former generations of builders to their
natural surroundings. In the Byzan¬
tine cities and monasteries, for
instance, in the same part of Europe,
shape, colour and material combine to
form a complete unity with the land¬
scape.
Concentrated forms of settlement
have been chosen in nearly all parts of
the world where, in the evolution of
mankind, farming became the funda¬
mental structure of society. Our dis¬
tant ancestors usually built their
houses, villages and towns in com¬
pact units, in order to defend their
dwellings against intruders.
Even nowadays this old pattern can
be observed in different parts of
Europe. Classic examples of this
period are still to be found in a number
of medieval walled cities which con¬

started to build their palaces and villas

the Federal Republic of Germany, and
Schönbrunn in Austria, still exemplify
this period, in which the townsman
began to discover the attractions of
lural life.
In the dynamic process of man's
growing control over the natural world,
revolutionary changes have taken
place since the last decades of the
19th century. With the beginning of
the first industrial revolution, the strik¬
ing contrast between the "stone city"
and the "green country" began to give
way, and the strict boundaries between
the town and the countryside were no
longer respected.
With unlimited and uncontrolled
growth of urban development, dwel¬
lings and allied structures began to
spread over the land. The mass move¬
ment of people from the countryside to
the cities, the increasing expansion of
industry and the rapid growth of popu¬
lation are the main causes.
Large tracts of beautiful landscape,
evolved and shaped over centuries,
often disappeared in a few years as a
result of unbridled urban explosion and
a total lack of regional planning policy.
Since World War II, a new aware¬
ness of the values of the environment
has arisen. Unforeseen progress in
technical development has completely
changed the pattern of human society,
and the reconstruction and expansion
of urban zones has become one of the
features of post-war government
policies.
Much research and many experi¬
ments in the development of new
forms and policies of urban planning
have been carried out during the last
decade. Instead of the old pattern of
concentrated towns, new ideas have
been launched and realized.
The chilling prospects of the "Mega¬
lopolis" cleared the way for an en¬
couraging search for urban systems
more in keeping with man's needs and
human dignity. Linear towns, city
regions with open space systems,
satellite-town developments and the
"garden city" concept of the English
town planner, Sir Ebenezer Howard,
have been tested more or less suc¬
cessfully in several countries.
The concentration of people in ever
greater agglomerations is one cause

of the difficult situation that has arisen
in parts of Europe and elsewhere in
the world, and the migration from the
countryside to the big cities continues
in many countries.
In France, for Instance, no fewer
than 150,000 persons employed on the
land move to the cities every year. As
a result, the population of the towns,
large and small, will have doubled by
1985. By then, more than four-fifths
of the population will be concentrated
in towns. Almost 60 per cent of to¬
day's Parisians were born in the
country.
There has been a relative depopula¬
tion of the heart of France's big cities,
but at the same time an increase in
"suburbanisation." Between 1954 and
1962, the community of Paris lost
24 per cent of its population through
migration, but the population of the
Paris urban district increased by
30 per cent and that of the suburban
district by 65 per cent.

part of the Netherlands, the "Randstad

evolved, nearly one half of the popu¬
lation of the 'Netherlands is living in a
region which covers no more than two-
ninths of the total area of the country.
In the Ruhr area of the Fed. Rep. of
Germany and in the industrial centres
of Belgium, Italy and the United King¬
dom, similar situations clearly demon¬
strate the effects of a concentrated
urban structure.
In Europe, as in other parts of the
world, the impact of an enormous sub¬
urban sprawl on the surrounding
countryside is clearly apparent. Des¬
cribing these suburbia, a Council of
Europe report notes the existence of
"individual houses, small, mediocre
and monotonous, surrounded by tiny
garden plots which are the only outlet
for the personal taste of each owner,
expressed in the arrangement of his
kitchen garden, his patch of lawn, his
few yards of fence, with the result that
these dreary plots combine the worst
features of uniformity and diversity
alike.
"The final decline of the area result
ing from this nondescript concentra¬
tion of separate houses is difficult to
prevent," says the report, "precisely
because this type of housing satisfies
the desires of the majority of the popu¬
lation. In France, for instance, an en¬
quiry showed that 82 per cent of the
people prefer small houses to flats,
and the attachment to a small garden
may well be attributed to the resur¬
gence of a former peasant background
which, in a population only recently
urbanized, is never far distant."
In the United Kingdom, over 40 per
cent of the population live within six
vast urban concentrations. But this
country, the cradle of the "garden city",
has evolved new urban forms to meet
changing conditions and new ways of
life. In the last 20 years, extensive
public building programmes have
raised 14 new towns, now completed,
and 14 more are being built.
Based on this experience, new in¬
sights and new techniques have devel¬
oped rapidly in the United Kingdom.
Considerable attention has been given
to methods of studying the social,
economic and physical factors in new
town planning and how to use this
new knowledge.
Britain's first new towns were built
soon after the end of the Second
World War on sites containing rela¬
tively small centres of population in
the vicinity of an urban agglomeration.
The population target was usually fixed
at between 50,000 and 80,000. Many
of the towns chosen for expansion in
more recent years are already impor¬
tant centres in their own right and
have thus been able to build on the
basis of a large existing population and
an established industry. The maximum
scale of expansion that of the new
town at Milton Keynes provides for
a population of 250,000 in an area of
nearly 22,000 acres.
Earlier new towns were set up as
satellites in a ring about 20 to 30 miles
from the conurbation centre. More
recent new towns and major town
expansion projects tend to be sited
much farther away.
The recent new towns are visually
more sophisticated. Densities of con¬
struction are higher, but provide a

Invigorating the classic landscape
greater variety of accommodation. The
neighbourhood is no longer consider¬
ed as a distinct and separate physical
entity.
In each new town the landscape
character of the site has been fixed
at the start of the planning process, as
a guide in the location of all the land
uses. The design of each town res¬
pects throughout the character of the
landscape and its potentialities, a
policy which has proved of special
value in the later towns, incorpor¬
ating more distinctly urban concepts.
Town planners in England now have
in mind towns of 300,000 to 500,000 in¬
habitants, not located within an area
generally covered by local traffic.
These urban clusters would no longer
be satellites arranged around a nu¬
cleus, but new independent focal
points.
In France, the "départements" of the
provinces have relatively small scope
for activity in the field of economic
development. Paris, the focal point,
wields a tremendous influence. But
plans are now being, studied in France
to transform eight existing towns at
some distance from Paris into secon¬
dary metropolitan cities with up to one
million inhabitants.
In the Federal Republic of Germany,
urbanization has from the start devel¬
oped in a decentralized form due to
the spatial structure and the historical
development of the country.
u

RBANIZATION in its pre¬
sent form has a much greater influence
on the environment than ever before.
This is partly due to the scale of urban
development and partly as a conse¬
quence of the stronger relationship
between the urban and the rural
worlds. Communication between the
different urban concentrations increas¬
ingly opens up the countryside.
Greater land use and increasing
exploitation of natural resources are
also directly related to the urban
process.
There is a distinct connexion bet¬
ween a particular type of urban devel¬
opment and its effects on the country¬
side. Much depends on the attitude of
man and his ability to create and
handle efficient planning machinery.
In nearly all European countries the
existing landscape pattern Is strongly
influenced by man's activities. Some
parts are even completely man-made.
Nevertheless, a great diversity has
been created and maintained during
centuries of development. It is even
probable that the cultural landscape
of Europe is more varied than the
original natural scene which existed
before man transformed it.
This diversity is threatened by the
urban expansion of the last century
and particularly of the last few deca¬
des. Firstly, the spreading urban area
itself encroaches on the available land.
This increase is not only caused by
population growth but also by rising
standards of living. The basic features
of life demand far more space today
than at the start of the century.
The most spectacular effects of
urbanization on the environment can
be seen In a zone of varying width lying
between the frontier of the urban re¬
gion and the surrounding countryside.
In this transition zone a kind of "no
man's land" the town has not fully
established itself, but the genuine rural
land has already disappeared. Charac¬
teristic features of this zone are
decaying farms, junkyards, roads and
railways, electric power lines, airfields
and petrol stations and the ever-
present publicity hoarding.
Townsfolk and country people are
concerned with what is going to hap¬
pen in these transition zones on the
fringes of urban conurbations, but the
problem has not yet been sufficiently
understood and studied. A joint
approach by scientists, planners and
designers is urgently needed in these
areas to safeguard the interests of
both town and country.
Increased prosperity, better trans¬
port and more leisure have led to a
resurge of interest in outdoor life.
Living conditions in many urban areas
stimulate the desire of the townsman
to find relaxation in the countryside
during leisure time. Hence the in¬
crease of second homes in many Euro¬
pean countries.
The results of this offshoot of urba¬
nization need not be harmful to the
landscape providing such factors as
regional and landscape planning and
protection of the environment are
taken into account. In parts of Wes¬
tern Europe, good use has been made
of old abandoned farm houses which
have begun new lives as second
homes, and whose restoration, in many
cases, has made them attractive
examples of rural architecture and un¬
doubted assets to the landscape.
On the other hand, there are exam¬
ples, particularly in coastal areas or
other attractive scenic regions, where
second homes, week-end retreats or
holiday settlements have become liabi¬
lities to the landscape because no ade¬
quate planning and building control
exists.
T
HE time has perhaps come
to consider the possibilities for a
planned development of urban and
rural areas on a much broader inter¬
national scale. National planning
should at least consider and be based
on a framework for development of
"international regions" that could em¬
brace central, western and southern
European countries.
Such an approach is urgently need¬
ed. The interdependence of European
nations in several spheres of land use
is more and more evident. Growing
awareness of the implications of re¬
gional planning problems in all coun¬
tries and their increasing European
significance has led in recent years
to the setting up of regional co-op¬
eration groups in trans-frontier areas.
The expansion of international tour¬
ism means that an ever greater num¬
ber of people are visiting beauty spots
and recreation areas in different coun¬
tries. The increasing use of roads,
railways and other means of commu¬
nication creates an obvious need for
international consultation on the
management of these areas.
In an age when space exploration
and moon landings have become a
reality, it should be possible to
develop a proper management of man's
home here on earth. Urban develop¬
ment need not necessarily be destruc¬
tive to the countryside, but should be
one of the components of a compre¬
hensive policy for reconstruction and
rehabilitation of the environment.

an appropriate choice for the area.
To the 30,000 inhabitants of the new
town it has the familiar outline of the
coal tips that dot the landscape in
this coal mining area of northern France.
A dominating feature of the new
urban centre, the pyramid has also a
utilitarian purpose. It houses an
ultra-modern plant, supplying heat
and hot water to the entire town.
Within the pyramid, chimneys from
three oil-fired furnaces lead to a single
outlet in the apex. Special equipment

Growing to miraculous life amidst the flotsam of a great port, this sunflower
brings a moment's pleasure to a passing sailor. In the industrialized countries,
oil-fouled rivers, streams and estuaries often serve as sewers and rubbish
tips. Fish and vegetation no longer thrive in rivers whose natural course has
been modified to provide hydro-electric power. In Sweden, the government
has decided to maintain the river Vindelalven in its natural state so that
future generations will be able to marvel at the beauty of at least
one river undefiled by man.


### 56921: Industrial Europe faces the challenge of pollution

Industrial Europe
faces the challenge
of pollution
HE effects of industry on
the environment vary considerably
from one country to another.
Countries which have long been
extensively industrialized have already
been able to see for themselves the
bad effects of the growth of industry
on the environment and are conse¬
quently seeking remedies for them.
Countries where industrialization
has come fairly recently merely
emphasize the good aspects of the
process, and deliberately play down
the ill-effects because they are not
very noticeable.
Countries which are in the process
of becoming industrialized make great
play of the good factors of techno¬
logical development and almost ignore
the unfavourable side.
This is the varied picture for Europe
that emerges from reports to the
Council of Europe from member states
for a special study on "Industry and
the Environment." The study was
examined at the European Conserv¬
ation Conference convened by the
Council of Europe in Strasbourg, ear¬
lier this year.
The situation is relatively satisfactory
in countries with low population density
and limited urban and industrial
development such as Cyprus, Malta,
Ireland and Finland; it is less satisfac¬
tory in certain areas of Switzerland
ROBERTO PASSINO is Director of the
Institute of Hydrological Research of the
National Research Council, Rome. He
participated in a conference in February
this year on European conservation prob¬
lems, convened by the Council of Europe,
at which he presented a paper on "The
Effects of Industrialization on the Environ¬
ment". The above article is condensed
from this study.
and Italy; it is critical in France,
England, Germany and Belgium which
have long been industrialized.
In England, measures have been
taken to reduce pollution and damage
to the environment. The results are
encouraging. The construction of new
electricity power stations, gasometers
and refineries and their attendant
networks of overhead power lines
and pipelines is closely controlled
by committees of specialists whose
task is to preserve the beauty of the
countryside.
Special bodies are responsible for
the control of mining areas and the
rehabilitation of regions containing
worked out pits, the prevention and
control of coastal pollution by crude
oil, and the supervision of road, rail
and air route development. Special¬
ized research laboratories are studying
air, water and soil pollution and the
problem of noise levels and are work¬
ing out suitable countermeasures.
The Federal Republic of Germany
reports that efforts to combat pollution
have been intensified since 1960.
Water purification stations have been
built and it has been made compulsory
to fit filters to reduce air pollution by
dust. So far, however, there is no
equipment for the elimination of sul¬
phur dioxide. About 130,000 acres of
forest are affected annually by these
gases causing losses amounting to
21 million DM a year. Laws have been
passed to reduce noise.
In Belgium, where industry was at
first concentrated in the south but is
now spreading to the rest of the
country, the environment is exposed to
serious damage and the situation is
becoming worse. Laws and decrees
dealing with the problem already exist,
but further legislation is needed.
The number of factories in Swit-
by Roberto Passino
zerland, mainly in the textile and
chemical industries, has quadrupled
since 1900 with a resulting increase in
noise and air and water pollution.
Most Swiss lakes are heavily polluted.
The situation of Lake Constance, for
example, is alarming. Since 1950 the
phosphate content of the lake has
increased almost tenfold and plankton
thirtyfold. Attempts are being made
at federal, regional and local levels to
find new ways of preventing this
pollution.
In finland, industrialization is con¬
fined to the south where the population
density is also greatest. Contrary to
what might be supposed, Finland has
a poor supply of drinking water, be¬
cause many lakes are shallow and are
rapidly becoming asphyxiated as a
result of the discharge of domestic
and industrial waste. Already 10 to
15 per cent of the country's Inland
waters are polluted. Helsinki's drink¬
ing water has to be brought from a
lake 160 miles away. Air pollution,
however, is slight even in the largest
centres.
There are laws on the subject and
experimental centres have been set up
for the elimination of all types of
polluting agents. Considerable dam¬
age is, however, caused by some
industries whose effluents contain
highly toxic substances such as
chlorinated hydrocarbons, mercury
derivatives, etc., and measures have
been taken to eliminate these factors.
The use of D.D.T. has been banned
from this year.
The situation is quite different in
Malta where the government is
attempting to combat unemployment
by the introduction of new industries. K1

is polluting the atmosphere in the
densely populated area of Conspicua,
Senglea and Vittoriosa with serious
danger to public health. Sea water is
polluted by the discharge of large
amounts of waste matter by coastal
industries. There are no laws for the
protection of nature.
Cyprus too is faced with increased
industrial activity promoted by the
government's five year plans. The
industries concerned are mostly
connected with agriculture and use
electric power. Nevertheless, there is
a danger of pollution from the mining
of asbestos, copper and pyrite. There
are also oil refineries and gasworks
that mainly pollute the sea and have
a harmful effect on the development
of the tourist industry.
As a result of its special geogra¬
phical situation, decentralization in
Austria has brought its own problems.
The small valleys are often the most
seriously affected. Fumes, dust, noise
and smells constitute a real threat to
the environment. Although some
regional laws have been passed to
protect nature, there is no appropriate
national legislation.
The Greek industrial areas of
Athens, Salonika and Patrasso already
show symptoms of acute contamina¬
tion. The coastal region near Athens,
for example, is seriously threatened.
In Sweden, the problem of man's
impact on nature has been appreciated
for a long time. Since the end of the
last century scientists and technicians
have been concerned with the study
of ecology, of contamination and its
elimination. Using the results of this
research and by suitable legislation,
many of the problems of the conta¬
mination of the environment have been
solved.
Atmospheric pollution is a negligible
problem in Iceland where power is
normally provided by electricity or
géothermie vapour which is readily
available in this volcanic island. The
fish-packing and fish oil industries
create problems due to fumes and
odours, but natural meteorological
conditions and winds help to offset
these effects. Water pollution is
mostly thermal and laws exist which
forbid the discharge of water at tem¬
peratures exceeding 30 to 35 degrees
centigrade.
Water pollution is the chief problem
in the Netherlands and here an inter¬
national aspect is involved. In fact,
70 per cent of the water in the Dutch
river network comes from other
countries and is thus already heavily
polluted. The waters of the Rhine, for
example, now show such an increase
in chlorides that they are unsuitable
for desalting the polders. These

Every year, 48,000 million cans, 28,000 million
bottles, 100 million tyres and 7 million cars
are discarded in the United States alone.
Right, like some malignant idol, this rusting
hulk stares blankly out from one of the
many car cemeteries that litter the countryside
of the industrialized world. Occasionally the
skeletal remains of bicycles, above, serve on
as makeshift barriers, and unwanted car
bodies are submerged off our coasts, acting
as artificial reefs that attract lobsters and
other marine life within easy reach of the
fisherman, below.

'WOODMAN, SPARE THAT TREE.' Since the Middle Ages entire forests have been
destroyed in Europe to satisfy an insatiable demand for timber and to obtain land for farming
or pasture. In 1 962, the world market needed 1 ,000 million cubic metres of wood. By 1 985 this
figure will have doubled. But by that date wood production, if kept within non-destructive limits,
will be only 1,000 million cubic metres. Trees and vegetation protect the soil and regulate
the flow of water. In Italy, where forests have been destroyed over the centuries, erosion has
caused tremendous damage. The river Arno, for example, carries twenty-six million quintals
of earth to the sea every year. The catastrophic floods of November 1966 which devastated
northern Italy and destroyed many of Florence's priceless art treasures (see the Unesco Courier,
January 1967) brought vividly home the dangers of unplanned deforestation. Experts estimate
that 8.6 million acres of land need replanting with trees in Italy to prevent the recurrence of
such disasters. It has been shown that the flood risks are 30 to 50 percent less in completely
wooded areas than in areas where only one third of the land is wooded. Erosion of soil resulting
from deforestation in turn affects plant life. In the Swiss canton of Argovia alone nearly
400 species of plant have disappeared since the beginning of the 19th century.
chlorides are of mineral origin and are
dumped into the river in the coal
mining areas of the Ruhr, Emscher and
Lippe where saline water is pumped
from the mines.
In Italy industry is concentrated In
certain regions and, like the urban
areas, is developing chaotically since
there is virtually no planning in this
field. Household and industrial liquid
waste is dumped into waters without
any purifying treatment. As a result
streams, rivers, lakes and coastline,
and the environment in general, have
deteriorated rapidly. In the whole of
Italy there are only thirty-two purifica¬
tion plants one plant for every
thousand communities and these are
mostly too small to be effective.
Motor traffic and domestic and indus¬
trial smoke contribute to the production
of smog in certain areas.
The deterioration of the environment
concerns everybody. Its prevention
requires the arousing of public opinion
and the active participation of all
citizens as well as co-operation at the
international level.
Economic incentives can be used
to protect the environment. Tax
benefits could, for instance, be granted
to industry for the construction of
waste treatment plant. Similarly,
heavy fines could be levied on those
industries which discharge untreated
waste liable to pollute the environment.
In any case, governments must
harmonize economic measures so asto
place industry in all countries on an
equitable competitive basis.
The true solution lies, above all, in
prevention. It would be desirable, for
example, in every allocation of funds
for new industrial construction, to
require part of the capital (2 to 3 per
cent) to be set aside for conservation
of the environment.
Pollution Is part of the price we pay
for our modern society. Nobody
knows its total cost because it is
spread over the whole social structure
and has never been examined in
isolation. The damage to health, both
physical and mental, to plant and
animal life, to the aesthetic qualities
of our natural surroundings, to the
artistic value of buildings and objects,
cannot readily be estimated.
We shall soon have to face the
problem of finding room for the waste
products that result from the bad
management of our technological
society because they are about to
submerge us. In our effort to im¬
prove living conditions it will certainly
be more economical to use pre¬
ventative methods from the outset
rather than look for ways of cleaning
up the environment when pollution is
already widespread.

### 56922: The "Year of the whale"

THE YEAR

by Howard Brabyn
T
HE moot point is whether
Leviathan can long endure so wide
a chase and so remarkable a havoc;
whether he must not at last be exter¬
minated from the waters, and the last
whale, like the last man, smoke his last
pipe and then himself evaporate in the
final puff."
These prophetic words of Herman
Melville, the author of "Moby Dick"
and himself an experienced harpoonist,
strike home uncomfortably in a decade
which may see the final extinction of
the blue whale, the largest mammal
ever to inhabit this world.
In thirty years the total blue whale
population of the world's oceans has
dropped from 100,000 to 1,000. Four
other species of whale are now being
caught at a rate faster than they can
reproduce.
This is but one more example of
man's incredible failure to respect the
ecological system of which he is a part
and his wanton destruction of the
world's natural assets that have served
him so well In the past.
We have only to consider the pro¬
ducts that man derives from whales to
realize how misguided it is to permit
the overfishing of these valuable
beasts. For centuries whale oil lit
men's homes, whale meat provided an

YEAR OF THE WHALE (Continued)
Certain species on the road to extinction
Important source of food, and whale¬
bone, inserted in women's corsets,
moulded women's figures to conform
to the dictates of fashion.
In more modern times whale oil is
used in the quenching and rolling of
steel, as an extreme pressure lubricant,
for the dressing of leather, in the manu¬
facture of soap and candles; whale
meat meal is used for cattle cake and
poultry food, frozen whalemeat is
widely eaten by humans, especially in
Japan; bone meal and guano, meat
extracts and liver oil rich in vitamin A
are other by-products; ambergis is
still of importance in perfumery and
whalebone is still used for corsets
and for bristles on industrial brushes.
The vast size of whales (a blue whale
can measure up to 100 ft in length and
weigh as much as 176 tons or roughly
the equivalent of 2,000 men) has
always aroused human curiosity and
given rise to a wealth of legends
from the adventures of Jonah in the
Bible to. Herman Melville's Moby Dick.
Writers from classical times, such as
Aristotle and Pliny, wrote of the
smaller whales, the dolphins, who were
considered to be the friends of man,
and there are many tales of tame dol¬
phins who carried boys upon their
backs. Among Spanish and Portu¬
guese fishermen there is a persistent
belief that dolphins attack sharks and
drive them away.
Stone Age man probably hunted the
smaller whales and dolphins. Eskimos
and American Indians are known to
have gone whaling with primitive wea
pons made of horn, flint and slate.
One Alaskan whaling settlement cer¬
tainly dated back to 100 or 200 A.D.
The Alaskan Eskimos' whale cult
dance indicates how important the
whale was in their lives. Before sett¬
ing out on a whaling expedition a week
would be spent in ritual dance with a
woman taking the part of the whale;
during the hunt, incantations were
made and songs sung; after a success¬
ful hunt the Shaman, or high priest,
would lead the dance of rejoicing; this
would be followed by a 3 day "mourn¬
ing" period of placation, after which
came a final feast accompanied by
frenzied dancing.
Modern whaling methods really date
from the 1860s, when a Norwegian
sealing captain, Svend Foyn, invented
a new technique for hunting the great
rorquals, including the blue whale,
which swim too fast for pursuit in open
boats. He fitted a harpoon-firing
cannon in the bows of a steam vessel
and incorporated into the harpoon
head a grenade which exploded a few
seconds after the harpoon had pene¬
trated the whale's body. Foyn's
methods revolutionized whaling and
have remained essentially unaltered to
this day.
The next big change in whaling came
in 1925, when the steamship "Lanc¬
ing" was fitted with a slipway in the
stern by means of which whales could
be hauled aboard. This marked the
beginning of the factory ship era and
opened the way to pelagic (open sea)
whaling.
Factory ships could operate for long
periods wherever whales were to be
found and outside territorial waters in
which regulations to curb overfishing
were gradually being imposed.
Delivered to the factory ship by a
whale catcher, the huge carcass is
winched up the slipway to the flensing
(butchering) deck where the blubber is
removed in enormous strips and the
meat removed and the carcass dis¬
membered. It takes little more than
45 minutes to dispose of a 100 ton
blue whale.
For a time pelagic whaling was un¬
restricted, but it soon became evident
that blue whales and humpback whales
were being seriously overfished. In
1937 and 1938 the governments of
Great Britain, Norway and Germany
signed agreements to restrict pelagic
whaling and in 1946 the International
Whaling Commission was set up which
most whaling nations joined.
The Commission lays down minimum
lengths for whales that may be caught,
limits the duration of the whaling sea¬
son for the different species, allocates
areas outside the Antarctic in which
factory ships may operate and has
named a sanctuary area in the Antarc¬
tic which can be opened or closed
to whalers at its discretion. Whaling
for humpback whales was completely
forbidden in 1963 and for blue whales
in 1964.
Many experts, however, consider
that existing regulations for the control
of whaling are still inadequate. In
his remarkable book "The Year of the
Whale (1)," biologist Victor B. Schef-
fer has called for much stronger Inter¬
national action. He would like to see
control of whaling placed in the hands
of the United Nations and firm action
taken before certain species of whale
become entirely extinct.
His pleading is based on sound com¬
mon sense. "If we think of whales, not
as unique systems, but as packages
of oil and protein, we can get along
nicely without them," he says. He
points out that we could instead gather
the sea forJder on which they live, but,
"it will not come to us in the whole¬
sale, bargain size of the fifty ton
whale."
"The Year of the Whale" is a fic¬
tionalized account of the first year in
the life of a sperm whale, interspersed
with absorbing facts about the biology
of the whale, the whale at play, its
ability to pick up the "tingling mes¬
sages" of vibrations and interpret
them, the whaling industry and all the
folklore and mysticism that surrounds
the whale.

knack of presenting hard biological
facts in terms of sheer poetry as wit¬
ness this description of a female
sperm whale diving to the ocean
depths to feed.
"Too long she has dozed in the
winter sun, only inches under the sur¬
face of the sea. She sighs. She
draws a dozen deep drafts of air and
then she turns below. Her tail flashes
against the blue. She does not sink,
she undulates, she presses firmly
down. Her heartbeat drops to ten per
minute, barely thumping, slow, pump¬
ing five gallons at a stroke. The blood
retreats from limbs and skin and tail;
it keeps alive the massive brain and
heart. The red-black muscles of her
flesh begin to pour their hidden stores
of oxygen into her veins. Now the mas¬
sive beds of fat begin to serve. Their
spongy, oily cells relax and offer up
their air. The pressure grows. She
continues down. Her body goes in
debt for exygen, but not for long. A
trillion cells suspend, they tolerate,
they hold. For half an hour she feeds
and then she pushes to the top to
breathe. Her lungs are clean and
fresh; their walls are thin. In sweet
abandon she sucks the upper air all
pure and unpolluted. Her breath is a
rustling sound like surf on a smooth
beach a soft sighing music of the
wind. It is a sound like no other on
the sea. She has fed two thousand
feet below and yet survives."
In passages such as this Scheffer
succeeds in imparting to us the won¬
der of a sadly depleted life system.
Before depletion becomes extinction
and before the genetic pool of our
ecosystem is further reduced we must
surely listen to the voice of reason and
act to preserve this branch of our own
family of mammals.
In their ancient whale cult dance
the Alaskan eskimos were instinctively
aware of this and marked the death of
a whale with a "mourning" period.
Unless we act immediately the mourn¬
ing period will become unending.
As Albert Schweitzer wrote in his
autobiography; "...man comes again
and again into the position of being
able to preserve his own life only at
the cost of other life. If he has been
touched by the ethic of Reverence for
Life, he injures and destroys life only
under a necessity which he cannot
avoid, and never from thoughtlessness.
So far as he is a free man he uses
every opportunity of tasting the bles¬
sedness of being able to assist life and
avert from it suffering and destruc¬
tion."

Letters to the Editor
TRIUMPH ON THE MOON
HUNGER ON EARTH
Sir,
Your issue on the fruit of space
research (March 1970) was a great
achievement, and the examples given
by the author, Gene Gregory are most
impressive.
However, while reading the "Unesco
Courier" I received another publication
in which the Irish National Freedom
from Hunger Campaign Committee
states "While Apollo II stood on the
moon, 36,550 died from hunger on
earth." This is also an impressive and
challenging fact. Since it was not
stated in Mr. Gregory's article, I think
you should pass it on to your readers.

MAN THE PREDATOR
.Sir,
As a regular reader of your magazine
I know that most of its articles deal
with great problems and developments
in the world. However, I would like to
ask you to devote space to a problem
that is of special concern to me the
protection of animals.
I know this is a difficult, thankless
and often misunderstood effort which,
as is often pointed out, takes but
second place to the solution of the
formidable problems facing Man. But
surely we can devote some of our
resources to putting an end to the
sufferings of helpless animals, so fre¬
quently a prey to the cruelty and
ignorance of men.

The protection of animals and nature
has been a constant concern of the
"Unesco Courier' during the last
22 years. Issues devoted to this
problem include: "Man Against Nature"
(January 1958), "Africa's Wildlife in
Peril" (September 1961), 'Sanctuaries
Astride Frontiers" (February 1965) and
"The Biosphere, a delicate balance
between man and nature' (January 1969)
and of course the present issue Editor.
CLASS PROJECT 'UNESCO'
Sir.
Last week my class arranged an" in¬
teresting exhibition on Unesco, using
posters and booklets with illustrations
and articles on many Unesco activities,
particularly International Education Year
1970. Copies of the different language
editions of the "Unesco Courier" were
prominently featured.
Our teacher devoted a lesson to
explaining the structure, work and pro¬
gramme of Unesco. I myself prepared
the talk under the title "Unesco, What
it is, What it does, How it works".

IGNORANCE ABOUT CANCER
Sir,
Your informative articles on smoking
and cancer (May 1970) fail to make
clear whether or not the inhaling of
tobacco smoke makes any difference.
This is surely a vital factor.
One of your authors seems to be
surprised at the public's ignorance of
cancer cures. Ask 100 persons and
I'm sure no one will have had any first¬
hand knowledge of a cured case.
People with cancer tend to hide it;
doctors are bound by professional
secrecy. Cancer cures should be
widely publicized in non-specialist
journals with a wide readership.
Guy Marquis
Douai, France
The World Health Organization reports
to us that smokers who inhale have a
much greater chance of getting cancer
than those who don't inhale by far.
It has not yet been definitely established
why pipe and cigar smoking are less
harmful than cigarettes. Two hypo¬
theses have been advanced by medical
experts: that pipe and cigar smokers
inhale less and that they are inclined
also to smoke less Editor.
A LITTLE SCARY..
Sir,
Your issue on Cancer is most in¬
teresting. A little scary too. I find after
reading it an ashtray full of half-smoked
cigarettes. As I write I'm taking solace
in a large cigar. But more seriously...
have any studies been undertaken
amongst people of an urban Parsee
community say Bombay? Such a stu¬
dy could be revealing. With fire a
sacred thing, most Parsees don't smoke,
although some younger ones do; but
smokers or not they live in a city much
polluted by the exhausts of cars, buses
and trucks.

WHY TORTURE RABBITS?
Sir,
The harmful, cancer-producing effects
of tobacco on the lungs ("Unesco Cou¬
rier", May 1970) have long been estab¬
lished beyond any doubt by statistics
covering many hundreds of thousands
of people. So why torture rabbits by
making them smoke through masks
placed over their muzzles? (photograph
in your May 1970 issue) Why continue
to inflict cancer upon them? Although
one cannot oppose all experimentation
on animals, it must be admitted that
the limits of what is strictly necessary
are exceeded again and. again in order
to satisfy cruel scientific curiosity.

FRESCOES OF PAESTUM
Sir.
The article in your April 1970 issue
concerning the archaeological discov¬
eries at Paestum contains a few errors.
In the caption on page 3 referring
to the cover photo you say: "the fresco
reproduced in the upper half of our
cover depicts a warrior being welcomed
home... The standard indicates that this
is a Lucanian work as the ancient
Greeks never carried standards."
In fact, the warrior in question is
carrying the tunic and belt of the
defeated enemy. This is clearly visible
in the fresco. Furthermore, it was not
the custom in Greece to bring back
the vanquished enemy's tunic displayed
like a standard.
The caption on page 4 concerning
the temple at Paestum describes it as
being "modelled on the Parthenon".
However, it has been definitely estab¬
lished that the Parthenon at Athens
was built later than the temple at
Paestum and with different aesthetic
considerations in mind. See P. Zancani-
Monturo, "Enciclopedia deH'Arte Antica"
(page 836) and F. Krauss, "Paestum,
Die Griechischen Tempel" (page 47).

THE DISAPPEARING WHALE
Sir,
I should like to comment on the letter
from J. A. Gulland and S. J. Holt of
FAO published in your November 1969
issue. The present plight of the
Balaenoptera Borealis (the Sei whale)
is much more serious than their letter
indicates. The FAO report for 1966-67
recorded a 30 per cent reduction in the
number of whales in the Antarctic as
compared with the previous year. In
1965-66, 17,583 were killeda third of
the overall population. The position of
the Balaenoptera Musculus (the Blue
whale) is almost hopeless. A report of
the International Union for the Conser¬
vation of Nature and Natural Resources
put the total number of Blue whales at
between 650 and 1,950 in 1963. The
report added: "It is probable that the
Blue whale has reached the point at
which it will no longer be able to repro¬
duce."

COVER CHARGE
Sir,
It is always a pleasure to receive
your magazine which I leave in the
sitting room for everyone to look at and
read. However my pleasure will dimin¬
ish if you continue the present un-
engaging style of your covers.
It is of course right to move with,
or even ahead of the times, but as
the "Unesco Courier" aims at being a
link between a great number of different
mentalities, only truly beautiful or hu¬
manly striking designs can hope to
have this unifying effect. In the past
the "Courier" has very seldom been
amiss in this. So I ardently hope the
last few issues are not indicative of
a permanent new line in "Courier"
covers.

Preserving
Cambodia's monuments
Following a recent Unesco Executive Board
resolution calling for efforts "to preserve
the monuments of Cambodia's cultural heri¬
tage from destruction, profanation and pil¬
lage", Unesco's Director General, Mr. René
Maheu has held consultations with the
countries involved. At the request of
Cambodia, he sent Mr. Vadime Elisseef,
chief curator of the Cernuschi Museum in
Paris, to Phnom Penh, to advise on the
application of the Hague Convention for
the protection of cultural property in
wartime.
Stethoscopes on the
Great Lakes
The international Field Year for the Great
Lakes, a comprehensive programme of
scientific studies of Lake Ontario and its
drainage basin, will begin in 1972. It Is
a joint US-Canadian undertaking and part
of the two countries' national programmes
for the Unesco sponsored International
Hydrological Decade. The Field Year will
directly benefit the 35 million North Amer¬
icans now living on the shores of the
Great Lakes, one of which, Lake Erie, is
already seriously polluted. By the end
of the century the number of lakeside
dwellers is expected to reach 70 million.
Making Singapore a cleaner
greener city
Smoky vehicles are to be eliminated
from Singapore by the end of 1970 so
that the Republic can be a "cleaner, gree¬
ner city. . ." Measures in the government
anti-pollution drive include : liquidation of
bus companies involved in 30 pollution
offences in a month and transfer of their
business to another company with a good
record; banning the belching of smoke and
fumes from vehicles; setting up a perma¬
nent three-man committee to look into pol¬
lution problems; a law to prohibit smoking
in cinemas and buses.
Lowering barriers
to knowledge
The latest teaching equipment from
abroad will become more easily available
to schools thanks to a Unesco-sponsored
convention for its temporary importation
recently approved in Brussels by the Cus¬
toms Co-operation Council. Material co¬
vered for classroom use, for training the
handicapped and for vocational courses
includes programmed teaching equipment,
language libraries, closed-circuit television
equipment, mobile libraries and study kits.
Passports for art treasures
Recognized art treasures and other cul¬
tural property will in future need their own
"passports" to leave their country of ori¬
gin if an international convention directed
against illegal traffic in works of art is
approved by Unesco's General Conference
in October 1970. Approved recently by a
committee of specialists representing
60 countries, the control convention would
require ratifying states to issue a certifi¬
cate for each item of cultural property
exported.
New power source
for heart pace-makers
A revolutionary type of pace-maker for
ailing hearts is being developed by the
Australian Atomic Energy Commission.
Unlike pace-makers currently in use, which
are powered by mercury batteries, its
power source is the radioactive element
Promethium 147. It is one third the size
of existing models, and has a life of
10 years compared to less than three.
Computers vs. pollution
Rotterdam, second biggest city of the
Netherlands, has completed the first phase
of the world's most sophisticated, fully
automated air pollution warning system. It
consists of 31 electric "sniffers" sited near
major industrial plants to monitor sulphur
dioxide in the atmosphere. They are iïhked
to a computer, and when sulphur dioxide
in the air rises above a certain level, the
computer sounds an alarm and an elec¬
tronic map pinpoints the offending plant.
Site of Socrates'
trial unearthed
The ruins of the Stoa of the Basileus,
where Socrates was tried and condemned
to death has been unearthed by archaeo¬
logists excavating in the heart of Athens.
Remnants of the stone benches on which
some of Socrates' judges may have sat
have also been found.
Protecting the
African environment
Unesco is to provide assistance in eco¬
logy and conservation to African countries
through the Unesco Field Science Office
for Africa in Nairobi. Kai Curry Lindahl,
a well-known Swedish conservationist,
and Dr. Hartmut Walter, a German zoolo¬
gist, have been sent to Nairobi to help
set up national parks and biological res¬
erves and to advise on the protection of
archaeological sites.
Flashes...
M Cars,' trucks and buses in the U.S.A.
will increase from 104 million to 158 million
within the next 20 years according to the
U.S. Federal Highways Administration.
M "Consumer Education" was the theme
of this year's World Consumer Conference
held at Baden, near Vienna, in support of
International Education Year 1970.
M An international youth camp organized
by the Japanese Committee of the World
Assembly of Youth was held at the Osaka
World Fair in July.
Pakistan is to open ten new vocational
education institutes for women, including
a polytechnic centre at Karachi offering
courses in radio electronics, commercial
education and dress designing.

ANTI-SLICK BARRAGE
After the wreck of the tanker "Torrey Canyon" in March 1967, hastily improvised booms consisting of floats
and cables, like this one at St. Ives in Cornwall, formed a protective skirt around Britain's south western
coastline, rising and falling with the tides and holding back the oil slicks that threatened to invade beaches,
ports and river estuaries. More sophisticated booms consisting of tough, easily assembled plastic sections,
now provide a cheaper and more effective weapon against the growing menace of beach pollution by crude oil.
