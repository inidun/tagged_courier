Mystery sculpture
This terra-cotta statuette is a mystery. The first of a series of figurines, all feminine,
found in the Niger valley between Bamako and Mopti, it is probably the work of a
Mandingo sculptor of the late 14th or early 15th century. From the 13th to the 16th
century, the Mandingo people controlled a large empire centred on what is now
the Republic of Mali. The meaning and purpose of these Mandingo statuettes is not
known, but no one can deny that this one has a plaintive melancholy and sad beauty.
It is now in the Institut Fondamental d'Afrique Noire, in Dakar (Senegal).

THE JIGSAW PUZZLE OF DRUGS
The United Nations and particularly its Commission on Narcotic Drugs have
developed a broad international system to control the production and legal use
of narcotic drugs and set up operations to check illicit traffic. The World Health
Organization has for years carried out international programmes on health
aspects of the drug question. Now Unesco has joined this concerted U.N.
effort (see box page 21). The illustrations on our front and back covers
and on next page are from a booklet on LSD published by the U.S. Bureau
of Narcotic^-anüb^Dangerous Drugs.

### 50899: UNESCO joins the U.N. world fight against drugs
world fight
against drugs
uNESCO has taken the first steps in a long-term pro¬
gramme designed to combat drug abuse through education,
social science research and information. The programme,
it is hoped, will contribute to the concerted international
effort against the misuse of drugs launched by the U.N.
and its Specialized Agencies.
Unesco's approach to the problem was outlined by the
Assistant Director-general for Education, Amadou-Mahtar
M'Bow, when he addressed teachers, doctors, psychia¬
trists and social workers from 19 countries at a recent
Unesco meeting called to examine the role of education in
preventing drug abuse.
"Unesco neither looks upon drugs
as a specific problem of youth", he said
"nor does it consider that the many
serious problems facing youth in the
world today all bear a direct relation to
drug-taking as such. The use of educa¬
tional techniques as a weapon against
drugs should therefore be aimed at both young people and
adults."
The alarming increase in the misuse of drugs, he pointed
out, is often attributed to new factors linked to present-day
development in certain societies: the urban explosion,
growing acceptance of "consumer society" values, the
glorification of violence, social inequalities of all kinds,
the generation gap and the malaise affecting certain sec¬
tors of the youth population.
Unesco's inquiry showed that the problem of drug abuse
has increased ominously during the past few years. Grow¬
ing cause for concern is seen in the availability of a wide
variety of drugs and changes in the pattern of drug-taking.
.From being an escape route for certain adults, it has
spread alarmingly to young people in all levels of society;
from being the practice of a loner it has become a group
activity, from cases of addiction to a single drug, it has
become increasingly a problem of multiple addiction, with
a switch evident from minor drugs to major ones or the
use of several drugs at once.
Unesco's inquiry reveals two particularly disturbing
trends: the "epidemic" spread "of the drug habit and the
growing hold it has taken on younger persons, even
children.
Thus, surveys at the University of Maryland (U.S.A.)
showed that 15 per cent of students used marijuana in
1967, about 24 per cent in 1968 and about 36 per cent in
1969. In the U,K. in 1964, only 40 known drug addicts
were under 20 years old; in 1966, they numbered 329,
most of them heroin addicts. In France, between 1946 and
1949, a census of drug consumers included only one aged
under 20; in 1971, 90 per cent of nearly 1,900 consumers
arrested were under 25. In Costa Rica, ten years ago,
marijuana was an adult habit; now it has spread to 14 and
15 year-olds.
All the countries studied allow the production of drugs
only for medical purposes and most forbid cultivation of the
opium poppy, the coca bush and the cannabis plant. Use
and possession of drugs are also largely prohibited, but
not uniformly.
Penalties for drug offences vary. Drug
traffickers risk up to ten years'
imprisonment in Britain, France and the
Federal Republic of Germany, six years
in Denmark and Brazil, five years in
Jamaica and three years in Costa Rica.
In the U.S. a drug pedlar may be jailed
for life. Iran and Nigeria provide the death penalty for
drug producers.
Drug abusers are punished in most of the countries
covered by the Unesco inquiry, although it notes that
"infliction of penalties on drug users has not only proved
everywhere to be ineffective... it has even aggravated the
problem."
We should not overlook the fact, Unesco states in its
report, that in present-day societies, adults use and abuse
various "drugs" and especially pleasure-producing sub¬
stances or those which relieve anxieties due to the tensions
inherent in modern life. Coffee, tobacco and alcohol are
seen as daily essentials, we take amphetamines to stay
.awake and barbiturates to go to sleep, as well as various
"shock-absorbers" against the stress of daily life.
The latest report, in March 1973, of the U.S. Commis¬
sion on Marijuana and Drug Abuse termed chronic alco¬
holism "without question the most serious drug problem in
the United States today." While calling for severe punish¬
ment of drug traffickers, it urged greater emphasis on treat¬
ment rather than penalties for drug abusers and called for
a new approach to the whole problem. (See box page 20.)
As WHO reported in a pamphlet entitled "Youth and
Drugs", just published in Geneva, "The responses of society
to the non-medical use of dependence-producing drugs will
depend on how its individual members and institutions per¬
ceive the problems associated with such use. These per¬
ceptions and subsequent responses will also be much
influenced by prevailing attitudes and beliefs about (1)
why people take drugs; (2) the immediate and delayed
effects of doing so; and (3) certain aspects of the society's
broad value system."
A Working Group was recently convened by the WHO
Regional Office for Europe to explore "Measures for the
Prevention and Control of Drug Abuse and Dependence."
Referring to the educational approach to the problem, the
Working Group noted: "The risks from ill-considered health
education programmes for school-children may outweigh
the benefits if too sensational an approach glamorizes,
and increases morbid interest in the subject Programmes
should be judged by their effects and not by the intentions
of their sponsors."
This is, in effect, what Unesco set out to do in the inter¬
national inquiry it carried out on the prevention of drug
abuse by education and information.

To teach
or not
to teach?
Should education about drugs be
introduced into the curriculum?
Results of a Unesco international inquiry
lI N 1971 and 1972 Unesco carried out an
international inquiry to find out what role education should play and
actually is playing to combat the growing problem of drug abuse today.
The inquiry covered fourteen countries, two in Asia (India, Iran),
two in Africa (Nigeria, Senegal), six in Europe (Denmark, France, Fed.
Rep. of Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, U.K.), and four in the Americas
(Brazil, Costa Rica, Jamaica, U.S.A.).
The Unesco inquiry was not limited to education in schools; the
broad questionnaire sent to Unesco Member States included questions
on the role of the information media and the social sciences.
Unesco has just issued two preliminary reports which contain an
analysis of the replies received, the first entitled "Patterns of Drug-
taking and Official Policies"; the second, "Prevention of Drug Abuse
by Education and the Mass Media". The articles below and on page
12 are based on the findings of the latter study. The results of an
inquiry into the controversial question of the harmfulness of cannabis
based on the first-mentioned study are presented on page 23.
6
F the 14 countries covered
by Unesco's international inquiry, nine
(Brazil, Denmark, the Federal Republic
of Germany, India, Jamaica, Sweden,
Switzerland, the United Kingdom and
the United States) favour a drugs edu¬
cation policy in schools, universities
and out-of-school education. All
these countries have initiated some
form of drugs education, and India is
preparing a large-scale project.
Among the five other countries, two
(Nigeria and Senegal) expressed no
opinion on the value of drugs educa¬
tion. Costa Rica indicated that no
action had been undertaken apart from
the distribution of information leaflets
in secondary schools and that no par¬
ticular measures are envisaged by the
Ministry of Education. The Costa
Rican Ministry of Public Health, how¬
ever, replied that it was in favour of a
policy of drugs education within the
school system and elsewhere.
The remaining countries (Iran and
France) are opposed to introducing
specific instruction on the abuse and
characteristics of the different drugs
into school programmes.
Iran's position is that "in order not
to attract the attention of young peo¬
ple, and in view of existing social
conditions, it is wiser for the moment
not to include in school programmes an
open campaign against the use of
drugs. In many of the remoter parts
of Iran even the names of heroin and
morphine are, fortunately, still un¬
known. The mere fact of talking about
them could provoke among the young
an urge to indulge in drugs, if only for
fun or out of curiosity." (See also foot¬
note page 14.)
The French attitude to the question
is less clear-cut, but reflects the same
fear of talking too much about drugs
and thus inciting young people to
experiment. A 1971, Ministry of Edu¬
cation circular on "the fight against
drug addiction in institutions of higher
education and in schools" urges the
heads of such establishments to show
"vigilance and discernment". It calls
for preventive action, help for drug-
addicts and protection of the school
against drug-pushers coupled with the
general policy of keeping school doc¬
tors, parents and teachers informed.
For the time being no specific edu¬
cation programme is envisaged in
France. Courses on drugs and the dis¬
tribution of explanatory leaflets are
both considered undesirable and direct
action is advised only when absolutely
essential. Excessive publicity, it is
felt, might well encourage the spread
of drug-taking.
However, the French reply mentions
a project for civic, health and social
education intended for third and fourth
year secondary pupils which would
include some information on drugs. It
is feared that a course entirely devoted
to drugs might have harmful effects.
Being autonomous, French universi¬
ties are free to introduce lectures on
drug abuse, though "this is a problem
which preoccupies students far less
than is generally believed". But edu¬
cation for teachers and opinion-makers
is foreseen.
Countries which favour education
against drug abuse realize that young
people, through their own grapevines,
get hold of a great deal of informa¬
tion, some of which is true, some
partially true and some false. Surveys
show that an increasing number of
young people have experimented with
various drugs and that an even greater
number are exposed to the temptation
to experiment.
Yet agreement in principle to the
need for education is always coupled
with reservations due to the fear of

saying too much, of saying it badly, of
stimulating an already active interest
in drugs among young people by ill-
considered remarks from teachers who
themselves are not well-informed on
the problem. All these reservations
concern what methods to use and their
effectiveness which is extremely diffi¬
cult to assess since so far no evalua¬
tion of programmes and different types
of action has been made.
Unesco's inquiry shows that coun
tries which favour education for drug
prevention tend to adopt two main
approaches: to put the young on their
guard against drugs, and to eliminate
the aura of drama that surrounds
drugs.
In support of the first approach it is
argued that young people receive one¬
sided information on drugs from unoffi¬
cial sources (fellow-students, maga¬
zines, drug-addicts, etc.) which stress
the pleasures of drug-taking while
saying almost nothing about its dan¬
gers. The young must therefore be
told about the risks of drug abuse if
a change of attitude is to be brought
about.
The second approach sets out to dis¬
pel the magic aura, the romantic and
fascinating aspect of drugs, which may
well account for the attraction they hold
for the younger generation. Much of the
drama would be taken out of drug edu¬
cation, and thus out of drugs them-

TO TEACH OR NOT TO TEACH? (Continued)
selves, if it formed an integral part of
the school curriculum, given as part
of a health instruction class sand¬
wiched between classes on mathe¬
matics and languages.
A warning taken from a United
Kingdom health instruction manual
stresses that the subject of drug-
taking' "should not be handled in such
a way as to lend it glamour or to
encourage its concealment... It should
be discussed in the proper context as.
an aspect of health education." This
view is shared by the United States,
the Federal Republic of Germany, Den¬
mark and Sweden.
All these countries emphasize the
need for objectivity in presenting infor¬
mation to students and to young peo¬
ple generally. Denmark, for instance,
maintains that the first principle is that
"all education should be as truthful as
possible."
A manual for teachers published in
the United States quotes the following
example: "If 20 per cent of the stu
dents in a classroom of 50 have used
a drug, there are at least 10 students
carefully measuring the teacher's
words against empirical knowledge.
At least 30 students will know the
10 as users and be briefed by them.
With 40 of the audience of 50 in a
good position to judge the accuracy
of a teacher's statement about a drug
he has probably never tried, any dis¬
crepancies will be quickly noted and
used to breed distrust of the total
presentation."
And the manual adds that "the
'why it's dangerous to use drugs'
approach is likely to make any teen¬
agers feel that if they haven't tried
drugs they're missing something."
In almost all countries where educa¬
tional campaigns have either been
launched or are in preparation the
initiative has come from government
organizations operating on a national
scale.
Thus, in the United States, the Drug
Abuse Education Act of 1970 aims "to
encourage the development of new
and improved curricula on the prob¬
lems of drug abuse; to demonstrate
the use of such curricula in model
educational programmes and to eval¬
uate their effectiveness; to dissemi¬
nate curricular materials and signifi¬
cant information for use in educational
programmes throughout the nation; to
provide training programmes for
teachers, counsellors, law enforce¬
ment officials, and other public service
and community leaders; and to offer
community education programmes for
parents and others, on drug abuse
problems."
The Act also sets out in detail the
different fields of application of this
education policy. The directives and
plan of action communicated by the
United States originate from federal
agencies. The National Clearing
House for Mental Health Information, a
branch of the National Institute of
Public Health, is the main agency for
the assembly and dissemination of
8
UNITED STATES: A broad range of comprehensive educational
programmes against drug abuse have been drawn up in the U.S.A.
Only a small sampling is given here (see also article page 13).
Among the countries which replied to Unesco's Inquiry, only
the U.S. reported action at the pre-school level. Most of the
programmes for the very young begin in the kindergarten; for
example, a painting album, such as "Katy's Colouring Book about
Drugs and Health" (published by the Bureau of Narcotics and
Dangerous Drugs, Guide for teachers and parents), is used in
discussions on the place of medicines In the life of children. The
main theme is: only sick people need medicines.
Another programme of the same type suggests that teachers
should.
get children into the habit of asking parents or other respon¬
sible adults before eating or drinking anything new;
make them aware that some everyday items may be harmful
if used improperly.
The methods recommended in the "model" lesson are active
methods: games, such as "We Ask First"; or dramatic play,
such as "The Day Baby Got Sick"; the making of individual
safety scrapbooks which each child shows to his parents for
their comments and evaluation. Transparent prints and slides
are also available.
Warnings against the abuse of medicaments and drugs are
generally given in a full course on physical health and mental
hygiene. Children should learn the value of good health and
"what their healthy bodies can do so they will appreciate them".
A large number of comprehensive programmes have been drawn
up by different States:
èl three series of programmes go from kindergarten to senior
high school inclusive;
two others are intended for grades 4, 5, and 6, and for grades
6 to 12.
Most of the programmes include a statement of the basic orien¬
tations and of the psychological and moral principles underlying
them which can be summed up in three main points:
Instruction on drugs should hinge naturally on some school
subject (according to the level, on health education, biology, or
the social sciences).
Health education should stimulate the young to have more
positive motivations with regard to themselves (a sense of physi¬
cal and mental health), to others, and to society as a whole (the
urge to play a social role, to take part in the life of the community
and assume responsibility towards it).
Confronted with numerous sources of information, young people
should learn to sort out for themselves the data on a given
subject (in this instance drugs), to select the pertinent information
and make a decision. Particular emphasis should be given to
decision-making.
The programmes also include plans for model lessons that
cover objectives, time-tables, themes (with bibliographical refer¬
ences) and available audio-visual aids (filmstrips, slides, films,
pamphlets and folders, posters, etc.).
A great deal of audio-visual material is available including at
least seven 16 mm films suitable for junior and senior high
schools: "Are drugs the answer?", "A day in the death of Danny
B.", "Drugs and the nervous system" and "Hooked", among other
titles.
JAMAICA undertook a variety of activities during its "Beware
of Drugs" campaign, in which films, lectures and leaflets were
all used. Most of the material came from the United States.
Leaflets distributed by the Regional Centre for Technical Aid and
the Alliance for Progress include: "Narcotics: Some ' Questions
and Answers", "Marijuana: Some Questions and Answers", "The
Up and Down Drugs: Amphetamines and Barbiturates", "Barbi¬
turates as Addicting Drugs", "LSD: Questions Concerning Students
and thf Abuse of Drugs", "Living Death: the Truth About Drug
Addiction", "An American Father Speaks Frankly about Marijuana".

information concerning pedagogical
experiments undertaken at the local or
State level.
A number of courses are selected,
reproduced and sent on request to
schools and teachers. They carry no
recommendation as to their adoption
but are distributed as documentary
material to help schools undertake or
improve their general programme.
The National Clearing House also
circulates for the use of teachers,
research findings, bibliographies, film
listings and information leaflets on the
different drugs, as well as audio¬
visual aids to illustrate the courses.
More particularly, the Social Action
Office for Drug Abuse Prevention pro¬
vides up-to-date information on avail¬
able educational programmes, their
approach and their different fields of
application.
The Bureau of Narcotics and Danger¬
ous Drugs of the Federal Department
of Justice is also highly active in the
field of prevention but is less directly
specialized in educational matters. It
has, nevertheless, prepared a number
of programmes for study courses.
In the Federal Republic of Germany
prevention programmes are closely
supervised by the Federal Ministry of
Youth, the Family and Health. A num¬
ber of inter-ministerial working groups
are also active in the fight against the
misuse of drugs and the protection of
youth.
In addition, the Central Federal
Office for Health Information has
launched an extensive campaign of
prevention through education and
information. Because of the dearth of
qualified instructors, however, the in¬
clusion of teaching on drugs in school
curricula has been postponed. But as
a start, the Office is contacting those
who are well placed to pass on their
knowledge to a large public, particu¬
larly teachers, instructors, education¬
ists, youth movement leaders, social
workers and student representatives
on school administration councils. It
is planned to increase the number of
model seminars to provide rapid in¬
struction for all those engaged in
education.
The German Head Office for Com¬
batting the Dangers of Drug Addic¬
tion co-ordinates at the federal level
all activities, including the publication
and free distribution of written mat¬
erial, films and slides specially pre¬
pared for schools, youth movement
leaders, apprentices, etc.
In Switzerland, prevention program¬
mes are the responsibility of the
Cantonal educational authorities. Sev¬
eral Cantons have taken steps to in¬
troduce preventive educational pro¬
grammes, often as part of general
health instruction, and to co-ordinate
the activities of public and private or¬
ganizations. A large travelling exhibi¬
tion, intended for schoolchildren as
well as the general public, is now
visiting towns throughout the country.

COSTA RICA also draws largely on the same United States
material translated into Spanish. The Costa Rican Ministry
of Public Health also published, in 1970, a comprehensive
leaflet entitled "Marijuana, the Poison of Youth".
In general, the leaflets and colour folders are well presented
and sum up the main points about a particular drug: definition and
characteristics, physical and psychical effects, medical use, abuse
and consequences, physiological and psychical dependence, and,
where appropriate, the results of research and the addresses
of information or treatment centres. The information given is
objective and essentially factual.
THE UNITED KINGDOM: Like many other countries, including
the Fed. Rep. of Germany, the United Kingdom has not formulated
systematic programmes at this level. The only educational material
communicated by the U.K. is a pamphlet for teachers to accompany
a 23-mlnute educational film in colour, entitled "One Way Ticket".
This is a real-life story, adapted and designed for education
on the use of drugs in the modern world. Intended for 14 to
17 year-olds and based on the case histories of several young
people living in an industrial town, it provides a starting-point for
a discussion on the principal effects of cannabis, LSD, amphe¬
tamines, barbiturates and, to a lesser degree, heroin.
The accompanying pamphlet includes a guide for debate on
the film and on factors conducive to drug-taking and dependence.
It also describes a number of actual cases and makes suggestions
for further study.
9 SWEDEN: In Sweden, education on alcohol and other drugs
was provided for in schools as long ago as 1928. In fact, these
subjects were dealt with only to the extent that time permitted and
according to the interest of the individual teacher.
In 1962, the Swedish Parliament laid down new directives on
the teaching of different subjects. The only reference to alcohol,
drugs and tobacco was under intermediate level science in the
Grundskola (the Grundskola in Sweden provides nine years
compulsory education from 7 to 16, at elementary, intermediate
and higher levels).
Education on alcohol, tobacco and other drugs occupies a
prominent place in the new programmes adopted in 1970, the
aim being to give students "an education that enables them to
make independent and responsible decisions, both in principle
and in concrete choices, regarding their own use of things."
At the elementary level children can be taught about tobacco,
alcohol and, if such questions are in the news, the use of solvents
and drugs, during discussions regarding health, bodily functions,
social behaviour and habits.
"Using well-informed and detailed arguments, the school should
point out the positive value of total abstinence from alcohol and
tobacco first of all during the period of growth. It should also
be made clear that all use of drugs not prescribed by a doctor
spells danger and is contrary to the law," says a study published
by Sweden's National Board of Education.
At the intermediate and higher levels, it says, education should
be directed towards fields of interest in sociology and the natural
sciences. At the higher level opportunities should be found to
discuss behaviour and the results of scientific surveys on this
subject as well as the role of publicity in shaping attitudes.
Moreover, it is important that the school should co-operate
closely with parents and with representatives of the various
health institutions and agencies so as to reinforce what has been
learned at school.
DENMARK reports the use of several well-designed programmes
in schools. Education on drug abuse forms part of the health,
and later, the biology programme.
Educational television broadcasts have also been devoted to
the subject. A network of consultants and specialized teachers
has been organized so that information given out may be co¬
ordinated.

Sweden, the education programmes
are drawn up under the auspices of
the Ministry of Education, within the
framework either of a commission
studying the drug problem in general
(in Denmark, a commission on the
abuse of drugs by the young; in Swe¬
den, a committee for protection
against drug abuse) or of a special
council for health education (in the
United Kingdom, the Health Education
Council, set up in 1968).
In India, the National Council of
Educational Research and Training is
preparing an education project for
young people designed to prevent
drug abuse, particularly in secondary
schools, teacher-training schools and
centres and universities. It plans to
include an appropriate lesson in text¬
books when they are next revised.
In Costa Rica, the Ministry of Public
Health is contemplating an education
programme to be drawn up by the
Ministry of National Education. The
two ministries are to study whether
or not to include a special programme
in school and college programmes,
and how to prepare teachers and
parents to understand and accept this
teaching.
In Jamaica and Brazil, the sporadic
action so far taken in regard to school
and out-of-school drugs education has
not been directly initiated by the
Government.
Denmark, the Fed. Rep. of Germany,
Sweden, U.K. and U.S.A. all subscribe
to two educational principles. They
reject the so-called traditional tactics
of intimidation; their view is that from
an educational point of view, stressing
only the dangers of drugs serves no
useful purpose, because many teen¬
agers feel it is natural to take risks
and are rarely likely to feel themselves
directly affected by the dangers
described.
They also advocate the presentation
of facts, not of the value judgements
of an authoritarian educational system.
Teenagers are by nature often
rebellious, and clumsily imposed pro¬
hibitions can incite them to defiance.
Nevertheless, these countries fall
into two distinct groupings. There are

those who believe in the effectiveness
of drugs education and who have
produced programmes and started
distributing them on a nation-wide

The other group, including the U.K.,

'Only education enjoys the dubious

'AN education succeed
where so many other measures have
failed in preventing the spread of
adolescent drug abuse? This is the
first question we must ask ourselves
before assuming too readily that drugs
education in schools is the panacea
for which society has been searching.
The second problem is more serious.
Can we be sure that our intervention
will not do more harm than good?
Nobody knows the answers. There
has apparently never been a pre¬
dominantly teens and twenties epidemic
of drug abuse, and certainly not on
anything like the present scale. So
there is no social experience to guide
us. Nor do we have any convincing
evidence of a drugs educational
programme that has succeeded in
exerting a preventive influence.
Moreover, experience in related fields
suggests the need for caution. Sup¬
posedly preventive education about
sex in Great Britain and about alcohol
in Sweden, for example, seems to have
done as much to popularize these
"products" as to improve the balance
between use an abuse.
GEORGE BIRDWOOD, British doctor and
medical editor, is honorary chairman of the
London Region of the Association for the
Prevention of Addiction. In this capacity he
has given many talks to schoolchildren on
the question of drugs. His article is taken
from "Drugs and Society" (n° 4, Vol. I, 1972)
published monthly and © by Macmillan
journals Ltd., London.
Let us be clear from the start that
there could be more potential for
positive harm here than with the other
measures so far adopted.
Psychiatric or other medical treat¬
ment may not cure many addicts, but
it does not a few rogue doctors
apart create new ones. Much the
same is true of other types of expert
intervention, such as epidemiological
studies and pharmacological research.
They have little power to make matters
worse.
Only education enjoys that dubious
privilege. Yet it is currently enjoying
a great vogue in several countries.
Some of these programmes look to
me suspiciously like sets of instruc¬
tions. Whether they will have the
hoped-for preventive action or merely
serve as publicity for the drugs cult
is very much an open question. In
effect, teachers are the latest recruits
(or perhaps unwilling conscripts) to
the growing army of experts that
society is sending into the front line to
wrestle with the drugs problem on its
behalf.
Personally, I am doubtful if this is
a battle that the experts can win, and
I am certain that the front line is not
the place for them but more of that
later. First, we must take a look at
the case for drugs education, and then
at the ways in which it might best be
carried out. This is an essential

about systematic drugs education.
In the Fed. Rep. of Germany, owing
to the shortage of trained personnel
and because research is still going on,
no action has been prescribed at the
federal level, though some recommen¬
dations have been made. The number
of hours of drugs education, its place
in the programme and the choice of
methods are left to the local authorities
to decide. Meanwhile, the content of
this education is being examined, and
a number of guiding principles for
teachers can be singled out:
Emphasize the risks of the unknown
(the exact effect of a drug cannot
be foreseen).
Tell pupils not only about the
physiological effects of drugs, but
also about the way they interfere
with brain function in a way com¬
parable to the processes that occur
in the mentally sick.
Do not ostracize the sub-cultures.
Point out that only a small percent¬
age of young people take drugs.
Do not allow yourself to be shocked
or speak of drug-taking as being
unquestionably a form of depravity.
Point out that:
Anyone who takes drugs is evad¬
ing life; he is a daydreamer, incap¬
able of coming to grips with the
realities of life. He is not really
living, just being manipulated by
drugs.
Drugs do not broaden conscious¬
ness, but force it to function
abnormally (this is particularly
serious at a time of physical and
mental growth).
In the U.K., freedom of choice is left
to the schools and local education
authorities. In fact, action has only
been taken in areas where drugs pose
a specific problem. Many schools and
education authorities appear to have
reservations about systematic drugs
education since they are afraid of
stimulating students' interest and
encouraging experimentation.
They have even stronger reserv¬
ations concerning the drawbacks of
using methods such as highly emo¬
tional films and television programmes,
or lurid accounts of their experiences
by former drug-addicts.
In general, it is recommended that
precise details of drugs should not be
given (how they are taken, their
appearance, their effects); the teen¬
ager should be helped to use his own
judgement. Above all, care should be
taken not to exaggerate, as drug-
addicts do, the personal and social
importance of drugs and related prob¬
lems. It is better to show that drugs
are a very poor substitute for a real
commitment to life.

### 50904: The Mass media: a two-edged sword, are the mass media doing more harm than good in dramatizing the drug question?
The mass media
Are the mass media
doing more harm than good
in dramatizing the drug question?
LLL 14 countries studied
during Unesco's inquiry report that the
information media radio, television,
films and press have at various times
taken the initiative in publicizing the
drug problem.
None of the countries is radically
opposed to using the mass media
for campaigns against drug abuse,
whereas, in the case of education,
their attitudes were less clear-cut.
But many are critical of the manner
in which the mass media have hitherto
dealt with the subject. By dramatiz¬
ing and exaggerating the problem, they
say, coverage has often merely suc¬
ceeded in reinforcing stereotyped
public views on drug abuse.
Some countries, such as Costa Rica,
point out that the information media
have on occasions launched sensation¬
alist campaigns, completely unscien¬
tific in approach, which can hardly
be termed preventive. Switzerland
stresses the need for utmost caution
in the use of the mass media and in
the popularization of knowledge about
the drug problem.
Two countries, France and the
Federal Republic of Germany, go so
far as to hold the mass media (in
particular the popular press) partly
responsible for the sudden spread of
the drug problem, arguing that total
silence would have been preferable to
spreading sensational and often
inaccurate news.
Many nation-wide information cam¬
paigns have been organized by govern¬
ments, with the mass media operating
under their control, so as to counter¬
act the often negative effects of earlier
unofficial campaigns.
All countries, it seems, agree that
the mass media have played an import¬
ant role in the popularization of know¬
ledge about narcotics. But they are
divided on whether this action really
adds up to prevention of drug abuse.
They consider that concerted research
is needed to discover the real effect
of information given out by the mass
media and what dangers should be
avoided.
France, for example, points out that
nothing was done through the mass
media until August 1971, since no
problem had yet arisen, and it was
felt in these circumstances that infor¬
mation would have done more harm
than good. "By a series of haphazard
campaigns," says the French report,
"the press has made the public aware
of the problem without giving it the
real facts."
Differences of opinion arise over
methods of using the mass media.
Should newspaper and magazine edi¬
tors, and film, radio and television
producers be allowed complete free¬
dom of action? Should seminars be
organized to alert them to the need
for a more scientific approach to the
drug problem? Should a strategy be
drawn up at government level and
applied under government control?
Jamaica, Nigeria and Senegal gave
no direct answer to these questions,
but all other countries favour govern¬
ment action based, where possible, on
scientific research. They feel that an
information strategy should:
define clear objectives based on
a selected number of principles;
work out a general plan of campaign
and co-ordinate action by all
government departments involved;
draw up a precise information plan
for each branch of the media.
The French reply warns against the
harmful effects of "bad information",
or rather of a policy of haphazard
information. In the words of a French
Ministry of Public Health report, the
basic aim is "to convince everyone
directly or indirectly affected by the
problem of the dangers of drugs that

MASS MEDIA (Continued)
The need for a new strategy

all can play an active part in prevent¬
ing the spread of drug abuse."
The same report points to a number
of dangers to be avoided in achieving
this aim:
Information will be ineffective if it
fails to reach the public for which
it was intended. Appropriate channels
should be selected and information
tailored for each section of the public.
' If improperly presented, information
can stimulate rather than prevent drug
abuse. Detailed explanations of ways
and means of obtaining drugs, incom¬
plete descriptions of their harmful
effects, over-dramatization and inac¬
curacies, undue emphasis on the
pleasure to be derived from drugs,
can all have a negative effect.
The question of the pleasure given
by drugs needs to be approached with
special care. To deny it outright
obviously reduces credibility, especially
in the eyes of a young and often well-
informed public. To emphasize It, on
the other hand, invites experimentation.
"The best solution is to point out that
the use of drugs rapidly becomes a
need to relieve the anguish at their
absence rather than a search for
pleasure."
HE myth of the intellectual
stimulation claimed for drugs must
also be discredited. The social and
group aspects of certain drugs should
be played down and it should be point¬
ed out instead that real drug addicts,
heroin-takers for example, never form
lasting communities.
Information can harden society's
attitude towards drug-takers; it can
have traumatic effects on parents and
lead to the total rejection of the young
addict who will then have no further
hope of being cured.
Information can fail in its dissuasive
task if it establishes a false relation¬
ship between the problem of drugs and
other problems, lumping it together, for
example, with alcoholism; drugs are
a new phenomenon and social defence
mechanisms against them are still
weak. Or it can fail if it makes too
much of the relationship that has been
drawn between the spread of drug use
and the youth crisis and political pro¬
test. "The extension of the drug
problem is mainly due to the activities
of drug-pushers and of drug addicts
in need of funds. It is not a direct
consequence of the youth crisis,"
says the report.
In a booklet entitled "Principles of
an Information Strategy to Educate the
Public about Drug Abuse", the Fed.
Rep. of Germany notes: "It is now
almost impossible to open a news¬
paper or listen to the radio without
reading or hearing about the alarming
increase in the use of drugs among
young people in the Fed. Rep. of
Germany. In most cases these reports
contain no objective, factual infor¬
mation.
"Though supposedly Intended to
enlighten the reader, most articles in
the press actually increase drug con¬
sumption by rousing curiosity and by
minimizing the harmful aspects of
drugs, dramatizing them and adding a
touch of mystery to their use, thus
masking the real situation."
In most countries public information
on drugs has been handled in two
ways. At first information was given
in a random, uncontrolled fashion; but
faced with the ineffectiveness of this
type of approach and, indeed, the
harm it caused, governments reacted
by applying some general principles
and introducing overall plans for radio,
television and films. Trying to impose
a strict discipline on the national press
has often proved to be more difficult.
Six countries (Denmark, Iran (1),
Jamaica, Nigeria, United Kingdom,
United States) out of fourteen have
used special radio broadcasts for their
information campaigns. Two others
(Costa Rica, Fed. Rep. of Germany)
plan to incorporate facts about drug
abuse into general programmes.
In all countries information via the
radio is aimed chiefly at the general
1) Although Iran does not favour the Intro¬
duction of systematic drug education pro¬
grammes In schools, the Imperial Govern¬
ment has been carrying out a serious, far-
reaching campaign against narcotics over
the past two decades. Details of this action
were given to a meeting of experts held at
Unesco headquarters last January by Mr. F.
Saadat, Under-Secretary of State at the
Iranian Ministry of Information.
Mr. Saadat recalled that Iran Instituted a
total ban on the cultivation of the opium
poppy In 1955. In 1969, limited cultivation
was permitted for medical purposes only
under strict government control.
To gain public support for Its anti-drug
measures the government has formed the
Anti-Narcotics Society to deal exclusively
with the problem. The Society regularly pro¬
duces books and brochures on the subject,
broadcasts anti-drug radio and T.V. program¬
mes and, In close co-operation with the
national press, publishes articles and Infor¬
mation on the activities of the Society and
on help available through government hospi¬
tals and dispensaries.
public, though some items are intend¬
ed for the teenage audience, especially
in the United States where advantage
is taken of peak teenager listening
times. Apparently no use has been
made of the regular radio programmes
designed to appeal to young people.
Programmes generally present
panels of specialists answering ques¬
tions on drug addiction (as in Den¬
mark, U.K. and U.S.A.), general infor¬
mation on drugs (Nigeria), interviews
with drug addicts or ex-addicts (Den¬
mark, U.K.), news items about pen¬
alties imposed on drug-users and
drug-pushers (Jamaica), and dis¬
cussions on the question of legalizing
cannabis (U.K.).
wIDE use is made of tele¬
vision: seven of the fourteen countries
have put out programmes, and two
others (Costa Rica and the Federal
Republic of Germany) plan to produce
special broadcasts.
In the U.S.A. an original mass media
"combined operation" was carried out
in April 1970. Heads of radio, tele¬
vision and press in New Bedford,
Massachusetts got together to launch
a special campaign to raise funds to
extend the centre for the treatment of
drug addicts, a branch of the city's
largest mental health centre. Through¬
out April, newspaper advertisements,
news releases and radio and tele¬
vision spots publicized the campaign.
The climax was a combined radio and
television marathon.
The U.K. has been especially active
in the television field. From Decem¬
ber 1969 to November 1971, seven
full-length programmes were put out
by the BBC and by independent T.V.
networks.
Closer examination of the main
themes of these programmes reveals
that the information presented is
largely neutral in tone and is often
woven into a discussion or a detailed
analysis of scientific or social impli¬
cations of drug-taking.
The similarity between youthful drug
addiction and the habitual taking of
aspirin and other pills by adults is
also touched on. The problem is thus
treated in a comprehensive manner
and not confined to a certain section
of youth.
But in some cases the traditional
type of approach is still used. For
instance, the film, "Gail is dead",
## [Page 15](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/074885engo.pdf#page=15) 🆗

screened by the BBC, tells the story
of a teenager deprived of affection
who dies after taking an overdose of
drugs. The film is reported to have
made a considerable impression on
the public. Programmes produced by
the ORTF in France also aim to put
people on their guard.
Articles and news concerning drugs
appear in the national press in all
14 countries, but in most cases the
subject has not been dealt with ade¬
quately. Four countries (Costa Rica,
France, the Fed. Rep. of Germany,
India) are therefore studying how to
influence or control news on drug
abuse published in the national dailies.
In Costa Rica such action would be
taken through the Ministry of Health,
in India through the Office of Press
Information of the Ministry of Edu
cation, in the Fed. Rep. of Germany by
a special body responsible for health
education, and in France by the Inter¬
departmental Action Committee, an
organization set up to lead the fight
against drugs.
In many cases such organizations
supply news items, background mat¬
erial for articles, research findings on
drugs and special articles, such as
those distributed by the Central Fed¬
eral Office of Health Education of the
Fed. Rep. of Germany to 153 news¬
papers, dealing with subjects such as
the dangers of hashish or on escapism
as one motive for drug abuse.
The only country to report preventive
action through youth publications is
France which has distributed a booklet,
entitled "Fed up with Drugs", publish¬
ed by "Education and Social Life" in
collaboration with government organ¬
izations. The booklet Is illustrated
with drawings and cartoons, including
some by contributors to the "under¬
ground" press.
No evaluation of information cam¬
paigns on drug abuse has been made
in any of the countries covered
by Unesco's survey. But several
countries in which drugs have been a
major problem for some years, today
have some useful experience of the
effectiveness of different approaches.
In their view intimidation has proved
ineffective and it has become essential
to remove the "drama" attached to the
drug problem. Accurate and objective
information should be given, they say,
so that the public can freely take its
own decisions in full knowledge of the
facts.
Opening the 25th session of the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs on
January 22, 1973, Mr. Vittorio Winspeare Guiccardi, Director-General of the U.N. Office
at Geneva, referred to the global problem of the illicit drug trade. "The traditional
distinction between producing, manufacturing, transit and victim countries grows blurred...",
he said. "The traffic flows from all parts of the world to all other parts, from developing
countries to industrialized countries and vice versa." Below, coastguards inspect a coastal
vessel suspected of carrying drugs.

### 50906: The World drug situation: an up-to-date review by the United Nations Division of Narcotic Drugs
In support of the international effort against drugs,
the United Nations has just issued (13 April 1973)
a new series of three stamps showing a death's head
superimposed on an opium poppy head (above).
When the poppy head (left) is sliced with a knife, a
milky substance or latex oozes out from which are
made such killer drugs as opium, heroin, and morphine.
data and present well-balanced "world
statistics" in the form of a document,
is, unfortunately, not correct, due to
the simple fact that the annual reports
furnished by governments on drug
abuse do not contain very much
statistical data.
It would not be realistic to imagine
that the majority of governments do
not want to present statistics for the
use of international organs; on the
contrary, experience shows that
governments do furnish good statistics
about illicit traffic in narcotics and
most other aspects of the drug prob¬
lem. Drug abuse, however, is an
exception.
The explanation of this exceptional
situation is relatively simple: one
needs only take into account the
sources of information which are at
the disposal of national authorities.
There are, generally speaking, two
main sources of such information:
reports made and data collected by
(1) law enforcement services and (2)
health authorities.
What kind of statistical data can be
expected from law enforcement ser¬
vices? Data on quantities of drugs
seized at the frontiers or within the
country, and data on the number of
people involved in "narcotic offences"
such as possession of illegal drugs.
All these data are very useful indic¬
ations of the availability and possible
abuse of certain drugs, reflecting the
existence and the dimensions of the
drug problem in a country, but they
are of little value for the quantification
of the drug dependent population. It
is almost impossible to base statistical
data on drug abuse solely on law
enforcement statistics.
Statistics presented by health
authorities usually focus on drug
dependence; consequently, they might
seem to be more appropriate for the
development of a governmental statist¬
ical report on addiction, but, in this
case too, there are a number of draw¬
backs.
The quality of a report by national
health authorities largely depends
upon the general development and
level of the health service in the
respective country; in many develop¬
ing countries, where the number of
physicians is extremely low compared
with the size of the population, the
health service does not have the
necessary staff for case finding and
data collection.
Possibilities for the collection of
"hard data" on drug abuse by health
authorities are limited to countries
where health services are highly devel¬
oped, but even these countries face
many difficulties in data collection.
Let us consider the following
questions: is the reporting of drug
dependence cases compulsory or not?
Who is obliged to make such a report
and to whom? Are cases of occas¬
ional drug-taking or acute intoxication
included in the reporting system or
not? These are basic questions
influencing even the amount of statist¬
ical data collected by national health
authorities.
All of these difficulties are reflected

in the annual reports, and it is no
wonder that high quality statistics are
usually presented by health authorities

with narcotic analgesics (thereafter

The first group of people has nothing

problem; the second group shows only
the "tip of the iceberg". Conse¬

authorities do not give a clear and
complete view of the drug problem.
The Division of Narcotic Drugs
prepares documents on drug abuse
for the sessions of the Commission on
Narcotic Drugs. Statistics furnished
by governments are included in these
documents, but are not suitable for
comparison. The Commission and the
Division have undertaken the revision
of the reporting system and efforts
are made to assist governments in
improving the quality of their statistical
data, but it would be unrealistic to
think that uniformity of data collection
could be developed within the near
future. In developing countries with
a drug abuse problem, much more can
be learned from sample surveys than
from the finding of individual drug
abuse cases.
In view of this situation, any question
concerning the "total number of drug
abusers" must remain unanswered.
There are a number of other difficulties
in answering this question, and, while
pointing out the absence of a standard
interpretation of the term "abusers",
we would like to draw attention to the
inherent pitfalls of statistics or "total
numbers" which would include all
abusers of all drugs.
"Narcotic drug" (such as opiates,
cocaine, cannabis, coca leaf) and
"psychotropic substance" (such as
sleeping pills, stimulants, hallucino¬
gens) are legal terms and not pharma¬
cological definitions. Consequently,
in the field of drug abuse, on the one
hand, the distinction between the two
terms is not justified, and on the other,
a distinction should be made between
abusers of specific types of drugs.
(Both coca leaf and heroin are "nar¬
cotic drugs", but there are very few
similarities between a coca leaf chewer
and a heroin "mainliner"; persons
dependent on morphine a "narcotic
drug" or on secobarbital a "psycho¬
tropic substance" might show, on the
contrary, several common features.)
Consequently, this article gives a
general view of the world's drug abuse
situation based on the type of drug
used.
OPIUM AND OPIATES. There are a
number of countries where the use of
opium was traditional. Opium, as a
medicament or as a "pleasure giving
drug", was used by millions of people
without social stigma: it was a "social"
substance.
The world has changed, more and
more countries have become aware of
the dangers of opium abuse and
dependence, and the international
community has played a major role
in the prevention of the propagation of
opium abuse in countries where this
practice never existed and in the
reduction of the extent of opium use
in countries where opium was a tradi¬
tional drug.
India and the People's Republic of
China are the countries in Asia where
the changes have been the most
spectacular. Annual opium consump¬
tion has been reduced from 500 tons
Iran made a great effort to eradicate
opium abuse, but was not so success¬
ful; opium production has been resum¬
ed because the opium prohibition (in
1955) was followed by large scale
opium smuggling into the country.
Opium abuse continued, with catas¬
trophic economic and social con¬
sequences. Iran has introduced a
system of addict registration, and
80,000 opium addicts (who are over
60 years of age or who cannot be
given detoxication treatment because
of their condition) receive a ration of
legal opium established by medical
committees.
There are reports of opium abuse
in Asia from Burma, Hong Kong, Thai¬
land, the Republic of Viet-Nam, Laos,
Singapore and Pakistan. There are
relatively few cases of opium addiction
in Africa, in the Americas and in
Europe. The former "therapeutic

ATEST U.S. DRUGS STUDY CALLS FOR
A NEW APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM
In a report issued on March 22, 1973, in Washington D.C., the U.S.
National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse has called for a
far-reaching change of attitude on the whole problem of drugs. It termed
the present attitude "inconsistent and founded on many misconceptions".
Among more than 100 recommendations in its 481 -page report, the
Commission proposed:
A moratorium on all drug education programmes in schools until
existing programmes can be evaluated. The Commission found these
programmes "scientifically inaccurate and ineffective".
Severe punishment for drug traffickers.
No relaxation of existing legal controls over narcotics, with "the
highest possible restrictions" placed on heroin.
Legalization of possession of marijuana.
An end to advertizing of sedatives, tranquillizers, stimulants, and
other "mood-altering drugs" that promise to halt "malaise caused by
stress or anxiety".
The establishment of a Federal agency to take over all U.S. drug
programmes law enforcement, education, research and treatment.
The Commission called dependence on alcohol "without question the
most serious drug problem in the country today", adding "The most
serious concern in contemporary America should attach to the use of
alcohol and heroin." The Commission described the present widespread
use of barbiturates as "America's hidden drug problem".
I
at the beginning of this century to
about 5 tons at the present annual
consumption in India. The present
number of opium addicts is less than
100,000, and there are no more than
1,000 registered opium smokers in
the country.
In China, at the beginning of this
century, there were an estimated
10 million opium addicts; and in 1973,
in the Commission on Narcotic Drugs,
it was stated by the observer for the
People's Republic of China that opium
addiction had been eradicated in that
country.
addiction" to opium has disappeared
due to the fact that no more than
small quantities of opium are used for
medical purposes in these regions
(contrasting with some Asian countries
where opium is even now an important
medicament).
This situation does not mean that
these regions are absolutely free from
"symptoms" of opium addiction or that
there are no more "therapeutic
addicts", but the drug abuse scene
has followed the lines of industrial
development. Opium has been replac¬
ed in therapy by morphine, other

opium alcaloids and by derivatives or
synthetic alternates of these alcaloids.
"Therapeutic addicts" are, conse¬
quently, no longer dependent on
opium, but on morphine or pethidine
or methadone. A process similar to
this "legal" development has taken
pla'ce in the illicit market and among
drug abusers: in a number of countries,
opium abuse has been "replaced" by
the abuse of heroin.
There is, in fact, no legal heroin
production in the world. All of the
heroin consumed is made in clandes¬
tine laboratories from huge quantities
of illicit opium produced in areas
where governmental control is poor or
non-existent.
The number of heroin addicts has
increased, notably in North America
where in addition to the "traditional
milieu" (the slum areas) new layers
of the population are affected by this
form of addiction. The North Ameri¬
can scene is characterized by "main¬
lining", that is, intravenous injection of
heroin. The quantities injected are
very high because heroin is adulter¬
ated with quinine, procaine, lactose
and other substances; the "heroin" on
the New York black market does not
contain more than 3 to 5 per cent of
diacetylmorphine (heroin).
The number of heroin addicts in
Europe is relatively low (in the United
Kingdom, for example, the authorities
have reported about fifteen hundred
addicts who are regular users of
heroin), but in some Western European
countries the number of drug abusers
experimenting with heroin is on the
increase (in France, for example, the
number of heroin abusers has been
estimated to be about 15,000).
Heroin remains the main drug of
abuse in Hong Kong; contrary to North
American "mainlining", heroin is inhal¬
ed in the Far East. The same techni¬
ques of heroin abuse prevail in Thai¬
land (where heroin abuse has been
spreading since the introduction of the
UNITED NATIONS BODIES
IN THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUGS
Various bodies of the United Nations are engaged in the concerted
international anti-drug effort: (1) U.N. Commission on Narcotic Drugs (2)
U.N. Division of Narcotic Drugs (Geneva.) (3) U.N. Social Affairs Division
(4) U.N. Social Defense Research Institute (Rome) (5) U.N. Research Ins¬
titute for Social Development (Geneva) (6) U.N. Conference on Trade and
Development (7) U.N. Industrial Development Organization (8) U.N. Food
and Agriculture Organization (9) World Health Organization (10) Interna¬
tional Labour Organization and (11) Unesco. In April 1971 the U.N. Fund
for Drug Abuse Control was set up to co-ordinate and finance action by
U.N. and other organizations.
Many inter-governmental and non-governmental organizations are work¬
ing on the problem of drugs. Amongst these are: International Narcotics
Bureau, Interpol (International Criminal Police Organization), League of
Red Cross Societies, International Council on Alcoholism and Addiction,
and the Council of Europe.
opium prohibition), in some other
countries in Indochina and in Iran.
It is relatively easy to produce heroin
in a clandestine laboratory but the
production of morphine base is even
easier. The abuse of so-called "mor¬
phine base" is, consequently, spread¬
ing in some countries in Asia and in
Europe (notably in Northern Europe).
There is an increase in the abuse of
the so-called synthetic narcotics (syn¬
thetic alternates of morphine and other
opium alcaloids). There are a number
of "therapeutic addicts" who have
became dependent on these sub¬
stances, notably in Europe following
treatment with pethidine, methadone
or dextromoramide. The most sub¬
stantial increase in methadone depen¬
dence cases has been experienced in
countries where this drug is in use as
a substitute for heroin. The increase
in the number of methadone depen¬
dence cases is a "side effect" of
"methadone maintenance" in the United
States, Canada and a few other
countries.

more difficult than that of opium and
opiates. The view is hindered by:
a lack of statistics on the number
of consumers;
the fact that in some Asian
countries the use of cannabis is
still authorized or tolerated; and
the absence of a standard definition
of the "cannabis" consumed by
local users.
The general use of the term "canna¬
bis" without further defining the drug
(e.g. cannabis resin, cannabis as
defined in the Single Convention (1),
marijuana, etc.) contributes sub¬
stantially to the confusion, but some
trends and patterns in cannabis abuse
can be more or less detected.
The only figure available from areas
where the traditional use of cannabis
remains authorized is an estimate of
200,000 consumers in India. The
consumption of cannabis resin has
been prohibited in that country, but
cannabis itself (in the forms of ganja
and bangh) is still in use for medical,
quasi-medical and ceremonial pur¬
poses, as well as being a "social sub¬
stance".
Cannabis abuse remains a problem
in the Near and Middle East, where
huge quantities of cannabis resin
(hashish) are produced. A part of the
hashish produced is consumed locally
(increasingly by tourists, and first of
all the young ones) part is smuggled
into non-producing countries of the
region (for example into Egypt or
Turkey) and an ever increasing part
finds its way through the organized
illicit traffic to Western Europe.

WORLD DRUG SITUATION (Continued)
22
Abuse of cannabis (in the form of
ganja cigarettes) is spreading in the
Far East, but the increase in the
number of cannabis abusers seems to
be greatest in North America and in
Western Europe, where the "cannabis
question" has become an emotional
topic.
There is a substantial increase in
the use of cannabis resin in some
West European countries. The con¬
sumption of hashish is increasing in
the United States and Canada too, but
the principal form of cannabis abuse
is the smoking of "marijuana".
It is very difficult to find out what
"marijuana" means. In Latin Ameri¬
can countries, this term has been
applied to cannabis leaves. In the
light of the analysis of marijuana
samples seized in North America, it is
applied sometimes to something which
contains very potent cannabis prepa¬
rations, sometimes to "cannabis" (in
the sense of the Single Convention),
sometimes solely to leaves of canna¬
bis, and sometimes to something which
does not contain cannabis at all.
Without a basis for comparison, it is
impossible to determine or even
estimate how many hashish users and
cannabis users are among the several
million regular or occasional marijuana
users in North America and in some
West-European countries.
There are a substantial number of
"dagga" consumers in South Africa,
Cannabis abuse is spreading in other
countries too, notably in West and
East Africa.
There are reports of the abuse of
"cannabis oil" or "hashish oil". This
preparation contains a large amount of
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), one of the
active principles of cannabis; conse¬
quently, its use is even more danger¬
ous than that of hashish.
COCA LEAF. Coca leaf chewing
remains a social problem in the
Andean countries of South America
where huge quantities of coca leaves
are consumed by the indigenous
population. According to the Argen¬
tine government's report, the number
of coca-leaf chewers in that country
is estimated at 50,000. This figure
does not reflect the size of the problem
in the whole region, where the number
of addicts is of the order of several
million.
COCAINE. In the light of seizure
reports, the production and consump¬
tion of cocaine 'is on the increase.
Little data is available on cocaine
abusers because the majority of
cocaine abusers are multiple drug
abusers. There are many cocaine
abusers among heroin addicts.
PSYCHOTROPIC SUBSTANCES.
There are very few official reports on
psychotropic substances at the dis¬
posal of the Division of Narcotic
Drugs. The Convention on Psycho¬
tropic Substances of 1971 is quite
recent and has not yet entered into
force. Until now, very few govern¬
ments have collected data on the
abuse of these substances.
There are contradictory reports on
the use of hallucinogens. A decrease
in the abuse of LSD was recently
noted by North American experts, but
in some West European countries the
number of LSD abusers was on the
increase. LSD remains the most
widely abused hallucinogen, and cases
of its abuse have been reported from
other regions of the world (Africa, Asia
and the Far East).
Abuse of stimulants of the central
nervous system is still spreading.
Amphetamine, dexamphetamine, meth-
amphetamine and phenmetrazine are
the most frequently abused stimulants.
"Mainlining" (intravenous injection) of
excessive doses of stimulants remains
a problem in some West European and
North American countries.
There are indications that substantial
quantities of various amphetamine
tablets have been smuggled into Afri¬
can countries; the control of impor¬
tation and distribution of these drugs
is relatively lax in many African
countries, and several governments in
the region are worried about the
growth of amphetamine abuse.
There is only limited data on the
abuse of hypnotics, sedatives and
tranquillizers, but many indications of
an increase in their abuse. No region
is free from the abuse of these sub¬
stances, but people abusing hypnotics,
sedatives or tranquillizers are usually
multiple drug abusers. Data collect¬
ion concerning their abuse is there¬
fore very difficult.
MULTIPLE DRUG ABUSE. It was
noted by the Commission on Narcotic
Drugs at its last session in January-
February 1973, that the trend towards
multiple drug abuse among drug
abusers seemed to be a common
feature of the drug scene in various
parts of the world. This trend was
due* partly to the availability on the
black market of different types of
drugs, and partly to changes in the
"taste" of drug-takers experimenting
with a great variety of legal and illegal
drugs.
There are some well-known drug-
combinations such as heroin-cocaine,
barbiturates-amphetamines, heroin-bar¬
biturates, but the number of people
consuming five or ten different drugs
at the same time or alternatively is
increasing every day.

Although the harmfulness of drugs
is generally recognized, this has
been challenged in some coun¬

of drugs such as cannabis. Unesco

on this question as part of the
international study it carried out
on drugs (see page 6). In the

Cannabis, or Indian hemp, is grown in all parts of the world's temperate and
tropical regions and is also found, as a wild plant, is some parts of India and
Latin America (above). It is from cannabis that substances know variously as
hashish, marijuana, kif, ganja, bhang, charras and maconha are obtained.
IIN the United States, an
opinion fairly widely held among young
people is that marijuana is no more
harmful than alcohol and that its use
should therefore be legalized and
brought under regulation in the same
way as the use of various alcoholic
drinks. The prevailing view, however,
is that it would be wiser to await the
results of current research before
treating marijuana in the same way as
alcohol, and that in consequence the
use of marijuana should continue to
be prohibited.

### 50907: A UNESCO inquiry on the harmfulness of cannabis
CANNABIS (Continued)
Is marijuana
a first step to stronger drugs?
24
It is only since 1968 that detailed
scientific studies have been made in
that country on the effects produced
by the products of cannabis. The
findings of this research to date have
enabled the authorities to state, in a
joint information publication intended
for the public at large, that while
marijuana and hashish may not cause
physical dependence, the long-term
use of these substances brings about
a psychological dependence.
According to this publication, the
excessive use of cannabis can have
harmful effects, particularly from the
psychological and social standpoints,
since it puts an artificial gloss over
reality and thus causes excessive
users, particularly young 'people, to
avoid facing up to life's real problems
and to fail to develop their physical
and mental abilities. Lately, some
research workers have thought they
were able to establish a connexion
between the abuse of cannabis and a
certain type of social maladjustment.
It should be borne in mind that the
view in the United States is that the
effects of the chronic use of cannabis
are not yet scientifically known.
Medical literature contains an abund¬
ance of reports on the acute psychoses
occasioned by the prolonged use of
Indian hemp (cannabis) but it is
thought that this problem still calls for
scientific research on a wider scale.
As for the "escalation" which the
use of the products of cannabis is said
to entail, in other words the pro¬
gression to the use of stronger and
stronger drugs, the opinion is that ma¬
rijuana does not by itself create the
need to use other drugs, but surveys
carried out by the U.S. National Ins¬
titute of Mental Health show that
excessive users of marijuana tend to
experiment with other substances:
most often hashish, and then strong
hallucinogens, amphetamines, and,
occasionally, barbiturates. A small
number also progress to opium or
heroin.
A survey carried out in a college
showed that among the heavy
marijuana smokers, one per cent
became heroin addicts. Other surveys,
however, carried out In California
among persons arrested for using
marijuana, revealed a much higher
proportion of heroin addicts, ranging
from 13 to 22 per cent.
Moreover, surveys conducted among
heroin addicts have shown that about
85 per cent of the persons questioned
tried marijuana to begin with. In
addition, certain lawyers are of the
opinion that the criminality rate is
higher among excessive users of
marijuana.
For the purpose of advancing the
study of problems relating to the use
of the products of cannabis and of
arriving at scientifically valid con¬
clusions, the Comprehensive Drug
Abuse Prevention and Control Act of
1970 provided for the establishment of
a Commission on the abuse of
cannabis and narcotic drugs, which
was to examine the extent and effects
of the use of these substances and to
evaluate the efficacy of the laws In
force in this matter.
After a year's work involving
scientists and experts in all the
branches of learning that might be
concerned by these problems, the
Commission last year submitted its
first report to the President and the
Congress of the United States.
HE Commission bases its
findings on the results of a national
survey carried out under its auspices,
and it considers that the use of mari¬
juana is at present spreading in all
sectors of the population of the United
States. This survey estimates that
about 24 million Americans over eleven
years of age, that is to say, 15 per cent
of the adult population over 18 years
of age and 14 per cent of the adoles¬
cents between 12 and 17, have tried
marijuana at least once.
The survey points out that among
those who have used marijuana, 41 per
cent of the adults and 45 per cent of
the adolescents have given up its use,
but there are nevertheless now half a
million persons who have become
excessive users, taking this drug
several times a day.
The Commission is of the opinion

A series of experiments on the behaviour of
baboons under the effects of cannabis and
other psychotropic substances was recently
carried out atthe University of Dakar, Senegal,
by Professor H. Giono. A baboon injected
with cannabis rapidly experienced diffi¬
culties of balance and was unable to move
along or hang from the horizontal bar of a
climbing frame (far left). Cannabis also affec¬
ted the animal's social behaviour: social
contact was reduced, sexual relationships
diminished and grooming activity and play
restricted. A test with peanuts provided
further evidence of the effects of cannabis.
Two animals sharing a cage were made to
compete for food. After absorbing a dose of
cannabis the stronger of the two, who nor¬
mally seized the food, was reduced to a
pitiful state of weakness (see graph, left).
With a regular dosage of cannabis, the animal
became aggressive and bad-tempered.
that any psychoactive substance is
potentially harmful to the individual,
according to the intensity, frequency
and duration of its use, and that mari¬
juana is no exception.
In examining in this way the effects
of the products of cannabis on the
individual, the Commission has come
to the conclusion that although the
risks of harm, in so far as it has been
possible to prove them, resulting from
the experimental or occasional use of
these products are slight and do not
produce demonstrable organic lesions,
the danger lies in the excessive
and prolonged use of these products
and in particular of their strong pre¬
parations.
Some of the moderate users show
signs of a certain psychological
dependency, the intensity of which
increases with the drug's continued
use. Prolonged use increases the
likelihood of the occurrence of effects
on behaviour and on the organism
such, for instance, as progression to
excessive use.
Excessive users show a strong
psychological dependence on mari¬
juana and often on hashish. These
users are susceptible to organic
lesions and may show signs of
specific changes in behaviour. These
effects are more apparent, however,
when use is over lengthy or very
lengthy periods.
Finally, persons who make unlimited
usage of cannabis and who live in
countries where the use of this drug,
usually in the form of hashish, is an
indigenous and traditional custom,
have in consequence a psychological
dependence. As the use oí the drug
continues, the changes in behaviour
appear very clearly and the cases of
biological lesions become more fre¬
quent. This type of use is not,
however, observed in the United
States.
The Commission is of the opinion
that, in the present state of knowledge
concerning the effects of the products
of cannabis, their use does not
constitute a major threat to public
health. This should not lead to
complacency, since it is none the less
true that these substances are harmful.
wITH regard to the changes
in behaviour which might be induced
by use of the products of cannabis,
the Commission is very critical of the
widely accepted stereotype according
to which the users of this drug are
aggressive, lacking in self-control,
irresponsible, mentally sick, inclined to
crime and, in consequence, a danger
to public safety.
The Commission points out that,
although there may be a statistical
correlation between the use of the
products of cannabis, examined in-
^ÑSscc
dependently of the other variables, and
the frequency of criminal or other
offences, there is no convincing proof
that the use of these products inevit¬
ably leads or incites to crime and
violence.
The American Commission rejects
the idea of regulating or legalizing the
use of marijuana the long-term effects
of which are not yet certain, but is
unanimous in thinking that persons
who smoke or possess marijuana
should not be liable to prosecution (1).
In Sweden, the official position, and
particularly that of the police, is to
consider the abuse of hashish and
marijuana as an introduction to the
excessive consumption of major nar¬
cotic drugs such as opium and LSD 25.
Nevertheless there are varying points
of view with regard to the social
significance of the use of the former
drugs and the effects they may have
on an individual's behaviour.
The police consider that there is a
close connexion between the abuse of
narcotic drugs in general and delin¬
quency, since drug addicts often
engage in drug trafficking or commit
other offences so as to get the money
they need to buy their drugs. In
support of their argument, the police
also point to the fact that the pro¬
portion of drug users is higher among

those people who have been sentenc¬
ed by the courts.
In Denmark, it is stated that the
ideological propaganda for, and the
philosophical justification or cult of,
cannabis have now practically dis¬
appeared.
In Jamaica, according to the reply of
the National Commission for Unesco,
there are contradictory opinions
because scientific knowledge concern¬
ing the effects of ganja [a form of
cannabis] is still approximate and the
conclusions reached are divergent.
The effects attributed to the use of
ganja can be neither categorically
denied nor categorically confirmed.
In the Federal Republic of Germany,
the harmfulness of hashish and mari¬
juana has been called in question by
several publications, and certain circles
are suggesting that the use of these
drugs should be legalized.
Despite the differences of opinion
that are apparent concerning the
physical effects of the products of
cannabis, research in social psychiatry,
psychology and education, as well as
actual experience in medical and so¬
cial institutions for drug addicts, gen¬
erally reach the conclusion that the
habitual use of these substances occa¬
sions a psychological dependence,
conduces to the impairment of the de¬
velopment of the personality and has
harmful effects from the social point
of view, particularly in the case of
unstable individuals.
In many instances, the use of drugs
results in a falling off in performance
at school and at work, which may lead
to the abandonment of studies or of
employment.
Further, information obtained on the
use of the products of cannabis shows
that a large number of hashish or
marijuana smokers try and then adopt
stronger drugs such as heroin,
LSD 25, etc. It should, however, be
mentioned that according to some
research, the phenomenon of "ecala-
tion" occurs mostly among excessive
users.
According to the survey carried out
in Cologne in 1970, for example, most
of the addicts and traffickers inter¬
viewed stated that heavy hashish
smokers are the most likely to use
other stronger drugs or to become
multiple drug addicts.
Some medical research has also
provided indications that the products
of cannabis are harmful even from the
physical and hereditary standpoints.
The Federal Government, taking its
stand on the results of all this
research, is entirely opposed to any
claim that hashish and marijuana are
harmless, and considers that the use
of these drugs should remain pro¬
hibited until their harmlessness is
scientifically established.
SPIDERS' WEBS AND LSD. The spider's web is a prolongation of the animal's own central nervous
system. Researchers can thus measure changes in the spider's behaviour when it is given doses of
a psychotropic substance. A research team led by Dr. Georges Groh carried out experiments at a
hospital in Quebec (Canada) in which they gave doses of LSD 25 to a species of marsh spider, the
"Argyropes". Photos below show how web-spinning deteriorates under the influence of the
drug. Left, after a single weak dose of LSD, the web already begins to show imperfections. Centre,
after minor doses administered for ten days, the pattern of the web shows serious irregularities.
Right, after five weeks of LSD the web is unrecognizable, reduced to a few suspension lines and
a jumble of threads at the centre. It has ceased to be an efficient food trap for the spider.

Are we doomed to despair, to the

MARCEL HICTER Is Director-General for Youth and Leisure at the Belgian
Ministry of Culture and is on the Faculty of the Université Libre, Brussels. 'He
was Belgian delegate to the International Conference on Youth organized by
Unesco at Grenoble, France, in 1964 (See his article "The Angry Generation",
"Unesco Courier", April 1969). Prof. Hicter is the author of a major study, prepared
for a symposium on drug dependence organized by the Council of Europe at
Strasbourg last year, of which the article published here Is a condensed, edited

{RE we doomed to despair,
to the meaninglessness of human
existence, to the absurd and the gro¬
tesque portrayed by Camus, Ionesco
and Beckett? How can man live in a
scientific age when he is no longer
master of the situation? Technology
is no longer guided by man, it is
impelled forward by its own needs.
I have re-read the futurologists of
both East and West. The "future
shock", the psychosomatic disease of
the entire human organism, is spread¬
ing because of man's inability to
adapt himself rapidly enough to the
lightning progress of technology.
Restricted by its human dimensions,
our conceptual capacity is now insuf¬
ficient. The more man grasps of
nature, the less he can understand
his own nature. To quote the Hun¬
garian-born British scientist Dennis
Gabor, in his book "Inventing the
Future": "Till now man has been up
against nature; from now on he will
be up against his own nature."
Man will become integrated into __
complex operational systems which / /
are multi-functional and multidiscipli-

new humanism. Social stratification
will take on new dimensions. The
gap between rich and poor will dim¬
inish increasingly, only to be recrea¬
ted between the educated and the
uneducated.
Contrary to what is happening
today, when millions of workers ensure
the well-being of a privileged minority,
a minority of the intellectually elite will
be constantly pushed to the limits of
physical and mental effort to provide
luxurious leisure for a majority with
thousands of millions of docile tech¬
nological slaves at its beck and call.
All these problems are likely to be
particularly acute in the case of the
young, say the futurologists Herman
Kahn and Anthony J. Wiener, in their
book "The Year 2000".
Similarly, those among the young
who have no say in the social system,
will feel increasingly alienated by a
society which openly disregards what
youth consider as minimum standards
of social justice (requirements which
appear Utopian and unattainable to
the decision-makers). Ideological
movements will thus be born, aimed
at providing reasoned and moral jus¬
tifications for rebellion and for a clean
break with outmoded values by young
people of all social classes.
Young people who are intellectually
less-endowed, but who also rebel will
tend to sink into delinquency and
crime. Other symptoms of social
malaise (mental diseases and neuro¬
sis; divorces and suicides, for
example) are also likely to increase.
The traditional religions may well
continue to lose ground or will be re¬
interpreted, revised and secularised
so as to offer less of an obstacle to
generally accepted behaviour.
In political terms, such pessimistic
perspectives will lead many persons
to cling to the past, to denounce moral
decay, to reaffirm traditional values
and, as a last resort, to demand strict
enforcement of order, thus creating
an increasing threat to democracy.
Many persons react in this way to
the problem of drugs.
That is why I feel it is imperative to
spotlight the causes of our great fear
of the future and to replace them with
the hope of a happy society based on
a wider participation at all levels.
Man no longer lives in nature as
such, he lives in a nature he has
imposed upon himself. He is no
longer a simple, natural being; he is
now shaped by his own handiwork.
He will soon be living in a world, in
an increasingly artificial environment
where even his gestures will be
artificial.
In this context, the French socio¬
logist Jean Fourastié asks: "How can
human thought, moulded during thou¬
sands of years by the slow and regular
rhythm of the climate, the seasons,
sun and rain, wind and frost, be
expected to respond to the sudden
intrusion of the rapid, staccato, per¬
petually repeated rhythms imposed by
the demands and the use of machines?
"What will be the implications for
man's moral and intellectual equili¬
brium of the new ways of thinking
conditioned by today's technological
environment, by the horizon which has
dwindled from Virgil's fields to a
place on the assembly line, by the
sapping of initiative through growing
specialization, by the rigid timing
imposed by mechanization, and by the
passive submission of the mind to the
laws of the machine, whether in their
discovery, their observance or their
application?"
Have we ever found out what young

people think when we talk to them
about lifelong education, and tell them:
You are being awarded university
degrees for knowledge that is out of
date so your degrees, too, are obsol¬
ete. You will never really "graduate"
from university. If you stop study¬
ing, you may become a "has-been"
at the age of 30.
At forty you will earn your living in
occupations that do not even exist
today. You will have to change your
job several times and your place of
work even more often. And you will
witness several revolutions in indus¬
trial production during your working
life.
You will never be able to relax your
effort to re-adapt and retrain for new
jobs, no matter how difficult and exact¬
ing you find it. And you will spend
most of your "leisure" time doing just
that. Anyone who stays put, who
passively follows a routine at work
will be eliminated.
More than any previous generation,
young people today therefore need an
education that develops solid charac¬
ter and sound reasoning. Yet what
Is happening in reality?
recent inquiry undertaken
by the Académie de Toulouse, in
France, shows that young people
spend 200 hours more in front of the
TV screen than they do listening to
their teachers. And as we know, from
the mass of information he gulps down
indiscriminately, the reader or viewer
retains only what has been dramatized.
Moreover the mass media stifle
information by the very mass of
information they pour out. They can
produce an "industrial conditioning"
of the mind. They result in super¬
ficial knowledge that leads to woolly
ideas about doctrinal systems and
thus to the discrediting of authority
(family, school, political party, trade
union or church).
The media artificially nurture sub¬
cultures "ghettoes" in which the
young are isolated and they strength¬
en the hold of certain industries on
the "youth market," thus promoting
the commercial exploitation of the
young.
When it comes to the problem of
drugs, rather than explain its real roots
which might call an existing system
in question, the press either focuses
on irrelevancies or partial solutions or
highlights only one aspect, leaving the
real problem in the dark, at
the risk of inventing spurious prob¬
lems that mislead both young people
and adults.
The mass media carry advertizing
for alcohol, tobacco and medicines,
in other words for legalized drugs.
The press therefore refers only to
certain drugs in disparaging terms.
"Drugs", as seen by the press are
limited to those banned by law, with
the exception of a few pharmaceutical
products which it puts in the same
bracket.
' Since such drugs are illegal, they
must be combatted with the power
and the arms of the law; police and
court action is then reported in sen¬
sational terms.
Once the forces of law and order
come into the picture the situation
escalates. Things have "gone too
far". The drugs problem becomes
an obsession among adults, parents
in particular, whilst the young grow
more and more angry and embittered.
This drug psychosis and the atmo¬
sphere of fear and tragedy are
aggravated by blaring headlines.
As drugs which are legal and also
profitable for society are deliberately
sidestepped, the young are thus, if
not the most numerous and serious
addicts, at least the ones on whom
the glare of publicity is turned. This
"youth-drugs" association is used and
abused by the press.
The articles published in the press
(on youth and drugs), their titles
(youth and drugs) and the photographs
that illustrate them (youth and drugs)
create a current of public opinion
which influences both parents and
children.
The press thus presents a one¬
sided picture by restricting the meaning
of the word "drugs" and by relating
it solely to youth, whereas it is adults
who are most affected by drug
addiction. Supporting a system which
itself endangers a large part of the
population, the press camouflages the
commercial reasons, which are the
real causes for the phenomenon, by
advancing secondary causes as basic
ones: "To escape from family prob¬
lems"; "Lack of vocational training";
"The urge to 'opt out" of society";
"The generation gap"; "Drug-takers.
want to be addicts".
Sometimes the press publishes
totally false information: "Most heroin
addicts are aged between fifteen and
twenty-one", it tells us.
It quotes non-existent "statistics"
which nevertheless impress the
reader: "Out of 93 people sentenced
for peddling or taking drugs, 48 were
under the age of 25". As the young
are constantly under police sur¬
veillance, and are more vulnerable
than adults when they are up against
the law, it follows that they are the
more frequently arrested and sen¬
tenced.
In other words, by publishing
incomplete, edited and often untrue
information, the press creates an
unmistakable trend of opinion. In
this way, it evades the deep-rooted,
material causes of the problem and
thus does nothing to eliminate it.
Since all these reasons are econo¬
mic, the press, in fact, is looking after
its own interests, under a system on
which it depends and which it defends.
HlOW can the press incite
or discourage drug-taking by young
people?
By treating "youth" as a social
group it isolates and differentiates
young people from others, thus gener¬
ating antagonism between this group
and others ("zenophobia" between
social groups is an established fact
in western society). In isolating the
group it isolates each member of the
group from other social groups. It
makes each young person feel a need
to identify with and join others of his
own age.
By directly associating the words
"youth" and "drugs" the press incites
young people to take drugs since they
feel that only in this way will they be
accepted by the social group into
which the mass media have put them.
A young person who reacts actively
against the society in which he lives
(unlike an adult who reacts passively),
needs to find a social identity. By the
trend of opinion that it has created,
the press forces on him not only the
"youth" concept but the combined
concept of "youth-drugs".
Moreover, by evading the basic
issues of drug abuse it perpetuates in
young people the feelings of anxiety,
insecurity and incoherence created by
the social system in which they live.
It also perpetuates the desire for
escape, oblivion and evasion which
finds expression in drug-taking.
The kind of press I have described
conditions people deliberately to turn
a blind eye to certain problems, and
prevents real answers and remedies
from being found. Instead, the prob¬
lems are aggravated and multiplied to
the point where escape to the world
of drugs becomes the only immediate
evasion for adults and for the young.
Let me give an example quoted by
Dr. André Boudreau, Director-Gen¬
eral of the Office for the Prevention
of Alcoholism and Other Addic¬
tions, in Canada. "In Quebec," he
said, "over a third of young people
questioned during an inquiry into the
drug problem said that they had first OQ
tried drugs as a result of television fcO
programmes in which 'stars' had talked
about drug-taking . . . ". Advertizing,

DRUGS AND SOCIETY (Continued)
A way of life and not just a standard of living
30
the star-cult and news a combination
which leads nowhere, if not to drugs.
Where young victims of drugs are
concerned I consider police repression
and psychiatric treatment an ad¬
mission of failure and an acceptance
of a tragic situation. The fear of
syphilis rarely stopped our grand¬
fathers from indulging in amatory
adventures, nor has the fear of hell
stopped people having sins to confess.
A different approach is therefore
needed.
Let us be clear about one thing.
There is no "youth problem"; there
are only youth aspects of society's
global problems. The young recog¬
nize no statutory restraint that compels
them to put up with our inhuman
society, unlike their elders who are
obliged by social position or pro¬
fession to follow well-trodden paths
signposted by respectability or other
obligations.
I sometimes wonder whether the
blind rage felt by some adults towards
the young is not mere resentment
because, for reasons of social status,
they themselves dare not indulge in
certain freedoms (sexual freedoms,
for example) which are common
practice among the young.
You may tell me that there is a
silent majority among youth among
adults, too. The silent majority is
resigned to its fate that of being
preyed upon.
But there is a minority that accuses,
dissents and rejects. It has no need
of drugs because its life is full and
boredom is unknown; its stimulant is
hope and it sets new values or infuses
fresh life into old ones.
There Is another, larger minority that
works in the youth sections of the
important philosophical, religious and
political movements. They do not
take drugs either because their partici¬
pation in campaigns for reform and
education occupies their lives and
inspires their will to succeed.
The same is true of those sports¬
men who have not "gone profes¬
sional," who have kept clear of the
commercial side of sport.
Finally there is the minority that
"opts out"; the minority that concerns
us here.
I can already draw one global con¬
clusion, namely that a problem created
by a state of crisis in society can be
solved only by a new policy, affecting
the whole of that society, its organiz¬
ation, its aims and its system of
values.
In a society aimed at promoting
man's development and not merely the
management of production and con¬
sumption, a society that deserves
affection and offers security, there
will be no agonizing drug problem
because there will be no urge or
reason to escape from society.
In other words, the problem I am
posing concerns the quality of life,
and I say that the destiny of man
is to be more not to have more;
to have a way of life, not just a
standard of living, even if this means
struggling against the current of
impersonal forces and endeavouring
to change, by human willpower and
determination, what some would have
me believe is the course of history.
We should begin by changing
education so that as early as possible
a young person becomes an indepen¬
dent, mentally mature adult, respon¬
sible for himself and for the various
communities in whose life he shares:
his family, his district, his town or
country, and finally the world. Trained
to be both independent and respon¬
sible, he will not be caught off-balance
by the suggestions of a friend or drug-
pedlar, and the idea of having to do
the same as others will not even cross
his mind.
From his earliest days, a child must
become accustomed to choosing, in
the cultural and every other field, from
the vast and Indiscriminate flood of
things with which we are being
swamped.
From the start we must stimulate a
child's ability not only to assimilate
knowledge, but also to reason clearly
and selectively, to establish priorities
and values, so that the deluge of
information and suggestion can be
digested and controlled.
From early childhood, attitudes
(and aptitudes) that make for cre-
ativeness must be developed so that
each individual can find in self-
expression constant sources of happi¬
ness and satisfaction, and thus escape
the boredom of commercialized
leisure.
All this should lead to a new and
active form of culture that gives a
more personal dimension to life.
And this gives a new dimension
and urgency to the working out of a
leisure policy, systematically organized,
properly financed and offering the
right Incentives. It would cost far
less to do this than to enlarge our
prisons and psychiatric hospitals.
It would also be more effective in the
sense that an ounce of prevention is
worth a ton of cure.

THE DON'TS

OF DRUG EDUCATION
preliminary. On no account should
we uncritically accept the notion that
all drugs education is good, and push
our teachers into an ill-considered
campaign that might well turn out to
be an abuse of education itself. On
the other hand, we must not continue
to miss the opportunity to put educa¬
tion to use.
We have already seen that the case
for drugs education cannot be based
on statistical evidence of its value or
effects. If we wait for such evidence
before taking action always a plaus¬
ible rationalization for official inertia
we may wait indefinitely and in vain.
The constantly changing pattern of
drug abuse and the difficulty of
collecting reliable data may prove to
be insuperable obstacles. So the case
must be made out on other grounds.
The most obvious is the general pro¬
position that well-informed teenagers
would be better equipped to take
rational decisions about drugs.
This sounds reasonable enough to
anxious parents. The snag is that it
is not anxious parents we have to
convince but their teenage children
whose behaviour may be governed
more by fashion, instinct and emotion
than by reason. Somehow we have
to appeal to their hearts as well as
to their heads.
But this may be no simple matter:
what looks like a problem to us looks
much less like one to many teenagers.
Like the promiscuous teenage girl
who denied any sex problems "I just
do what I like, so where's the
problem?" they cannot see what all
the fuss is about. Drug-taking, they
claim, is a private affair which does
not harm others and should not
concern society.
Somehow we have to convince the
minority of potential drug-takers and
their sympathisers that there is a good
case for intervening to prevent (or
treat) what many of them see as a
private, self-regarding action. Unless
we are clear about this in our own
minds, we shall never convince a
generation of teenagers successfully
taught to think for themselves. After
all, it is questionable whether we, with
our cigarettes and alcohol, our tran¬
quillizers and sleeping tablets, are in
a position to point the finger at "them"
at all.
The basic contention that habit-
forming drugs are too dangerous even
for adults to make up their own minds
about is reinforced by the fact that
even in Britain's new Misuse of Drugs
Act, for instance, there is no special
protection for minors. Yet the young
are specifically at risk. We fail them
criminally if we provide neither the
protection to which they are entitled,
nor the necessary guidance on which
to base a decision that drugs are not
worthwhile.
So the case for education can be
based, first, on long-established
principles with which few teenagers
would argue though there might well
be some disagreement about the age
at which they should be allowed to
start taking their own decisions. It
can also be based on certain features
of adolescent drug-taking itself: its
tendency to spread not unlike an
infection among susceptible teenagers,
chronically infecting some, injuring
others physically or mentally.
The point I would make is
simply that teenagers even pro-drugs
teenagers are hardly less concerned
about them than their anxious parents.
Indeed, those teenagers least concern¬
ed about drug-taking as such may be
among the most concerned about its
ill-effects, for they are more likely to
have seen them.
In other words, it is the people that
matter to them, not the drugs; perhaps
this is as it should be. And in a wider
field these same teenagers are often
among the most deeply concerned
about the sort of society in which
youthful and adult drug-taking has
become so widespread. It is here
that the adult world should be able to
reach the heart. as well as the head
of teenage opinion.
For all these reasons I try when
talking to adolescents about drugs to
enlist their interest in drug-taking as
a serious social problem, and discuss
with them why they think it has come
about and what should be done about it.
In my experience, the best technique
in schools is to divide a class of
anything between twenty and fifty into
three or four discussion groups, each
with a leader and a reporter (who
records their main conclusions only).
Each group discusses a specific topic,
such as: Why a specifically teenage
drugs epidemic and why now? Why
are so many adults dependent
on cigarettes, alcohol, tranquillizers,
sleeping tablets, stimulants, even
gambling and TV? What should we
be doing about it?

### 50902: The Don'ts of drug education: 'only education enjoys the dubious privilege of having the power to make matters worse...'
DON'TS OF DRUG EDUCATION (Continued)
Eight pitfalls to be avoided
32
Such groups, especially those dis¬
cussing parental weaknesses, need
little encouragement to discuss actively
for half an hour or more. Few are
bored, as happens so easily when a
lecture on drugs is given to a large
class, which is usually divided into
those who think they know it all
already and those who aren't interested
anyway. After the separate discussion
groups, the whole class comes
together for general discussion, which
must be handled by a well-informed
person, preferably a teacher at the
school in question.
HIS method seems to me
to have several advantages.
First, it can be an interesting, lively
and relevant experience for both
teacher and taught; both have much
to learn from each other, and the
"unmentionable" subject of drugs
suddenly becomes freely discussed.
Second, discussion is automatically
pitched at the right age and intelligence
levels for the pupils, who may be
anything from ten to eighteen, of high
or low intelligence.
Third, the young are pushed into
making up their own minds about
drugs, something that many of them
will sooner or later have to do for
themselves. After all, it Is they, not
us, who are likely to be offered
marijuana, and it is they who will have
to learn to live with the stronger drugs
of the future.
Fourth, there is little difficulty in
reaching broad agreement on the
serious aspects of drug abuse over¬
dosage, inability to work, physical and
mental disorders, accidents, involve¬
ment with crime, the dangers of
addiction, driving under the influence,
corrupting children with drugs and
so on.
The class can then draw a line
between use and abuse medical or
social, differing from country to country
and I find that my line is in almost
the same position as that of the great
majority of teenagers. Even if we
disagree about pot, this tends to fade
into insignificance if we agree about
almost everything else.
In these ways one can avoid the
two great dangers of drugs education:
the giving of sets of instructions in a
way that positively invites experi¬
mentation; and the creation of a
generation gap between a repre¬
sentative of the "anti-drugs" adult
world and "pro-drugs" teenagers.
For the latter purpose it is essential
that we educate parents and teachers
in the same way. In my experience,
the majority of teenagers are by no
means uncritically pro-drugs, unless
we make the mistake of pushing them
into that defiant posture. It is an
easy mistake to make. But it is
equally easy, on the lines I have tried
to outline, to reach their idealism and
their concern for others.
At worst, I believe that this approach
can do no harm, but there are a
number of pitfalls to be avoided.
^p In particular, I believe that we
should not use films or TV in schools,
since these are emotive media likely
to play on a teenager's emotional in¬
stability, unless they are accompanied
by well-informed discussion.
^m It is very unwise to put on star-
turns by outsiders, which may gen¬
erate excessive curiosity and interest.
^p Do not say "don't" in an autho¬
ritarian fashion, for teenagers are
naturally rebellious, and your prohibi¬
tions may act as a dare.
Q Do not stress the dangers of
drugs, because taking risks is nor¬
mal among adolescents. In any case,
they will feel that the dangers "can't
happen to me".
^^ Do not give adolescents sets of
factual instructions about drugs, their
uses, effects, sizes, colours, which
invite experimentation.
^p Do not let ex-addicts tell teen¬
agers about their experiences, because
this may attract more than it deters.
It may also misleadingly suggest that
they too could always kick the habit
should they get hooked.
^P Do not give a highly complex
recital of facts about drugs and their
abuse and then leave teenagers to
make up their own minds. The avail¬
able data would need a computer to
sort out, even if all the "facts" were
true.
O And finally, do not make the
addict's mistake of elevating drugs to
a position of supreme importance; it
is surely better to play them down
as a very poor substitute for active
involvement in real life.
However well it may be conducted,
and this article only sets out one
possible approach, we should not
expect too much from drugs education
in schools. It can never be more than
a major part of a broader campaign of
public education. And that in its turn
is but one among the whole range of
measures required to combat drug
abuse.
However, it may be that just as it
has greater potential for harm, educa¬
tion has greater potential for good
than other forms of expert Intervention,
if we conceive its role broadly enough.
This means, in my view, concentrating
more on people and the sort of society
they live in than on drugs.
The pattern of adolescent abuse in
many countries suggests that it is most
widespread, not so much where drugs
are freely available, as where com¬
munity bonds and the transferring of
social norms and values to the next
generation has been most weakened
by social change.
striking feature of any
stable, self-respecting community is
the transmission of its way of life to its
children. If, as I suspect, some kind
of breakdown in this process underlies
both the youthful demand for drugs and
society's inability to handle the result¬
ing problems, then the responsibility
is primarily a community one.
We cannot push it off in the current
vogue on to the experts, though we
undoubtedly need their specialist help.
It is the responsibility of all of us not
only to convince teenagers that life
has better things to offer than drugs
but to ensure that it has.
The teaching profession can be of
more help here than all the other
experts put together. Unlike the law
enforcement agencies, the psychiatrists
and the research workers, teachers
can help us to give adolescents a
social role, to involve them in a society
that needs their positive qualities but
not their drug-taking.

Women's jobs & education
Unesco and the International Labour
Office are making an international survey
of the relationship between women's oppor¬
tunities for study and employment. The
project aims to assist countries in drawing
up national policies that offer women equal
chances in education and professional train¬
ing. Studies cover five countries: two in
Africa and one each in Latin America, the
Arab States and Asia.
10 million British books
for developing countries
Over 10 million books have been made
available to developing countries under the
English Language Book Society Low-Priced
Book Scheme in the U.K. Subsidized by
the British Government, the scheme enables
books to be sold in 57 developing countries
in Asia, Africa and the Pacific region at
between a third and a half of the normal
commercial price in Britain. Over 450 titles
are currently available in a wide range of
subjects, including engineering, agriculture,
medicine, commerce, technology, education
and English language teaching. The ten
millionth book to be produced was recently
handed over to Kenya's Minister for Educ¬
ation, Mr. Taita arap Towett, In Nairobi.
Van Gogh museum
for Amsterdam
Works by Vincent van Gogh will have a
permanent home in a new museum to be
opened in Amsterdam next month by Queen
Juliana of the Netherlands. The Vincent van
Gogh Museum will house the collection of
Dr. V.W. van Gogh, the artist's nephew,
which includes 230 paintings, 400 drawings
and van Gogh's letters to his brother Theo.
Sandor Petöfi
Hungary's poet-patriot
This year marks the 150th anniversary of
the birth of Sandor Petöfi, one of Hungary's
greatest poets and patriots. Petöfi's poetry,
characterized by realism, humour and des¬
criptive power, brought new vitality to
Hungarian literature, and one of his poems
"Talpra Magyar" (Rise Hungarian) written
on the eve of the Hungarian revolution of
1848, became the revolutionary anthem.
Mali awards
its first doctorates
Mali's higher educational system, estab¬
lished with help from Unesco and the U.N.
Development Programme, "came of age"
recently when the first Malians to earn
advanced degrees entirely through studies
in their own country were awarded doctor¬
ates from the Centre of Higher Studies in
Bamako. Mali now has an Ecole Normale
Supérieure, which trains secondary school
teachers, a Rural Polytechnic Institute, a
National School of Administration and
schools of engineering, medicine, pharmacy
and dentistry. At the Centre for Higher
Studies students can take advanced cour¬
ses in geometry, mathematics, physics, soil
microbiology and animal physiology.
U.N. nature park
in Antarctica ?
Ecology-minded officials around the globe
are examining an appeal by representatives
of 75 countries for the creation of the first
world natural park in Antarctica. The park
would be managed by the United Nations
and would protect the fauna and flora of
the southern arctic region, especially from
depredations by hunters, if action is taken
on the unanimous recommendation of last
year's Second World Conference on
National Parks, sponsored by the Inter¬
national Union for the Conservation of
Nature and Natural Resources.
Electronic device
aids Arabic typists
An electronic device which greatly simpli¬
fies typing and printing in Arabic script has
been developed by Dr. Syed Hyder, asso¬
ciate professor In the Department of Com¬
puter Science, University of Montreal,
Canada. A serious difficulty in reproducing
Arabic script on keyboard machines Is that
a letter may have several different shapes
depending on what comes before and after
it in a word. Dr. Hyder's electronic pro¬
cessor device recognizes successions of
Arabic characters and chooses the appro¬
priate shape. The operator then needs
only one key for each letter as on a
Western keyboard.
Flashes
World population reached 3,706 million
in mid-1971 at a 2 per cent annual growth
rate and an increase of 74 million in one
year, reports the latest U.N. Demographic
Yearbook. At this rate, world population
will double by the year 2006.
Malaysia Is spending 843 million Malay¬
sian dollars on education this year 163 m;7-
lion dollars more than on defence.
Soviet archaeologists have discovered
the remains of a 2,500 year old town in
the Central Asian Soviet Republic of
Tadzhikistan.
During the first U.N. Development
Decade (the 1960s) industrial production
rose by an annual average of 10.7 per
cent in countries belonging to the U.N.
Economic Commission for Asia and the
Far East.
A decade of struggle against racism
and racial discrimination is to be launch¬
ed by the U.N. General Assembly on
December 10, 1973, the 25th anniversary
of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights.

SRI AUROBINDO
AND AUROVILLE
Sir,
Allow me to congratulate you on
your excellent issue featuring articles
on Sri Aurobindo and Auroville (Octo¬
ber 1972). What particularly pleased
me was your choice of my old teacher,
Professor K. R. Srinlvasa Iyengar, for
the Aurobindo article. Professor Iyen¬
gar's knowledge of Aurobindo's life
and work is not merely academic; it
is a result of personal practice and
experience. And Aurobindo's work it¬
self, whether it is poetry or philoso¬
phy (most of the time the former is a
vehicle for the latter), is the result of
his lifelong meditation and personal
realization.
Like another Bengali mystic before
him, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, though
on a somewhat different plane, Auro¬
bindo was intensely concerned with
the destiny of man and believed that,
if he tried hard, man could transcend
the limitations that make him earth-
bound. He believed, too, that the
logical end of man's evolution is his
merger with the divine.

THE RIGHT IMAGE 7
Sir,
Do you really feel that the drawings
relating to European countries ("A
Hungarian artist looks at International
Book Year") In your October 1972 issue
are tasteful and appropriate?

LIMITS TO THE LIMITS
TO GROWTH A CLUB
OF ROME REPLY
Sir,
At the suggestion of Mr. Aurelio
Peccei, president of the Club of Rome,
I should like to comment on the arti¬
cle "Limits to the Limits to Growth"
by Gunnar Myrdal In your January 1973
issue.
In the final analysis, there is little
contradiction between Mr. Myrdal's
basic views and those of the Club
of Rome executive or even of the
"Limits" report Itself.
1. The Gross National Product con¬
cept is by no means uncritically
accepted in "Limits". As Mr. Peccei
and 1 stated In "The Limits to Growth
In Perspective" (a paper submitted at
the request of the Economic Committee
of the Parliamentary Assembly of the
Council of Europe, in December 1972):
"If the book on the limits to growth
is read carefully and with an open
mind, It becomes clear that, despite
the terms of the title, it Is not growth
as such which is at fault but the pres¬
ent kind of growth and our methods
of measuring growth."
It Is also no coincidence that the
first politician to formulate practical
proposals based on "Limits", Mr. Sicco
Mansholt former president of the Com¬
mission of the European Community,
opposed the concept of Gross Natio
nal Utility (GNU) to the Gross National
Product (GNP) concept. Unfortunately
up to now no statistical data on GNU
is available as a basis for a systematic
study such as that performed by the
MIT team.
2. The high degree of aggregation
and the preliminary nature of some of
the data used (in order not to wait
another 5 or 10 years) is a criticism
often expressed. To repeat this opi¬
nion the way Mr. Myrdal does is
surely below his standards. Would it
have been reasonable to expect the
Wright brothers to fly a Jumbo Jet?
3. The fact that "inequalities of dis¬
tribution are defined as social prob¬
lems" and placed outside the first
model simulation cannot really be con¬
strued as neglect. It was a simplifi¬
cation, necessary at that stage and
showing that even under idealized
assumptions present ecological trends
are disastrous.
4. Social interactions and institu¬
tional responses, it is true, are to be
(and are being) much more deeply
studied than two years ago, not least
because of "Limits" having empirical¬
ly demonstrated the inadequate and
too slow functioning of traditional poli¬
tical and economical "mechanisms".
5. To qualify the Interrelationship
concerning birth rates, used in the
model, as "fictitious" is a dogmatic
statement that goes against statistical
evidence. Surely, however, the issue
is much more complex than the simu¬
lation could handle; many of the quan¬
titatively still intractable and irrational
factors are acknowledged in "Limits".
6. Mr. Myrdal's feeling that "those
conclusions from the report's analysis
which are sensible at all, are not differ¬
ent and definitely not more certain
than could have been reached by...
hard simple thinking aware of the limi¬
tations of what we know", is to my
mind erroneous.
As we pointed out in "The Limits to
Growth in Perspective":
"For the first time an Instrument has
been demonstrated which Is to some
extent in keeping with the complexity
of our world and its problématique.
Never again will it be possible to
regard population, monetary matters,
industrial growth and many other prob¬
lems as autonomous areas of policy
determination.
"The fallacy has been shown of the
theory that the overall goals of a
social system are best approached by
working separately towards each sub-
goal. On the contrary, in our pres¬
ent condition every effort to enhance
one sub-goal reduces the chances of
meeting other sub-goals. The problem
is to determine the optimum compro¬
mise, not only at a national but also
at a global level."
I should like to comment also on
another article in your issue: "Envi¬
ronment and Political Commitment",
its subject being of similar nature.
The young scientists' round table meet¬
ing at Unesco was a most construc¬
tive event, and its conclusions, among
others, were summarized In the annex
of the above-mentioned paper. Two
sentences of this summary may be
quoted:
"The MIT study Is somewhat criti¬
cized for not having dealt with the
waste of armaments and for placing
too much emphasis on resource limi¬
tations rather than stating that the
real root of most ills is a crisis of
civilization: a single deep-lying prob¬
lem with many diverse symptoms.
This coincides with the Club of Rome
thinking."
As to the "a-political stance" of
"Limits", reproached by the young
scientists: measured by the impact on
public opinion and all strata of people
and by the stirring-up of politicians of
all shades, "Limits" has proved to be
eminently political in the best sense
of the word.
One aspect of its Importance, to
again quote "The Limits of Growth In
Perspective", lies in fighting against:
"...the deep-rooted tendency... of
focusing on symptoms and conse¬
quences (inequalities, world-war threat)
instead of referring to the underly¬
ing causes. It is the very nature of
the predicament that its problems are
so critically intertwined that it is not
possible to deal with any single major
issue separately and in Isolation. The
habitual kind of linear, sequential think¬
ing ('disarmament first" or 'economic
growth first") is basically wrong, and
cannot lead us out of the present
colossal impasse. Just imagine wait¬
ing for the world to be de-nuclearized
before attacking the problems of
poverty, or vice versa. Nothing has
such priority as to relegate the prob¬
lématique as a whole to second
place. All the issues have to be
dealt with, or a least understood, in
a coherent, systemic way."
With my compliments on the choice
of the subject and the presentation
of your January 1973 issue.
Manfred Siebker

BUT THEY DO I
Sir,
"Americans read more books than
Europeans" reports your February 1973
issue. My wife and I cannot understand
how they do so. Surely this is another
fallacy.

ART OF THE OUTLINE
Sir,
In publishing the beautiful shadow
portrait cut outs of Ugo Mochi, your
January 1973 issue drew attention to
an art form which interests me very
much and which I practise.
I belong to the "Compagnons de
Lure", a group of specialists in the
graphic arts. Its annual meetings, the
"Rencontres Internationales de Lurs",
are presided over by Gérard Blanchard,
author of the article "An ABC of Text
Plus Image" in your December 1972
issue.
Your world-wide readership could, I
am sure, provide a wealth of fascinat¬
ing information on this very popular art
form. Collectors, practitioners and
lovers of the art could surely compile
a bibliography, collect reproductions
and publicize this modest yet very
satisfying form of artistic expression.

"Unesco neither looks upon drugs as a specific problem of youth,
nor does it consider that the many serious problems facing youth in

The use of educational techniques as a weapon against drugs should
therefore be aimed at both young people and adults."
