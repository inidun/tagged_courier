res Bodet marks
the opening of
Unesco's Funda-
mental Education
centre at Minne-
riya, Ceylon, on
12 March.
M JAIME TORRES BODET, Director-
General of Unesco, returned last
month to Paris following a three-
week tour of the capitals and a
number of rural areas of Ceylon, Pakistan
Cind India. This was the Director-General's
tirst official visit to Southern Asia. He
inaugurated the Unesco Demonstration
Centre for Fundamental and Adult Educa-
tion at Minneriya, Ceylon ; visited the
Fundamental Education project in which
Unesco participates at Alipur, India ; and
studied the development of various other
Unesco undertakings in the three countries.
The opportunities for closer co-operation
between Unesco and its Member States were
discussed by the Director-General at
meetings with members of National Com-
missions and with other persons working to
improve educational facilities and the
general living standards of millions of men,
women and children. They were also taken
up at personal conferences between. M. Tor-
res Bodet and the Prime Ministers of Cey-
lon, Pakistan and India.
The importance of the Director-General's
trip-during which he covered 15, 800 miles
- derives in part from the vastness of the
needs of southern Asia in education, science
and culture, and the increasingly prominent
part the three countries are playing in
Unesco's major programmes, especially in
fundamental education and technical assis-
tance.
The role of Ceylon, Pakistan and India
in relation to Unesco's activities in technical
assistance is particularly striking. Out of a
total expenditure of $ 1, 251, 880 alloted for
thirteen countries benefiting from the pro-
gramme, the three countries account for
$ 453, 530 of which $ 102, 433 is for Ceylon,
$ 18 : 3, 237 for Pakistan and $ 167, 860 for
India.
It is because of growing world interest in
this area of the world, that we devote this
entire issue of the Unesco Courier to India,
Pakistan and Ceylon and some of their
achievements in the fields of education,
science and culture.

### 380022: Problems of a sub-continent

impressions that one becomes acquainted with two States,
newcomers to political independance and eager for the
modernization on which their existence depends. Their tradi-
tional environment is millinary, but their problems are modern.
Liberation has been achieved, but adaptation to the social and
economic conditions of the 20th century is proving to be more
difficult. All the questions which are stirring the India of today
spring from these two contradictory sets of conditions,
The first of these questions, facing both Pakistan and India,
is how best to create a modern state together with the
institutions and methods needed to ensure its efficient working
in a society as yet archaic.
This sub-continent, clearly bounded by the Himalayas, the
Arakan and the Ocean has continually come under the rule of
foreign conquerors : the forts of Agra and of Delhi are impressive
monuments to the Mogul power and, only yesterday. British
Viceroys governed 400, 000. 000 Indians.
In this environment dominated by a concern ; : nor
metaphysics, the notion of the State was long an alien
concept, and responsability for order rested on the authority
and competence of a handful of British civil servants. Now
that these men have left, will their Indian or Pakistan successors
be capable of administering, by western techniques, the deve-
loped State structures which they have inherited with a society
as yet largely medieval ?
Karachi and New Delhi certainly have able leaders trained
in the British school, but they lack that framework of experienced
officials on which execution primarily depends. We who live
in-an old social structure where the difference between the
highest and the lowest in a hierarchy is, in fact, trifling, cannot
easily appraise the obstacle created by a lack of officials able
to interpret an order. First-rate ministers-and India has
them-are not enough ; heads of offices are also needed.
How, one wonders, will this education of civil servants be
carried out, and will the Indian administration be able to
maintain the high level achieved by the previous regime.
Intelligence is certainly not lacking, but rather a certain
orderliness of method, a certain collective discipline in conduct.
How can an administration of the Western type operate in Asia
with a national staff ? This is certainly one of the first questions
raised in the mind of an observer.
A gigantic programme faces the new leaders of India, first
fn the modernization which is closely linked with the problem of
illiteracy and the magnificient efforts now being made to
develop the country's teaching and educational resources.
The technical and administrative work carried out by the
British was considerable-in some respects outstanding-but
the need for adequate mechanical equipment remains urgent.
Agriculture is still in the era of the camel and the medieval
cart, while the existing system of land ownership and tilling
demands (the word is not too strong) a revolution. Moreover,
the industrialization of the new country-still too exclusively
agricultural-seems indispensable, if a too numerous popu-
lation is to be given the chance of existence. This population
grows by three to four millions every year, producing surplus
mouths that no one knows how to feet, and creating an ever-
present threat of famine. Charity or assistance cannot solve
this problem without a complete reform of the economy.
Such a transformation is less urgent for Pakistan, but for
India it cannot long be delayed. Although India is now a
great industrial country, and has been for half a century, its
industrial potential is far from fully developed. The time when
its former rulers, by treating its economy as a colonial one,
arbitrarily gave it the role of exporter of raw materials and
importer of manufactured articles, has now passed.
The problem now arises which undoubtedly more than any
other troubles the India of Gandhi-when the country has ior
the first time become master of its own destiny. Is the vitally
needed technical revolution compatible, either with the peasant
and handicraft tradition, or with the requirements of the Hindu
religion (or, in the case of Pakistan, with those of the Koran) ?
The tractor will bring into India's 700. 000 villages methods of
work which may profoundly disrupt rural life. And what of the
handicraft worker on whom Gandhi, with his symbolic spinning
wheel, had founded his entire patriotic and mystic resistance to
the mechanical inroads of the West ? Can we, moreover,
disregard the fact that many reforms in hygiene and technology
only too obviously contradict a ritual tradition to which the
people are, for the most part, deeply attached ?
Sooner or later an answer must be given to these questions
which, each day, become more and more pressing. It is not
hard to foresee the attitudes likely to be taken in this respect
by the various sections of the population.
The official. and with them the intelligentsia of the
universities, give first place to the need for this modernization.
going so far at times as to treat as superstitious the religious
beliefs likely to raise opposition. The West alone is able for
the time being to give them technical advice and adequate
financial aid. But can we not sense that they would be
prepared, eventually, to turn elsewhere for such assistance ?
Officials, intellectuals and technicians are not all of India.
however. And even amongst them, it is worth noting that there
are many who may revert to the conservatism of their elders
once the enthusiasm of their youth has passed. Is it not
possible, therefore, that the religious tradition, which is so
closely linked with the ritual tradition, may once again become
the guiding influence in the country following a return to the
deep-seated feelings of the masses ? In the next popular
election which candidate will be listened to and followed tnost
closely-the one who advocates a policy of tractors, dams,
anti-famine measures, progress in hygiene, or the one who
appeals to the ancestral beliefs expressed in respected rites ?
Thus, while the real question is to learn to what extent an
Asiatic country can absorb and use the administrative and
technical methods of the West, it is also essential to know how
much the country really wants these methods and the kind of
life they imply. The values of the East are'not the same as
ours. It is not, however, a question of superiority, since there
is no proof whatsoever that the West is superior, but rather one
of efficacy. One might wish to be twenty years older so as to
see how India will act in solving these great problems which
touch the depths of a people's soul.
Studying India is like leaning
over the brink of an abyss from
which a timeless past seems to a
rise, envelop and penetrate one's
very being ; it means experiencing a
terrible climate in which life and
death intermingle, where human
density its almost pathological and
where an intense religious atmo-
sphere eloquently expresses the
primacy of the spiritual.
It is through the impact of such

### 73538: The Bonds uniting India and UNESCO

THE BONDS UNITING INDIA AND UNESCO
'V NDIA is a young nation, but
it has inherited prodi-
gious, economic and edu-
cational problems which affect
nearly 350 millions. Our illite-
racy figure is as high as 85 %.
Though 70 % of our people
work on agriculture, we are
short of foodgrains. Our
standard of living is low.
These are a few illustrations.
Our leaders are aiming at
building up a welfare state, at
improving agriculture, at in-

dustrializing the country. We
have undertaken schemes for
large-scale irrigation, scientific
research, and are building up
technical institutions to train
scientific and technical per-
sonnel. And so we look to
Unesco for all the assistance
it may render in our trans-
forming ourselves.
India has been a foundation-
member of Unesco, whose ob-
jectives have always appeated
to the Indian mind and
conscience. The delegations
to Unesco included some of
our foremost scientists and
scholars. We have set up a
National Commission to co-
operate with Unesco and carry
out its principles in our coun-
try. Above all, India believes
in the healing power of the
principles of Unesco.
We live in an age which is
torn by conflict, fear and
hatred. If we look below the
surface of political events we
become aware of the massive,
emotional currents which are
working to produce a new life
in society. At the heart of the
nature of things, there is
always a dream. The greatest
gift of life is the dream of a
higher living. At the heart
of the universe there is this
dream of justice for all men.
When the framework of
scciety becomes a cramping
prison, it explodes by the
explosive power latent in
society. This is revolution.
And every revolution causes
suffering to innocent people,
who have to pay for the atro-
cities and arrogance, laziness
and selfishness of the fore-
runners or leaders. This does
not, however, justify our em-
bracing social systems which
cramp the free spirit of the
individual. Democracy is a
balance between the organiz-
ing power of the state and the
enterprise of the individual.
Enterprise, adventure is
what saves civilization from
staleness, from boredom. A
civilization which is adven-
turous is free, vigorous, and
creative. Where adventure is
lacking, we have life without
depth ; literature without spi-
rit, science concerned with the
elaboration of details, art busy
with trivialities.
The spirit of man craves for
freedom, for co-operation.
We must elect for wisdom or
folly, for co-operation or ex-
tinction. No nation has a
monopoly of either wisdom or
folly. Unesco attemps to work
for a just and enduring peace,
for constructive adjustment of
conflicting interests. Humani-
ty's inability, nay refusal, to
use the Unesco method and
deal with the world problems
in a civilized way is the most
distressing feature of our time.
India believes in Unesco ; in
the paths of peace and co-ope-
ration.
We are using all the instru-
ments, the visual arts, theatre,
daqce, music, cinema, wireless,
etc., for this once. supreme
purpose of fostering the intel-
lectual and moral solidarity of
mankind.
Rabindranath.
Tagore 4
may 1861-August 1941)
A T every period in its longhistory India has had hu -
dreds of poets. None of
them, however, ever had as many
admirers in the West as Rabin-
dranath Tagore, who was born
just 90 years ago on May 6, 1861, in Calcutta. In
1913 the Nobel Prize for Literature confirmed his
fame. It was then discovered that the poet had
founded a school called Abode of Peace-Santim-
ketan-which he himself directed entirely, and that
it was rapidly becoming a true international university.
It was to this school that Tagore immediatly devoted
the 1 : 8000 of the Nobel Prize. Poems, novels and
plays, translated into English by the author, and into
other languages, often by í1lustrious writers, presented
"the mind of India"to a whole generation of
Occidentals. By his own countrymen, too, he was
considered a profound sage, whose words were received
with the closest attention, and his doctrine on the
relation between Indian thought and western civiliza-
tion exercised undeniable influence. The East, he said,
must accept industrialization and technical progress ;
but he considered that it was the role of'the Orient
to show that certain pernicious influences could be
avoided, and that. above all, the basic spirituality of
Eastern thought could be kept intact. H believed,
therefore, that education had a primary role to play
in this evolution, and that its fundamental object was
"not merely to give us information, but make our life
In harmony with all existence". Then came 1914.
Tagore raised his voice on behalf of frustrated and
oppressed justice :"There is a moral law in this
world", he reminded the warring peoples,"which has
its applications both two individuals and organized
bodies of men. You cannot go on violating these
laws in the name of your nation, yet enjoy their
advantages as individuals. We may forget truth for
our convenience, but truth does not forget us... Until
man can feet the unity of mankind, the kind of
barbarism which you call civilization will exist.'"Until
his death Tagore showed no mercy towards natio-
nalism, which he termed"that dominant intellectual
abstraction". But he offered a glimpse of hope of a
world transfigured,"when the diverse races and the
nations have evolved their perfected distinct cha-
racteristics but all attached to the stem of humanity
by the bond of lore".
Muhammad
Iqbal
it., f). la : : -April 193-81
nt PHAMMAB Iqbal is reveredby the people of Pakistan
as one of the founders of
their country. His poetry often
predicted the independent State
and in a celebrated speech deli-
vered at Allahabad in 1930 he openly demanded it.
But the appeal of his poetry, as yet little known
outside of Pakistan, rises above all frontiers. For
Iqbal is not only a great Pakistani poet and a great
Muslim poet ; he wrote for all mankind. His verse
composed either in Urdu or ancient Persian, remained
faithful to traditional forms, but it added a new
conception of the lyric with profoundly moving mes-
sages : a passionate desire for a world-wide culture,
a great faith in the destiny of man, a belief in
man's ability to develop and climb to ever higher
peaks of perfection. For Iqbal the true aim of art
was to make human life rich and beautiful. He had
no patience with people who talked of art for art's
sake-"There should be no opium eating in Art".
he once said. Art is not a pastime of intellectual,
but must"serve life"since the poet is endowed with
a mission. He himself may have hesitated before
defining his own mission. But his journey to Europe
from 1905 to 1908 revealed it to him as the search for
a great spiritual faith-which he felt was alone capable
of combatting the injustices of the modern world. He
became the lyric and philosophic poet of Beauty and
Love and their struggle against human wickedness
- oppression and cupidity. The East. he said, must
find itself and at the same time find its lost heritage.
By the East, he meant especially Islam, which he
denied as a total abandonment to God, and an active
co-operation with divine forces. He quoted the
Prophet :"The Earth does not belong tò kings or
ruters, but to God. Indignation or anger may have
at times appeared in the dialogues between East and
West which he used in his poetry, but never sterile
hostility. On the contrary, he saw in the union of
apparently opposing cultures the foundation of true
progress. Unite the spirit of logic with mystic love.

In the West Intellect is the source of life,
In the East Love is the basis of life.

The Central Ministry of Education is now embarked on a large-scale
programme for rural and adult education to reduce India's high
percentage of illiteracy.

### 73539: Pakistan: spiritual home and national reality

MAY 95t
PAKISTAN
Spiritual Home and
National Reality
Page 5-UNESCO COURIER
OF all the countries which makeup our inhabited globe, Pakis-
tan is perhaps the one which
presents the most unusual characte-
ristics. The laws defining its exis-
tence declare that it was founded as
a State where all Moslems could live
accordir. g to the principles of Islam.
As such, it provides a spiritual home
for all members of a single religious
community regardless of their na-
tional origin. Nevertheless, Pakis-
tan remains in the deepest sense of
the word a nation. It groups under
one unified authority lands that for
thousands of years have been inha-
bited by the same people, most of
whom have shared for centuries the
same moral, political and religious
principles forming the basis of the
new State.
This dual aspect-the spiritual
home and the national reality-
characterizes the Pakistan of today.
It explains too, certain paradoxes.
For although Pakistan's hope is to
bring together Moslems from all
over pre-partition India, in reality
40 million Moslems-or roughly 30
per cent of the total number-are
still scattered in other parts of the
sub-continent.
As a nation, Pakistan has defined
frontiers and distinctive geographic
and sociological features. As a spi-
ritual home, it somewhat anticipates
its national individuality. For it
must mould itself-with undimi-
nished creative zeal-in the image
of the great promise it wishes to be,
not only for its own people but also
for all those who some day may
come seeking a means of life in
keeping with their faith.
The Golden Fibre
o NE has only to glance at a map tounderstand the complexity of
the problems confronting this nation
which has set itself such lofty requi-
rements. Not only do a thousand
miles of Indian territory split East
and West Pakistan but differences
in climate, physiography and even
language separate the two regions.
Eastern Pakistan, though by far the
smaller area, has the larger popula-
tion ; yet it is West Pakistan, which is
less fertile, that compensates for the
food shortages of the eastern zone.
This zone (East Bengal) is almost
entirely devoted to the cultivation of
jute-the crop which enables the
government to balance its national
budget.
Pakistan happens to hold practi-
cally a world monopoly of raw jute
but not only is the country unable
to convert the fibre for lack of any
jute-goods industry but inadequate
port facilities even impede its expor-
tation. (1).
To remedy this situation, the Go-
vernment has embarked on a series
of vast industrialization projects for
the construction of the first jute
mills at Narayanganj, a hydro-elec-
tric dam and a paper mill on the
Karnafully-River, additional port
facilities at Chittagong, a new port
at the Ganges Delta, power stations
at Malakand, and sugar refineries at
Mardan.
But the immense problems of fi-
nancing these projects and of trans-
forming a large portion of illiterate
peasants into technically and socially
educated workmen present formi-
dable obstacles. Here United Na-
tions and Unesco Technical Assis-
tance and U. S. Point IV programmes
may help in meeting some of the
difficulties.
8, 000, 000 Refugees
PARTITION and with it the indepen-dence of Pakistan brought in its
wake immense misery and suffering.
Since 1947, eight million refugees
have trekked into West Pakistan
(Sind and Punjab) from all parts of
India, leaving behind them every-
thing they cherished-their person-
al belongings, their fortunes, their
land and the tombs of their ancestors
- in order to join the spiritual com-
munity of their own choosing :
Despite the efforts of the Central
Government, hundreds of thousands
of these refugees still live in condi-
tions that defy description. Undoub-
tedly material aid must first be given
to the adults ; but surely the problem
of re-adapting and rehabilitating
the children is no less important
than that of other children during
and after the last world war when
psychologists, sociologists, psychia-
trists and educators from all over
SILVER FIBRE. Just as jute is regarded as the"golden fibre"of East Pakistan, cotton is the
sliver fibre"of West Pakistan. About 90% of the cotton crop is grown under irrigation mostly
from canals fed by the river Indus and the three Punjab rivers.
GOLDEN FIBRE. A cartlod of jute-Pakistan's'go) den fibre-on its way to the market.

the world joined to find a solution.
Similar problems-and others
even more specialised-also face
East Bengal. To solve them will re-
quire no small degree of imagina-
tion and international collaboration.
For even the most intensive jute cul-
tivation cannot be expected to absorb
the manpower or assure the liveli-
hood of a population which exceeds
in density 2, 500 inhabitants per
square mile. In fact, for centuries
the people have sought a secondary
means of income in cottage indus-
tries such as the manufacture of
muslin cloth which has made Dacca
famous. But even these rural crafts
are conditioned by unique circums-
tances. They depend on interna-
tional markets not only as a source
for raw materials but as a sales
outlet for the finished products
To take a specific case, in East
Bengal I recently visited a number
of villages of incredible poverty
in the region of Langalbund not far
from Dacca. There, over 50, 000
people live only by the manufacture
of mother-of-pearl buttons. These
buttons, of the kind used for cheap
shirts and underwear, are produced
in huge quantities by hand tools
which might well have belonged to
the early Middle Ages.
The raw materials needed for their
production such as chemicals, card-
board and the foil spangles used to
mount the buttons on the cardboard,
have ceased coming in from abroad
since Pakistan became independent.
Following a world slump in demand,
pearl button production in the vil-
lages has declined from 60, 000 gross
pe week to less than 50, 000 per
month, while the price paid to the
village craftsman has fallen 75 per
cent.
This is only one example of the
distressing problems facing Pakistan
today. It would be a mistake, how-
ver, to view them merely as econo-
mic problems. No doubt the key to
the dilemma lies first with the tech-
nicians.
Synthesis 01 Humanity
poR example, the material condi-tions of the Bengali peasant
could be almost unbelievably im-
proved by the introduction of small,
specially manufactured, hand ope-
rated machines. These would sim-
plify the different stages of work
in the button industry. But
who, better than Unesco can draw
the attention of scientists and techni-
cians to the fact (which they so often
tend to overlook) that the purposes
of science are not only to solve
scientific problems but to find an-
swers to social problems as well. The
efforts of science should not only
enable mankind to surpass itself ;
they must also help those who lag
behind to catch up.
A young nation founded on an an-
cient civilization, Pakistan like other
nations of Asia or America, synthe-
sizes in its problems the whole of
human development. At one and the
same time, it suffers and lives in our
Middle Ages which its villages per-
petuate ; in our 18th and 19th centu-
ries which its first attempts at indus-
trialization reproduce ; in our 20th
century whose advantages it is deter-
mined to secure. Perhaps the more
developed nations, by providing Pa-
kistan with some of the means to
bridge these gaps and overcome such
contradictions, may learn in return
how man can succeed in attaining
his full individual stature without
denying any part of his heritage and
of his past.

### 73540: The Culture of India

I
HUMAN civilization cannot be class : fied under a number of mutually exclusive
t-j heads. Like the colours in the solar prism, they gradually shade off one into
another, and in totality present a colour harmony where nevertheless some
distinct colour types are noticeable. These are different, no doubt, but not anta-
gonistic. We thus can easily note a number of types in present-day civilization, as
they can be noted for the earlier periods of history. Under each of these general
types there are a number of sub-types, or attached types which present among
themselves diversities of variations, but show likenesses due to genetic reasons or to
affiliation. Taking note of those types which have an international implication or
significance, embracing peoples different in their original race and language, we may
say that Four Distinct Types of Civilization now prevail in the world. These arse- (1 J
the Eur-American,- (2) the Islamic, (3) The Chinese, and. (4) the Indian. At least this
is how it strikes us in India. And there is also a good deal of over-lapping, giving
rise to complexities which sometimes lead to conflict and are sometimes harmonized.
The culture of India is a great complex,
perhaps in its roots and its implications
the greatest complex of its kind in the
world. And in its complexity it is like
life itself. It is vast as Nature herself,
Nature as she has been manifested in the
minor continent of India. In its all-
inclusiveness, it may be compared to a
tropical forest.
The geographical boundaries of India
(I use India to mean the geographical and
cultural entity that has always been so
known since ancient Greek times, includ-
ing both the States of India and Pakistan)
make the country rather like a pocket,
where whatever ethnic stocks arrive, stay
on to attain a complete development,
participating in the life already existing
in the country and enriching it with new
elements and contributions.
According to the most recent pronoun-
cement of authorities in the matter, six
distinct racial groups with their separate
speeches belonging to four speech-families
have co-mingled in blood and culture to
give rise to the people of India and to
the characterized culture or civilization of
India. The process began at least five
thousand years ago, and was accomplished
some two thousand years ago, but it
continued for some centuries more to
function and to spread and consolidate
the completed culture over the whole of
India and over what have been called the
lands of Greater Indian, in South-eastern
Asia and in Central Asia.
After 700 A. D., and particularly after
1200 A. D., it came in contact with Islam
- first the Islam of the Arab in Sindh,
and afterwards the Islam of the Turk
and the Persian in the Punjab. These
brought about a profound change in the
fortunes of this culture. In the l6th-
17th centuries, Modern European and
Christian influences touched the fringe of
Indian culture in some coastal areas when
the Portuguese established themselves in
Goa and in a few other seaport towns,
in Western India as well as in Bengal.
But Portuguese influences were not deep
enough, and the real contact with
European culture started after the English
became the masters of Bengal in 1757
and subsequently established their empire
over the whole of India.
Indian culture in its broadest conno-
tation would include all that has been
achieved in the domain of thought and
the good life by the people of India, as
a whole or in groups, ever since the
foundations of a common life, common
traditions, common way of thinking and
a common attitude were laid by the most
important component elements of the

Indian people (the Austric, the Dravidian
and the Aryan speaking groups), beginn-
ing to form in the Upper Gangetic
Plains a single people with a single Aryan
speech. The culture that took shape in
this way round the beginning of the first
millennium B. C. took another five hun-
dred years to be fully characterized, and
a further five hundred years to expand
from the Ganges Valley to the whole
of India.
At the beginning of the Christian era,
and it may be even a few centuries ear-
lier, we have a Pan-Indian culture fully
established. This culture has been, for
want of a better term, described as
Ancient Indian, or Ancient Hindu, with
its three important philosophical and
religious expressions, viz., Brahmanical,
Buddhist and Jaina. It was not the
creation of a single section only of the
Indian people. It was not an Aryan
culture, to start with, which was imposed
by a superior civilized, white Aryan or
Indo-European speaking people upon
backward or savage, darkskinned, non-
Aryan aboriginals, as it was at one time
fondly believed. It was in fact the joint
creation of the Aryan and non-Aryan
- elements were contributed by all,
which were combined into one single type.
The Significant Contribution
0 ! Indian Civilization
IDEAS like SMmsdrat, or transmigrationand Karmâ, or a man's actions de-
termining his fate, the mysticism of Yôga
with its special discipline and practices,
the doctrine of Bhakti or devotion to God
- all these developed in an atmosphere of
co-operation between Aryan and non-
Aryan. And those who built up the struc-
ture of Hindu philosophy in its various
schools, the Brahmans and others of North
India (of mixed origin themselves)
profited by the diversity of point of view
presented by the different racial elements.
The theory of caste, stressed division of
mankind according to their qualities or
character (guna) and their avocations
(parma), and not according to race (a
Brahman so born was no Brahman unless
he went through certain ceremonies, and
certain other ceremonies also exalted
people to a higher position).
Apart from certain material and intel-
lectual contributions made by India
to the sum total of Human culture (these
contributions have been accepted and now
form permanent parts of the human
heritage the significant contribution of
Indian civilization by which India can E
still serve humanity lies in her philosophy I
and her attitude to life, in seeking to I
model human relations on certain spirit-
tual bases
"He who sees all creatures in himself,
And himself in all creatures, then he does
not dislike or hate (anybody)."
(Isa-Upanisad.)
Being after all a human production or 
creation, Indian civilization cannot claim 
to be the sole repository of any particular
idea or set of ideas, or behaviour or sets,
of behaviours, which are not found else-t
where among other civilizations. Then
greatest things thought or said or done,.
by people in India have also their echoes'
or counterparts in other lands among,
other people.

literature and its ancillary literatures in various
the ancient and modern provincial lan- :
guages of India give an expression to,
these ideas and the lessons, in part or in ;

all its diverse elements is the result of I
the implicit acceptance of the ideology of 1
Sanskrit literature at its highest and most j
universal. The cultural history of the I
various peoples in India in ancient and]
mediaeval times is the progressive

ideas (the higher spiritual thought and
mystic experience of Islam, based on J
elements of love and beauty and certain 1
deeper philospical speculations from Greek]
Neo-platonic philosophy and the Indian1
Vedanta) have supplied a common plat-Satya-j
form for Indianism and Islam ; and the' ;

Christianity has made an understanding
between Indian thought and culture and
Christian culture feasible. f {

This sense of Unity and Harmony
which represents the most specifier

This Unseen Reality is both immanentx' !
and transcendent. It embraces life and

3) An Urge to realize this Ultimate

Life which finds its outlet in the negative
doctrine of Ahimsa or Non-injury and the
positive one of Karunâ or Sense of Pity
and Mâitrî of Active Charity.
7) A great Tolerance for all other
beliefs, experiences and points of view.
Indian Culture in its broad and universal
aspect, as distinguished from the narrow
sectarian points of view, recognizes that
Ithe Ultimate Reality manifests itself in
'various forms, and that Truth is
approachable by diverse paths, and as
such does not insist upon or inculcate a
particular creed which must be accepted
by all. It believes that man can attain
to the summun bonum in life through the
best that is available in his environment
followed in a spirit of sincerity and
charity. The Ultimate Truth does not
pin itself down to the experiences or
opinions of any single individual, but it is
expressed in the experiences of the sum
total of humanity.
Looked at from the point of view of
man in his striving to know the truth and
to do, the good, the three basic ideas of
Indian Culture can be summarized in
the words-Samanvaya or Synthesis,
Satya-jijnâsâ or Desire to know the
Truth, and Ahimsâ or Non-injury.
The Great Weakness
Indian Culture
p ARADOxicALLY enough, the great weak-ness of Indian culture lies in what
is its greatest strength-its all-inclusive-
ness frequently conduces to absence of
zeal or conviction, and tends to'make
people prone to compromise and to yield.
Those who follow a narrower and a more
circumscribed path are found to be
stronger and better disciplined in struggle,
frequently aggressive struggle. The In-
dian may be taught to tread the path of
the Gods in cultivating a frame of mind
au-dessus de la mêlée ; but unless he has
braced himself with the manly doctrine
of the Bhagavad-Gita to fight for the
good, it takes a good deal of suffering and
"aerifice for him before he can stiffen
himself into resistance. As a philosophy
It is certainly on a higher plane, but as
'I practical doctrine it has its dis-
advantages. Yet the compromise bet-
wees the highest thought and practical
Ipplication was arrived at and consciously
nculcated in Indian life. But thought
'rather than élan in action marks the
: haracteristic Indian effort.
With this wide sweep seeking to
embrace all, this sense of under-
stranding and sympathy, this acceptance
if the position that"diversity of thought
s a part of the scheme of things and is
) uite in keeping with the scheme of
Mature in other directions", it is no
wonder that Indian Culture should be able
o leaven the thoughts and views of other
'copies who come to know it and did not
lismiss it with impatience but sought to
mderstand what it had to say and to
; ive. For the greater part of a
nillennium, Indian culture and thought
ormed the guiding spirit in the intellec-
ual and spiritual aspirations of the
xeater part of Asia-in what have been
yell called the lands of Greater India-

Ceylon, which culturally is but a projec-
tion of India ; Burma ; the lands of Indo-
China-particularly Siam, Cambodia and
Champa or Old Cochin China ; and the
islands of Indonesia ; besides ancient East-
ern Iran, Central Asia, and Thibet.
The sister-civilization of China (supply-
ing, with Indianism and Islam, one of
the three mainsprings of civilization in
Asia), also received its full share of the
Indian spirit through Buddhism, and pass-
ed it on to Korea and Japan and to Giao-
Chi or Viet-Nam. Tibet developed the
elements it received of Indian culture in
her own way, and passed it on to Mon-
golia.
The question of the influence of
Indianism on the Hellenic World is
problematical, as Indianism was develop-
ing contemporaneously with Hellenism.
From the days of Alexander the Great,
the Indian gymnosophists or recluses
impressed the Greek mind, and there is
evidence of contact between Greek
thought and Indian thought from at least
the 5th century B. C., and particularly in
the 3rd century B. C.-earlier contacts are
not proved (e. g. the indebtedness of
Pythagoras and the earlier Greek philo-
sophers to Indianism). India was indebted
to Greece for an advance in astronomical
knowledge, although the helio-centric
theory of planetary world was her own
discovery.
When the intellectual centre of Islam
at Baghdad became a great clearing house
of science and thought and material or
technical advancement through the Arabic
language, India made substantial contri-
butions in mathematics and astronomy,
in medicine, in certain arts and crafts,
and in the spheres of mental and
spiritual culture also-in literature (the
beast fable with a moral and the mar-
vellous and romantic tale, which found a
place in world literature through the
popularity in the European world of
versions based on Arabic), and in mysti-
clam.
Indianism
III The Modern World
I NDIANlSM has now entered a new phasea force in"the development of
universal civilization and of man's hyma-
nistic conceptions". Contact with the
European mind at the beginning of the
last century quickened the Indian
intellect and brought about a renaissance
of the Indian spirit. The scientific
curiosity of the West established Orient-
alism Studies as intellectual disciplines
beside the study of the Classical Human-
ities, and the attempt at a just estimate
of the Indian contribution to human
culture on the part of European savants
filled Indian scholars with a spirit of
emulation in understanding and ap-
praising the bases of their own civiliz-
ation. Sir William Jones, the illustrious
founder of the Asiatic Society of Bengal
in 1784, was thus a great benefactor not
only for Indians but for the whole of
Humamty.
Raja Ram Mohan Roy was the first to
take his stand as a modern and
cosmopolitan Indian who offered to the
world the Upanishads as India's great
contribution. Ramakrishna Parama-
hamsa, Hindu saint and devotee, under-
lined the universality of Hindu religious
thought and ideals, and his disciple
Swami Vivekananda by this first public
proclamation before the West at the
Congress of Religions in Chicago in the
year 1893 inaugurated a movement for
the understanding and wider application
in practical life of the Indian Vedanta
philosophy.
Other great personalities came up before
the international lorum as harmonizers
between the spirit of man and its
expression through Indianism-Rabindra-
nath Tagore, Mohandas Karamchand
G a n d h i. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan,
among others. Rabindranath's interna-
tionalism, which he considered as the best.
expression of Indianism and his sense of
perception of the Ultimate Reality
through Nature and Life, so beautifully
expressed in his poetry, have been accept-
ed and appreciated by the cultural
elite all over the world. Radhakrishnan's
insistence on the idealistic aspect of life
as set forth by Indian thought has also
been received with growing conviction by
men of thought everywhere. And Gan-
dhi's doctrine of Non-violence (Ahimsa)
and Holding Fast to Truth (Satyâgraha)
is looked upon with increasing interest by
thinkers of the present day.
In England, in America, on the Conti-
nent (in Germany, in Scandinavia, in
Holland, and in France, as well as else-
where), the leaven of Indianism appears
to be at work, slowly and imperceptibly,
through translations of capital works of
Indian thought and culture and through
ancillary literature of various kinds. The
internationalism or cosmopolitanism of
India is something which suggests her
entire personality. And at the present
day, the message of India as expressed in
the philosophy of the Vedanta and in the
imaginative and emotional rationalism of
Hinduism with regard to the fundamental
basis of existence, is bringing something
which-judging from current trends in
thought and culture in Europe and Ame-
rica-both the heart and the intellect of
Modern Man everywhere is craving for.

### 73542: India's chain of national research laboratories

Drug research in one of India's new national chemical laboratories
recently set up in different parts of the sub-continent. Above, Indian
scientists at work on penicillin production at the Haffkine Institute in
Bombay. Unesco is helping to extend such scientific research work.
India's Chain of National
Research Laboratories
THE chain of national laboratoriesnow being set up in India has
been described by Prince Min-
ister Pandit Nehru as'"the founda-
tions of progress". His words are a
recognition of the fact that no mod-
ern State can hope to raise the
standard of living of its people and
strengthen its position in world
economy, without a wise and full
employment of science.
Dr. S. S. Bhatnagar, F. R. S., Direc-
tor Indian Council of Scientific and
Industrial Research, has made it
clear that these laboratories will
undertake work that is not ordina-
rily within the scope of industry.
Their approach to industrial pro-
blems will be from a national point
of view rather than just from the
outlook of particular industries.
Without being restricted by ideas
of immediate financial gain, the
laboratories will be in a better posi-
tion to employ suitable talent and
try new approaches to problems.
Matters with wide social and
economic aspects will be carried out
by State scientific research. The
laboratories will aim at improving
industrial processes, so as to increase
efficiency of production and develop
new industries in India.
There are to be 11 national labora-
tories, each dealing with a specific
industrial activity. They have been
planned not only for today, but also
for the future. The buildings
have been de-
signed to allow
for expansion,
and the equip-
ment is the most
up-to-date.
A completely new feature is the
provision of pilot plants, which bring
research to a point where its possi-
bilities for commercial exploitation
can 00 demonstrated.
The largest of the national labora-
tories is the National Physical Labo-
ratory in New Delhi where research
will be directed at the fullest use of
India's raw materials. It will have
the country's first electron micros-
cope, as well as facilities for research
in radar, meteorology, cosmic rays
and the planetary system.
The laboratory is making preci-
sion instruments-for example, a
beta ray spectrograph for studying
beta-radiation from radioactive ma-
terials. Other investigations deal
with the determination of nuclear
magnetic moments by resonance of
microwaves and dispersion and
absorption of ultrasonics in liquids
and the study of luminescence of
rare earths for use in luminous
paints.
The National Chemical Laboratory
at Poona, with its seven specialized
divisions is the link between scienti-
fic institutions and industry. Inves-
tigations include experiments on
pure gelatine as a substitute for
blood plasma in surgery, and the
preparation of a drug called hepa-
rine, derived from cattle liver.
By
Maurice Goldsmith
Processes for the manufacture of
citric acid, calcium glucenate and
vitamin C have also been devel-
oped.
In the inorganic division, new and
quicker methods of estimating rare
metals and minerals are being devel-
oped. Experiments are also being
conducted on the
technical uses of
non-edible oils.
The Fuel Re-
search Institute
at Digwadih (in
the Jharia coalfields of Bihar) has
undertaken a survey of the country's
coal to assess quality and quantity,
and its most effective use. Work is
also being done on Indian oils and
fuels derived from coal, wood and
alcohol. The Institute will be assist-
ed by six field stations in the coal-
field.
The other institutes are those of
Glass and Ceramics, Metallurgy,
Food Technology, Drug Research,
Leather Research, Building Rese-
arch, Road Research, and Electro-
Chemical Research.
To help, the Government during
1950 agreed to forego customs duty
on scientific apparatus and equip-
ment. This concession follows an
earlier one allowing an industry to
deduct research work expenditure
from income tax returns. From the
Rs. 2, 500, 000 thus collected, the
industry was able to set up the Silk
and Art Silk Mills Research Asso-
ciation.
Of great importance was the pu-
blication last year of the second
volume of Wealth of India, which
gives detailed information about the
country's raw materials and indus-
tries. Two volumes of the National
Register of Scientific and Technical
Personnel have also been published.

AUnesco technical assistance teamarrives in Pakistan this month to
co-operate with the Government in
harnessing the natural resources in that
country, both above and below ground.
The leader of the mission, which is
part of Unesco's S 2, 300, 000 programme
of technical aid in 1951, is Dr. Gunnar
Norgaard, forty-seven year old Danish
geodesy expert who reached Karachi in
April. He is the advance guard of a
four-man team requested by the Pakis-
tani Government for its scientific research
programme aimed at stepping up agri-
cultural, mining and industrial produc-
tion.
Before his departure for Pakistan,
Dr. Norgaard explained that his main
task will be to assist Pakistani scientists
in mapping their country and thus lay
the foundation of future prospecting for
petroleum and other mineral resources.
The other three members of the team
are Michael Fournier d'Albe, a British
physicist now conducting research in
France, Henry 1. S. Thirlaway, a British
scientist teaching in Australia and Karl
Wienert, a German geophysicist.
They will aid in attempting to raise the
amount of rainfall on marginal land now
unsuited for agriculture, and in deter-
mining what regions are most vulnerable
to earthquakes and what can be done to
adapt building construction to these
conditions.
The budget of the mission includes
$ 35, 000 for scientific equipment to be
used in Pakistan. Five fellowships for
Pakistani scientists also will be offered.
In addition to this mission, Pakistan is
scheduled to receive technical assistance
this year from Unesco in the field of

enough to have fine buildings and
good apparatus. As Professor J. D.
Bernal said at the, opening of the
National Physical Laboratory,
"Science is not for appearance and
prestige, but for work-and that
work depends ultimately on men.
Recognizing the importance of scien-
tific workers and giving them the)
opportunity of doing their best for
the country, should be the first
considerations.
"A country like India cannot
afford to lose even one trained
scientific worker, nor can it, in the
long run, do without the services of
the many thousands more of poten-
tial scientists which better education
could provide."
Unesco, through its programme of
technical assistance for economic
development, is lending India a
helping hand in getting the chain of
national laboratories under way.
Last November, an agreement was
signed by the Indian Government
and Unesco, under which India will
receive the services of an interna-
tional team of ten research workers
for her national laboratories.
These scientists include specialists
in plastics, low temperature physics,
electrical engineering, mechanical
engineering, hydraulics, and photo-
elastic studies. Their mission fits
into Unesco's belief that economic
development, to be sound, must have
a firm foundation in science and
education.
The setting-up of these national
laboratories will benefit all aspects
of Indian life-industry, the uni-
versities, the villages. It is a conti-
nuation of the great tradition of
Indian science, which in the past
has made outstanding contributions
to world knowledge and progress.
The National Physical Laboratory at Delhi is one of tne ! argest. most moaern scientific institu-
tions in all Asia. Opened in January, 1950, the laboratory s directed at making the fullest use
of India's raw materials. It has fach. u. s, o. research in many fields including radar.. ;. eogy
and cosmic rays. This laboratory is also mking various kinds of precision instruments.

taken shows that the population is
361. 820, 000 while that of Pakistani is
75, 697, 000-a combined total 01437, 500, 000
people now living in the sub-continent.
This is an increase in 10 years, when the
last census was taken, 01 42, 000, 000

statistics point to the urgent need for
measures to increase agricultural produc-

### 73545: Prince Jai Singh and his XVIIIth century observatories

PRINCE JAI SINGH
and his XVlllth century observatories
THE SAMRAT YANTRA.-Emperor of Instruments"-is oriented in a North-South direction so as
to point at the Pole Star. The observer's post at the uppermost point is 65 feet above the grouna.
EARLY in the 18th century, an Indian
Prince, Jai Singh-descendant of the
"Sons of the Sun"-conceived and
carried out a piau to erect a series of
observatories unparalleled in his time. Even
today, the purity of line and abstract form
of the structures he built, offer one of the
most remarkable examples of astronomical
architecture.
The Prince-Maharajah of Amber-was
a member of one of the ancient and legend-
ary dynasties that made Rajputana great.
Mathematics, astronomy and architecture
were his greatest interests, and in these fields
he was regarded as one of the most talented
men of his day.
Prince Jai Singh studied deeply the
treatises of the Hindu astronomer Varaha
Mihira, read occidental works on trigono-
metry and on the drawing up and use of
logarithmic tables, and translated Greek and
Arabic works into Sanscrit. His inquiring
mind and his enthusiasm for science enabled
him to contribute to his country's greatness
in this field.
His urge to learn more of the scientific
discoveries in the Western world caused him
to send one of his principal astronomers and
mathematicians to the court of the King of
Portugal. In return the King sent Xavier
da Silva to the Prince, and presented him
with tables drawn up by the French astro-
nomer, de la Hire.
Open-Air Observatories
PRINCE JAI SINGH considered the availableastronomical data of his time inade-
quate. Even the famous tables of the
Sultan Mirza Ulugh Beg of Samarkand, he
felt, were out of date. So, he decided to
draw up new and more accurate ones.
Between 1710 and 1730, therefore, he
ordered the construction of five observatories
- at Jaipur, Delhi, Mathura, Benares and
at Ujjain, a town situated on the main
meridian of India, on the Tropic of Cancer
- so that the observations and calculations
made by his astronomers and mathe-
maticians could be verified and cor-
roborated.
Today is, Jaipur City, which Prince Jai
Singh founded in 1728, the remarkable
structures which made up one of these five
open-air observatories, provide a record in
stone of the scientific progress for which
this mathematician and astronomer is
famous.
Jaipur City itself, with its wide and
regular streets,. which divide it into six
blocks, its painted houses and its crenellated
walls overhung by rugged hills, is a monu-
ment to the energy and progressive efforts of
the Prince.
When he ordered the building of the ob-
servatories, Prince Jai Singh planned to use
types of apparatus made of metal, but find-
ing these unsatisfactory, he had huge new
instruments construted in stone. The size
of these was intended to facilitate more
accurate studies and readings of stellar space
and time.
"Emperor of Instruments"
SOME of the structures, such as theSamrat Yantra,"the emperor ofinstrument", are as much as 65 feet
high, run 130 feet in length from North to
South and are proportionately wide from

Other instruments are in the form of twin,
complementary constructions. Open spaces
in one are reproduced in the masonry of the
other, to permit easy reading at any point,
so that in fact, these double instruments
form one.

of two partitioned cylindrical structures,

since ancient times, has urged man to extend
the field of his knowledge and to explore
and understand the great universe that sur-

and the grandiose scale of time and space in
the starry universe, man has patiently tried
to understand his role and his destiny by
creating and perfecting the means of obser-
vation, study and measurement.

to explore the infinite realms of space. As
such, he belongs to that company of great
men who have affirmed the primacy of the
universal, and who, despite all obstacles,
have achieved by scientific co-operation a
living brotherhood of the mind.

### 73548: A New chapter opens in the life of rural Ceylon

A New Chapter Opens In The Life
Of Rural Ceylon
by Dr. D. Spencer Hatch
or. Spencer Hatch who is directing the work of Unesco's Minneriyai J Centre, is a veteran of thirty years in rural educati n work and
an outstanding leader in this field.
Dr. Hatch, an American, first began to work in under-developed
regions in 1922 when the International Committee of the Young Men's
Christian Association sent him to Martandam, in the Indian state of
Travancore. There he developed the concept of a rural centre to
demonstrate simple new methods of raising living standards.
Dr. Hatch returned to the United States in 1940, but left immediately
for Mexico to establish more rural centres. Later he joined the Inter-
American Institute of Agricultural Sciences to head its rural extension
work in Costa Rica.
Prior to directing the Ceylon centre, Dr. Hatch was a Unesco adviser
In rural education to the Indian Government.
CENTURIES ago, the area ofCey Ceylon k own today as the
North Central Province, was
a flourishing land, whose abundant
harvests, made possible by a large-
scale irrigation system, gave it the
name of"granary of the East".
Long years of neglect, a low
rainfall and the prevalence of
malaria, however, gradually turned
this"dry zone"into a wasteland,
forcing the bulk of Ceylon's popu-
lation into what is now called the
"wet zone".
Today, a new chapter is opening
in the life of the people of rural
Ceylon, not only for those in the
malarial jungles of the North
Central Province-acknowledged
to be the poorest of all-but for
those crowded to excess into the
"wet zone"areas.
The change is being brought about
through a large-scale government
programme of settling new regions
to ease population pressure on
overcrowded land, and the latest
contribution to this plan is the
creation of a Unesco-Governmenf of
Ceylon Rural Fundamental Education
Centre recently opened by M. Jaime
Torres Bodet, Unesco's Director-
General, at Minneriya.
Village"Laboratories"
MrNNERIYA is the centre of acolonization experiment begun
by the Ceylon Government as
part of its resettlement programme,
in which special emphasis has been
laid on improved agricultural me-
thods. The opening of the funda-
mental Education demonstration
centre there means the beginning of
a new march forward-education-
al, cultural and scientific-which
will not only help the people of that
area, but will also be an example to
other parts of Ceylon as well as to
other countries with similar pro-
blems.
But the men, women and children
who will most immediately benefit
from the work of the Minneriya
Centre are those who live within a
twenty mile radius and whose vil-
lages constitute a.'laboratory"for
the Centre's extension programme.
Just how badly they need help was
shown by a report of the Lanka
Mahila Samiti, a women's rural
improvement organization, working
in the North Central Province and
other parts of Ceylon.
This report stated, in part :
"The North Central Province was
once the seat of Lanka's Kings and
the granary of the East. Then
ensued long centuries of neglect.
Today, her average villages present
a sad picture... Centuries of ma-
laria-ridden life have made the
North Central Province peasant
apathetic to outside interests. A
resigned inertia is the result. It is
not to be wondered at, for it is the
logical outcome of a life utterly at
the mercy of nature.
"Only the land means life to them.
Paddy and chena crops are their sole
source of income, and the terribly
wasteful barter system still reigns
dominant in this province where
subsidiary incomes are absolutely
essential, but do not exist...
"A good number of peasants are
debt-ridden, leaving them neither
progressively independent, self-res-
pecting nor self-supporting. Most
villages have no roads and are
therefore cut off from the available
amenities provided by the Govern-
ment. Patients die on the way to
the nearest medical institution or die
because of their superstitious dislike
Jf medical aid. Except the younger
generation, the majority of North
Central Province folk, especially the
women, can neither read nor write."
There are many villages like those
described above. Some have a mixed
population, others are inhabited by
Singhalese or mainly by Tamils,
Mohammedans or aboriginal Ved-
dahs. The Veddahs were formerly
nomads who wandered from place to
place in the jungle. Now, however,

sections of them are settling down
in villages and are beginning regular
cultivation. It is they, above all,
who need all types of fundamental
education with special emphasis on
basic agriculture and animal hus-
bandry.
The Jungle Is Cleared
THE Minneriya Colony, where thenew Fundamental Education
Centre has been set up, is a
symbol of new hope for such people,
for it has shown in recent years how
practicial ideas and strenuous efforts
can work a"miracle"in the jungle.
In this once dangerous malaria-
infested area, the jungle has been
cleared by the Government, the
ancient irrigation system based on
copious"tanks"which are the size
of small lakes has been restored, and
colonists, formerly displaced persons,
have been settled on the land.
Thanks to the irrigation, good
crops are now being produced, small
and attractive houses have been built
on the plots of land assigned to the
different families, and, in general,
the economic status of the people
has been raised.
But a better economic status does
not always mean a better life. The
colonists still need education and
the Centre's extension staff will
therefore organize a special teaching
programme for them, while continu-
ing their work among villages as
yet"unreclaimed".
While showing people of all castes,
creeds and circumstances how they
can improve their living conditions,
the Centre at Minneriya will also be
working out and demonstrating prac-
tical ways of self-help that can be
usefully followed by the peoples of
other countries.
The Ceylon project is also provid-
ing a significant demonstration of
co-operation and co-ordination, the
Centre being staffed by experts In
literacy training, agricultural educa-
tion, sanitation, rural industries and
home economics in co-operation with
Unesco and three other UN Spe-
cialized Agencies-the World
Health Organization, the Interna-
tional Labour Organization and the
Food and Agricultural Organization.
Representatives of different related
departments of the Ceylon Govern-
ment will also join the staff. All
the bodies as well as voluntary non-
official agencies will work together
in a common programme.
The Ceylon Centre will also be
co-ordinated with the new Unesco
Pilot-Project in Delhi State, India,
and with any other Unesco Funda-
mental Education Projects which are
being or are to be established in the
countries of South and South East
Asia.

### 73552: To harness its resources India sets up first Asian T.V.A.

To Harness Its Resources
INDIA SETS UP FIRST ASIAN T. V. A.
by Tibor Mende, Author of "L'Inde devant l'orage"
One of the many dams under construction in India today-part of the vast schemes
undertaken by the Government to harness natural resources in order to raise
India out of poverty. and provide her people with a higher standard of living.
Work proceeds on Damodar power project. Sand is received through a rope-way
from the Damodar river-bed and blown into mine-shafts and tunnels in sand-stowing
collier, Above. Schemes like D. V. C. will alleviate India's serious food shortage.
THE Damodar is a wandering and capricious river in the North East
of India. It rises in the hills of Chota Nagpur, assumes the dignity
of a great river before it reaches Bengal and then joins the Hooghly
not far below Calcutta. Though modest in size it is a giant in destruction.
Like most of India's rivers it is given to extremes. With the rains it
overflows its banks, destroys crops and dwellings, carries away men and
cattle, disrupts communications and gravely damages the economy of
the entire region. In the dry season, it dwindles to almost a trickle and
slowly winds its way across a desolate country of arid fields.
But the valley of the Damodar,
cutting across Bihar and Bengal, is
India's richest mineral basin and its
soil is potentially fertile. In this area
millions of idle men wait to be usefully
employed. If only the"River of
Sorrows"-as the Damodar is called
in West Bengal-could be made to
serve them... it might drive turbines
and generate electricity ; it could be
channelled to irrigate land and carry
barges on canals. It might help to
exploit the region's resources, to work
factories, to modernize agriculture and
to change the Valley of Destruction
into one of hope and progress.
This is precisely what India's
planners want the Damodar to do. To
tame the river they have borrowed
their methods from the United States
Tennessee Valley Authority. India's
answer to the Damodar's extravagance
is a smaller T. V. A. which will put the
river to work. The idea of the
Damodar Valley Corporation (D. V. C.)
goes back to the 1943 floods. The
disastrous inundation of that year
caused enormous damage and called
for urgent action. It led to the
planning of India's first multi-purpose
river-scheme.
7 Million People to Benefit
THE D. V. C. was first conceived asa 10-year project calling for the
building of eight dams with
hydro-electric stations at each, a
200, 000 kilowatt steam-power station,
an irrigation barrage with 1, 553 miles
of distribution canals and a 90 mile-
long navigation canal. The cost of
this project-about 115 million dollars
- was found to be beyond the means
of the young Republic and conse-
quently revised. According to the new
schedule, the first phase of the scheme
will be realized within five years and
the remainder in slower successive
stages. This first phase will include
only four of the originally planned
eight dams together with the barrage
and irrigation systems. Thanks to a
World Bank loan of $18, 500, 000 pro-
vided in April 1950, work on the D. V. C.
project is progressing at an accelerated
rate.
Already, Bihar's countryside is
changed by the walls and chimneys
which are rising, by the workers'huts
and the army of men employed on the
large-scale enterprise. When comple-
ted the D. V. C. scheme will provide
irrigation for 750, 000 acres and will
generate about 350, 000 kilowatts of
electricity. Besides its basic objects
the project has several other attractive
features. It will provide a navigation
canal which will connect the famous
Raniganj coalfields with the port of
Calcutta and thus relieve congestion
in India's overburdened raiJways. As
a by-product D. V. C. will provide faci-
lities to combat effectively malaria, a
disease that claims millions of victims
in India each year. The benefits of
D. V. C. will directly affect the lives of
five million people in the valley and
another two million town-dwellers. It
had been calculated that the direct
benefits of the scheme, translated into
terms of current prices, would add

about $50 millions to India's yearly
national income. The indirect bene-
fits, human and material, though not
easy to calculate, would probably be
even bigger.
First of a Whole Series
SOME of the component parts ofthe D. V. C. are alr ady taking
shape. Considerable progress has
been made in setting up a power-
plant of 150, 000 kilowatts at Bokaro.
The Konar dam will be finished in
1952 and the operations on the Tilaiya
dam are also in progress and may be
completed by the middle of 1951. Pre-
liminary work on two more of the
projected eight dams-at Maithon
and Pench-Hill - is
When the monsoon fails, starvation
starts. That has been the sad history
of India for centuries. In present-day
India about 242 million acres of land
are under cultivation. Of these not
more than 20 per cent-about 47 mil-
lion acres-are being irrigated. Yet
waterways form India's basic wealth
and the promise of her future well-
being. They offer an answer to her
three chief problems : food, health and
rising population.
At present less than six per cent of
India's available water wealth is being
utilized ; the rest is running to waste.
Thus, the amount of electricity
consumed in India annually is just
about equal to that generated in the
United States in a week for less than
half as many people. But even this
low Indian consumption accounts for
only four big cities while some 90 per
cent of the population uses almost
nothing.
A Synonym of Hope
CHEAP power, therefore, is India'sprimary n ed to rais  herself out
of poverty and to enable her to
harness her natural resources. Whether
for domestic purposes or the manu-
facturing of fertilizers, to improve
agriculture or to conserve the
country's meagre coal resources, cheap
power is of supreme importance.
Indirectly, India's river projects
provide a great unifyhg factor, a new
common denominater to cement
together people divided by time-worn
sectional loyalties.
The élan of a joint enterprise as
well as the benefits of those schemes
will be felt across provincial and lan-
guage boundaries. Against the bleak
background of the burnt, bare hills
and the desolate fields, slowly and
painfully emerges the new hope of
. cle3n and healthy villages, of well-
irrigated fields and neatly terraced
hillsides.
With the help of the D. V. C. and
other river projects, India is moving
out of her proverbial immobility. The
enthusiasm that inspires her plans
springs from the claim of one-sixth
of mankind to obtain its overdue
share of human progress.

India's industrial expansion has just begun. This tinplate mill and other industrial projects will need

The Damodar Valley
Corporation however,
is only the first in a
series of impressive
and significant vent-
ures of a similar na-
ture now being carried
out in India. The
sacred rivers of India
are gradually being
harnessed to serve
man and to bring new
hope to a people per-
manently on the
margins or famine.
For nothing has
hampered independent
India's progress more
than her lack of food.
To end her dependence
on costly food imports,
India's agriculture has
to be modernized as
quickly as possible.
This means irrigation
and fertilization. It
means building canals
and providing electric
energy : in other
words tapping India's
water supply.
With few exceptions
the country receives

an average of 45
inches-in the
three summer months.

### 73553: Kalakshetra, temple of beauty

tt * ND what would you call your
mission in life ?" The
Hindu poet, surrounded by
a group of Paris students, showed
mild surprise."The same as all
artists", he replied gravely,"to civi-
lize the barbarians..."Then the poet
explained how in the course of his
travels through Europe and America
and across half the continent of Asia,
he had been dismayed by the expres-
sions of suspicion and anxiety on
men's faces wherever he went. He
had found nothing uplifting in the
books they chose to read nor the
theatres they visited. In fact, their
entertainment sources generally
seemed to represent the worst form
of escapism. Nor were their chil-
dren exempt. Brought up to make
heroes of bandits and fighting men,
their minds quickly became distorted
by fear and hate.
"These millions of savages", eon-
tinued the poet, learn
how to read, count and
write. Some can even
boast that their heads
are crammed with a mass
of knowledge. But to
me, civilization means
something different. It
means the creation of
beauty, but first there
must be the search for
beauty. Beauty must be
understood."He paused,
perhaps to give his next
words more weight."The
best way to civilize this
century, is to begin with
the children. What would
happen, for instance, if
we taught them all to
dance ?"
The following day the
students sought out the
Hindu poet again. He
began by telling them of
a school in Madras called
Kalakshetra,-temple of
beauty, consecrated to art.
The illustration was
apt. At first glance
Kalakshetra seems just
another. school offering
courses in the dance,
music, painting and sculp-
ture. But in actual fact,
Kalakshetra is less inte-
rested in producing pro-
fessionnals and artists than in pro-
ducing men and women whose
lives are rounded and complete,
whose entire personality, mental,
moral and physical, blends into a
harmonious whole.
It was an Indian dancer, Madame
Srimathi R u k m i n i Devi, who
founded Kalakshetra early in Jan-
uary 1936 ; an Indian dancer who
had devoted herself to a form of
the dance (natya) so-called in
honour of the Indian sage who codi-
fied this dance form. Madame Ruk-
mini Devi has explained its signifi-
cance in these terms :.. Bharata natyam simultaneously
educates and disciplines : the phy-
sical body by exercizing all its
members and calling out its vital
energies in its rhythmical breathing ;
the mental faculties from memory
to intelligence in understanding and
carrying out the pattern and order
of the many movements that make
up the rhythmic vocabulary of the
dance ; the emotions in expressing
those of the imagined characters of
the dance story and conveying them
to others, also the aesthetical happi-
ness in creating an expression of
beauty to which each dancer is an
essential contributor ; the aspiration-
OIl impulse, the feeling out towards
a larger and loftier life than that of
the senses and circumstances."
These words became the"credo"
of the school of Kalakshetra. Ma-
degrees, in every child, will uncons-
ciously solve most of the problems
that divert and delay humanity on
the way to progress."Therefore ; in
the different courses of instruction
open to the children at Kalakshetra
as much time and importance is
devoted to the arts as is given to
textbook and scientific training in
other schools. Yet though Kalak-
shetra calls on all the arts to play
their role in education and in the

spirit". Ram Gopa ! (above) is today considered one of the masters of the I ndian classical ballet.
dame Rukmini Devi sought to show
the underlying harmony uniting all
the arts ; their vital importance to
progress in its many individual,
national, religious and international
forms ; and at the same time, how
the dance could serve the cause of
peace through an understanding of
the art and culture of all peoples.
Kalakshetra soon became known as
'a conservatoire, an international
cultural centre and a school where
more than 600 children were educa-
ted by the most modern methods.
Highly esteemed by her own
countrymen, the founder of Kalak-
shetra has won the recognition of
educators throughout the world.
Madame Maria Montessori travelled
half-way around the globe to meet
her and for many years collaborated
with the Indian dancer in her work
at Madras.
Emotion, Truth, Beauty
t-y ALAKSHETRA's primary aim is to
"'-help every pupil give fullexpression to his artistic and
creative ability."It is my convic-
tion", says Madame Rukmini Devi,
"that the complete development of
the skill and judgment and taste
that are latent, though in varying
re-education of the emotions, great-
est emphasis is nonetheless placed
on music and dancing.
Many Western teachers too would
like to give more prominence to
dancing in their educational pro-
grammes. It is unfortunate, there-
fore, that folk dancing, figure dances
and the modern rhythmics lack the
powerful historical and religious
force of Bharata natyam with its
wealth of tradition dating back two
and three thousand years.
The gestures, rhythms and pos-
tures used in the Indian dance and
mime have their fixed symbolic
values which blend harmoniously
one into the other. The hands
alone employ a whole vocabulary of
signs (mudras) capable of expressing
or evoking the most imaginative
stories. Nowhere is this more fully
shown than in the sacrificial dance
where every type of rhythmic
expression is conveyed, from the
lift of an eyebrow to a curve of the
fingertips, from a twist of the neck
and shotilders to the smallest move-
ments of the feet. The purpose of
the dance at all times is to stir the
emotions, and if it is an"expres-
sion''dance, also to reveal sat yam,
shivam, sundaram-that is to say,
the true, the beautiful, and the good.
role. It is a pity that
Indian. music, with its
wide range of tone modul-
ations, is so little known
outside Asia. Purely me-.
lodic, this music is based
on natural intervals, each
octave being normally
divided into twenty-two
unequal intervals. A cer-
tain number of specially
chosen intervals form a
melodic phrase or raga,
of about seven notes.
Each melodic phrase
corresponds to a particu-
lar emotional mood or
impulse, or to a certain
time or season. There
are seven ragas for the
morning, and six for the
evening. If one adds to
this wealth of melodic
expression, the vast com-
plexity of different
rhythms, the possibilities
of this musical language
become inexhaustible.
Not only can it satisfy the
most finely attuned ear,
but also the listener's
desire for spiritual solace
as well.
There are undoubtedly
other musical systems-
particularly in the west-
ern world-which could
play as important a role in edu-
cation as the classical Indian
music of Kalakshetra. Drama and
the plastic arts, if not the dance,
could certainly be used to this end.
But as a first step, we must recognize
- as Madame Rukmini Devi has
done, and, before her time, the
ancient scholars of India and
China, Plato and Montaigne-that,
without the arts, there can be no
education in the true sense of the
word.
Admitting this, we can sympathize
with the mission of our poet among
the'barbarians'and understand the
work of the Indian dancer at Kalak-
shetra who recently summed up her
philosophy of the dance with this
sentence :"To bring the young to
appreciate beauty and therefore to
live it,"she has written,"is one of
our greatest tasks. With the rebirth
of culture will be born not only
great masterpieces of art for future
generations to admire, but master-
pieces of character, the birth into
the present day of great geniuses
who alone can lift the world from
the uncivilized to the civilized and
so will help the whole race to a
standard of life which, even at its
worst, can never be ugly, vulgar or
cruel.".
A people capable of creating and
maintaining such deep symbolic
values in the dance, were clearly
destined to make full use of
it as an educational medium as well.
For according to Hinduism, it was
the Shiva dance which created the
world and re-creates it from mo-
ment to moment.
Music, whose mysterious power is
increasingly recognized by psychi-
atrists, plays an equally important
