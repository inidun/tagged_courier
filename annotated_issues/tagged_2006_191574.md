The first years of children’s lives strongly influence their future and particularly 
their performance in school. numerous studies show 
that investing in early childhood care and education pays off,  
notably in the poorer countries. nonetheless, 
efforts made to meet early childhood care needs are generally insufficient. 3

in Early Childhood Care and Education. The Roving Caregivers 
Programme is concentrating on reaching kids who are under 
three and from the most disadvantaged and rural areas. 4

I gram. They were then evaluated once 
a year until age 11, then several more 
times in the course of their later lives. 
The results showed that they were 
more successful than the rest, as 65% 
of them finished high school, versus 
only 45% of those who did not partici-
pate in the programme. They also re-
ported higher earnings (60% of them 
make more than US$20,000 annually, 
versus 40% in the other group). “Gen-
erally speaking, there is a very high re-
turn on investment. This is an important 
fact for poor countries to take into con-
sideration,” comments Nick Burnett, 
Director of the EFA Global Monitoring 
Report, whose 2007 edition coming 
out on 26 October focuses on early 
childhood education. Investing in early 
childhood is thus a key to reducing 
poverty.
Yet early childhood – meaning the 
period from birth until primary school 
age – is still treated as the poor relative 
in education. In almost half the coun-
tries in the world, no formal structure 
t appears a priori that all conditions 
have been met for early childhood care 
and education to be the focus of atten-
tion from all sides. First, the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child, with its 
near universal adoption, has helped 
to shape early childhood policies. It’s 
also the first goal of Education for All, 
taken on by the international commu-
nity as an outcome of the 2000 World 
Education Forum in Dakar. We know, 
furthermore, that children’s early years 
determine their future, notably their 
performance at school, as numerous 
studies have shown. 
The best-known study on the subject 
is the High/Scope Perry Preschool 
programme, conducted in the United 
States between 1962 and 1967 and 
followed up at regular intervals since. 
The study examines the lives of 123 
African Americans attending the pre-
school in Ypsilanti (Michigan), born 
in poverty and at high risk of failing in 
school. At ages 3 and 4, the subjects 
received a high-quality preschool pro-

exists for early childhood education, 
and public spending in many cases 
remains paltry. 
Poor relative
What donors give for early child-
hood education represents on the 
average 10% of what they give for pri-
mary school. Differences are marked 
among regions: prevalent in industrial-
ized countries, pre-primary schooling 
reaches 62% in Latin America and 
the Caribbean, far ahead of South and 
West Asia (32%), the Arab States 
(16%) or Sub-Saharan Africa (12%). 
(Source: 2007 EFA Global Monitoring 
Report) 
These figures require further interpre-
tation, because one characteristic of 
early childhood education is not rely-
ing entirely on educational institutions. 
“Contrary to what happens in the pri-
mary and secondary sectors, it involves 
actors in the informal system, such as 
families and communities,” explains 
Hye-Jin Park of the UNESCO Basic 
Elementary school at Sampubangin village, Markham Valley.

Education Division. While in Europe 
we consider that the state has a legiti-
mate role, this is not the case in other 
regions. Some countries consider 
early childhood to be entirely the re-
sponsibility of private initiative. “There is 
no general consensus on what domain 
is the state’s and what is the family’s,” 
says Burnett.
Learning 
to live in society
“In fact, it’s not easy to define what is 
good for children,” adds Anne-Marie 
Chartier, teacher and researcher on 
the history of education in Paris. A 
recent example: the debate in France 
between teachers and child psychia-
trists on whether children should start 
school at two years old. The issue is 
all the more controversial because 
early childhood education concerns 
not only education, but also nutrition, 
health and cognitive development. 
“What you learn at that age,” says 
Pepa Del Val, teacher at Our Lady 
Of Wisdom School in Madrid, “is of 
course to hold a pencil, but it’s more 
about sharing and respecting others 
– becoming little people who can live 
in a society.” 
Over time, early childhood care and 
education is making progress almost 
everywhere in the world: preschool 
attendance has tripled since 1970. 
“More and more women want to 
work. This trend, along with the de-
cline of the traditional role of the fam-
ily, increases the demand,” explains 
Burnett. Nonetheless, the children 
who stand to benefit from early lear-
ing opportunities are those most 
likely to be excluded. Good quality 
programmes have the potential to 
advance children’s rights and make a 
dent into staggering figures of depriva-
tion: even today 10.5 million children 
in the world die of avoidable diseases 
before the age of five.

### 193863: Jamaica: a smile makes it worthwile

“Playing is  
the foundation of learning,” 
says Melonie Chambers, 
a “Rover” with the Jamaican 
Roving Caregivers Programme.

them to use common courtesies 
like “thank you” and “sorry”. The 
children’s laughter and cheers ring 
through the air. 
“For now, the ring game is a way to 
use up the children’s energy. When 
they are older they will be able to 
participate even more” Melonie ex-
plains to the parents. “Playing is the 
foundation of learning,” she adds. 
Melonie is a “Rover” with the 
Jamaican Roving Caregivers 
Programme (RCP), a community-
based early childhood development 
programme administered by an 
NGO called the Rural Family 
Support Organization (RuFamSo). 
After playing in the sun, it is time 
to go on the veranda of the wooden 
structure. Melonie and the children 
sing a song as they wash the dirt off 
of their hands. “We tried to teach 
the children and their parents about 
proper hygiene,” whispers a Rovers’ 
project officer who has come to the 
field to observe Melonie today.
Giving back  
to the community
Early Childhood Care and Educa-
tion has a long-standing tradition 
in Jamaica, with 95% participation 
rates for four- and five-year-olds and 
around 60% for three-year-olds.
Rovers like Melonie, are caregiv-
ers who come from the poor, rural 
communities that they serve. The 
name “Rover” stems from the fact 
that they travel from home to home. 
Each Rover is responsible for ap-
proximately thirty families, who are 
visited for 30 to 45 minutes several 
times per week. 
Early Childhood Care and Educa-
tion has a long-standing tradition 
in Jamaica, with 95% participation 
rates for four- and five-year-olds and 
around 60% for three-year-olds. 
National efforts are now focusing 
on better access for children under 
three and those from the poorest 
families and most disadvantaged 
and rural areas. 
RCP fits within Jamaica’s priori-
ties. It focuses on improving the de-
velopment, health and nutrition of 
children aged 0-3, promoting their 
parents’ self-esteem and child-rear-
ing knowledge, and assisting with 
income-generating activities for the 
community. All told, 14,255 parents 
and 22,335 children in three rural 
parishes have been served since 
the programme began in 1992. 
Melonie has been working in this 
particular community for a few 
months now and says that the 
growth that she has noticed in 
both parents and children is worth 
the over 50 miles she travels daily 
for her sessions. “The parents and 
children are so good, energetic and 
enthused,” she says. “I love being 
around the children, doing this kind 
of work is my passion.” 
The lessons the parents learn are 
far-reaching. “Rovers go into the 
homes to work with infants and par-
ents, but there is a ripple effect to 
other children,” says Utealia Burrell, 
Director of the programme.
It’s worth 
the challenges
It is not only the children and fami-
lies who benefit, but the Rovers as 
well. While Rovers are all secondary 
school graduates, many were previ-
ously unemployed. To prepare for 
their role, they receive regular train-
ing and are periodically supervised 
in the field by project officers. They 
are not only paid for their work, but 
it also often leads to further educa-
tion and even professional certifica-
tion. Melonie is currently training 
in Early Childhood Education at 
HEART NTA, a national vocational 
institution. “We even have some 
parents who—once they success-
fully complete the programme—go 
on to become Rovers themselves,” 
says Burrell. “Having been in the 
programme, they understand the 
experiences of parents in the com-
munity.” 
Evaluations carried out by UNI-
CEF and the Bernard van Leer 
Foundation demonstrate that RCP 
is a good investment. The pro-
gram has now been successfully 
replicated in four other Caribbean 
countries: Dominica, Grenada, 
St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the 
Grenadines. Burrell has recently 
presented the programme in Africa 
and hopes that it can be replicated 
there too. 
The Jamaica Roving Caregivers 
Programme is not without its share 
of challenges. “Some parents were 
sceptical at first, saying that the 
child is too young to learn,” explains 
Melonie. “However, after about 
three months with the programme 
these parents said their child was 
responding to their voices, and 
some could identify shapes.” 
Jasanth Bell, 41, a new mother in 
the programme, echoes Melonie’s 
enthusiasm. “I enjoy being with pro-
gramme. You learn to treat the chil-
dren with respect and lots of love…
how to tell the children mommy 
loves you,” she smiles. She contin-
ues, “The baby is 5 months now, so 
I have a long way to go.” 
“Seeing the positive impact you 
have on a child’s life makes the dis-
tance I travel shorter,” Melonie says. 
“I look forward to coming to work, 
I don’t mind the sun…just their 
smiles make it worthwhile.”»

### 193864: Daycare in Colombia

Daycare 
in colombia
             Two years ago, Luz marina mahecha started a new job at home: 
                   she looks after children while their mothers are at work. 
                       in Colombia, more than 80,000 community mothers like Luz 
               provide this kind of children’s daycare service.
Dawn, just breaking over the moun-
tains south of Bogota, illuminates 
the Ciudad Bolivar community. Luz 
Marina is already up. She has to 
take care of 13 children, but they are 
not her own. They are the children 
of her neighbours in the Caracoli 
district, left with her so their moth-
ers can go to work. In Caracoli, only 
one out of three adults has a legal 
job and the number of inhabitants 
is growing daily, due to the influx of 
displaced populations fleeing the 
rural areas, their paramilitary groups 
and guerrilla warfare. 
Luz Marina hasn’t turned forty 
yet. She decided two years ago to 
give up her dressmaker and shop 
assistant activities and devote her-
self entirely to the role of “commu-
nity mother”. When she did, she 
became part of a project initiated 
20 years ago by the Colombian 
Institute of Family Welfare, which 
organizes daycare for more than a 
million children. It keeps them off 
the streets and offers them an al-
ternative to staying at home alone 
while their parents are out. 
Some 5000 community mothers, 
like Luz Marina, provide this kind of 
daycare in the Colombian capital; 
throughout the country they num-
ber nearly 82,000. A study of ado-
lescents between the ages of 13 
and 17, conducted in Colombia by 
the 2007 Education for All Global 
Monitoring Report, revealed that 
children who benefit from such day-
care are more likely to be in school 
and less likely to repeat a year.
A new job, 
a new way of life
“When I got an offer to work with 
the Institute of Family Welfare, I 
immediately accepted. But I had 
to adapt my life and my house to 
the new situation,” says the young 
woman, her round cheeks ruddy 
from Bogota’s chilly mountain air. 
At the time, Luz Marina and her hus-
band, a construction worker, lived 
in a house built of brick and corru-
gated metal. They had to transform 
the living and dining rooms into a 
kindergarten. They painted the 
walls of the two rooms, the only co-
loured ones in the house. They also 
added red colouring to cement, to 
make surfaces look like terracotta. 
A sign hangs outside, on which is 
written the name of the daycare 
centre: “My little friends”. 
Taking care of children has given 
Luz Marina steady employment, and 
in her own home. She is spared a 
daily commute of two hours on the 
bus to get to work. Furthermore, 
she receives a stipend of 185,000 
pesos ($77) per month, on top of 
the parents’ fees, ranging from 
$3 to $5. The Institute also gives 
her a certain sum to buy food and 
supplies.

### 193864: Daycare in Colombia

“At the end of the day, I’m exhaust-
ed. It’s not easy looking after chil-
dren of different ages. The smallest 
one, Sharon, walks, goes to the toi-
let by herself, and talks…a lot,” ex-
plains Luz Marina with a smile. 
More 
than babysitting
“By the grace of God, I’ve become 
another person from being in con-
tact with these children. I’m not 
simply babysitting for a neighbour’s 
child - they’re like my children now. 
I play with them, they make me 
laugh, they tell me what’s going on 
at home, with their families….They 
teach us so much if we make the ef-
fort to listen to them.” 
A typical day: the children arrive, 
wash their hands and eat some “bien-
estarina”, a powder the government 
distributes to prevent malnutrition, 
containing milk and other nourish-
ing ingredients. At about 9.30 a.m., 
activities begin. “We sing, we play 
and we do exercises. At about 11, 
we go have lunch.” Then, after a little 
nap, more activities, either outside 
in the garden if the weather is nice 
or inside if it’s raining. “Occasionally 
we watch some television, usually 
educational programmes for kids.” 
And every so often a priest comes 
to visit the children and teach them 
catechism. 
Even getting up at dawn does not 
faze Luz Marina: “I would like these 
little ones to learn professional skills. 
One day, later, I would like them to 
remember me as someone who did 
something for them - as some kind 
of teacher.”
Henry Orrego, 
in Bogota.

### 193865: Jordan: fathers included

                       for the past ten years, a project has been helping parents in Jordan’s rural 
               and underprivileged regions. until now it focused mainly on mothers, 
                            but fathers have begun to participate, brought in by way of religion.
JorDan
Fathers inCluded
ight o’clock in the morning. Sami-
ra Darwish is getting ready for her 
weekly get-together with neighbour-
hood women. We are in Abu Dhar Al 
Ghafaari, in the Palestinian refugee 
camp of Marka, north of the Jordanian 
capital. Like many other camps that 
materialized because refugees were 
flooding into the country in 1948 and 
1967, Marka at the beginning was 
simply a collection of canvas tents 
donated by the United Nations. As 
time passed, tents were replaced 
by rough shacks, piled one against 
the other. Comfort is rudimentary at 
best. Unemployment, poverty and 
overpopulation have prevailed in the 
camps for as long as three genera-
tions. 
Smira grew up in the neighbour-
hood. That is why she is accepted 
easily, despite her young age. At the 
development centre’s headquarters 
in Abu Dhar Al Ghafaari, a dozen 
women are sitting around the table. 
The topic of the day: the custom, 
which is still popular in the camp, of 
coating babies’ skin with salt to make 
them more robust. The heat is op-
pressive, but Samira’s smile never 
wavers. She explains that not only is 
the practice useless for increasing a 
baby’s vitality, it can even cause de-
hydration. A little later, she advises 
mothers never to use tap water, 
which in the camp is not fit for drink-
ing, to cool off their baby bottles.
Glaring disparities
Samira is a trainer for the Bet-
ter Parenting Initiative, launched by 
UNICEF in 1996 with the support of 
several Jordanian ministries (health, 
education, social development and 
religious affairs), the UNRWA (United 
Nations Relief and Works Agency) 
A global strategy for early 
childhood development
Jordan’s strategy includes 
legislation pertaining to the 
health of pregnant women and 
children, the role of the family 
and the quality of daycare 
centres. The goal is to pay 
more attention to children 
by creating kindergartens in 
remote or less privileged areas 
and providing daily meals and 
warm clothing to children who 
need them. The project aims 
to raise the number of four-
year-old children in school from 
28% to 35% by 2008, 
and to 50% by 2013.

for Palestine refugees, and the Noor 
al Hussein Foundation. Based on 
the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, the project encourages fami-
lies in rural or underprivileged areas 
to acquire sound parenting skills from 
pregnancy on through early child-
hood. Recent studies in the country 
have indeed revealed glaring dispari-
ties in the care given to children under 
the age of three. In ten years, nearly 
45,000 parents have benefited from 
the project and 1500 professionals 
have been trained.
Fathers too
Several times a week, at meetings 
like the ones organized by Samira, 
the group discusses such topics as 
weaning, the importance of communi-
cating with children, or ways to identi-
fy possible developmental problems. 
Sessions are led by professionals – 
teachers, doctors, social workers or 
nurses – who receive training. 
At the beginning, the project fo-
cused almost entirely on mothers. 
No more. Now 37% of the trainers 
are men, with 63% women. The only 
difference is that men get involved 
through their religious practice. The 
men’s sessions are held in certain 
mosques following Friday prayers, 
with the imam’s blessing. 
“The number of male trainers is 
slowly growing,” observes Suzanne 
Salihi, deputy chief of the Better Par-
enting Initiative in UNICEF’s Amman 
office. She stresses the importance 
and impact of the training that takes 
place in the mosques. The project 
has produced a handbook about 
early childhood development for 
imams, and already 30 imams are 
participating. It’s a first step. “It still 
remains much more difficult to make 
contact with the men than with the 
women” adds Suzanne. “You have 
to push aside certain taboos, explain 
that playing with the child is not just 
for mothers, and changing a baby’s 
nappies is not degrading. This is not 
always self-evident.” 
Yet the effort seems to be pay-
ing off. Samy, a trainer in the Marka 
camp, sees concrete results: “Some 
of the people who trained with me 
have changed their attitude towards 
their children.

                              for the last 20 years, in certain districts of ireland’s capital, 
the Community mothers Programme has been working with women who have just given birth 
                                 to their first child. The innovation: experienced local mothers 
                                             are the ones giving guidance to the beginners.

mothers talking to mothers
INot long ago, the district of Ballymun 
was just a series of dingy gray build-
ings bristling with television aerials, 
their stairwells splattered with graffiti. 
Unemployment and drugs were en-
demic. In the last few years, however, 
the impact of the “Celtic Tiger” eco-
nomic boom has transformed even 
this working-class area, located some 
five kilometers from downtown Dub-
lin. Little by little, the blocks of build-
ings were torn down and their occu-
pants moved into cozy little houses. 
Even a luxury hotel has materialized 
and others are in construction. An 
unthinkable possibility eight years 
ago, when the Community Mothers 
Programme (CMP) implanted itself in 
the area. 
Launched at the beginning of the 
1980s, the CMP helps mothers who 
are giving birth to their first child to 
get off to a good start. It operates 
mainly in the less privileged parts of 
the city. The Programme is offered 
to all first-time mothers; choosing to 
participate or not is up to them. But in 
neighbourhoods like Ballymun, nearly 
80% sign up. In 2005, more than 
50% of the women enrolled in the 
Programme were single mothers and 
close to 10% were teenagers.
Discussions 
over coffee
Similar programmes exist, notably in 
the United Kingdom. What makes the 
CMP different is that it is run not by 
social workers or nurses but by moth-
ers from the community, selected and 
trained by the Programme. They are 
volunteers, receiving only a small sti-
pend to cover transportation. Once 
a month, over a period of two years, 
they visit the families. Casually, over 
a cup of coffee, they chat with the 
child’s mother about the little one’s 
progress or possible difficulties. “It’s 
working because it has one foot in 
formal education system and the 
other in non formal learning. The idea 
is for the parents to feel, at the end, 
like experts on their own children,” 
says Brenda Molloy, head of the 
Programme. Not putting health work-
ers on the front line helps greatly in 
winning the trust of the young mothers. 
“The get-togethers are very informal. 
You feel very comfortable talking,” 
says Antoinette, mother of 4-month-
old Tadhg. 
Jean, 38, is lively, chatty and burst-
ing with energy. She took advantage 
of the Programme when her first child 
was born, 12 years ago. Now she has 
become one of the visiting mothers in

Ballymun. “We’re not there to impose 
anything on the mothers, we’re there 
to answer any questions they might 
have,” she explains. “For instance, is it 
normal that my child does this, or that 
he isn’t like that? We rely on our ex-
perience and common sense. And if 
there’s something we don’t know, we 
ask one of the Programme nurses.”
Measurable results
Another resource for visiting moth-
ers is the documentation provided 
by the health services. With the 
help of diagrams, it explains why it 
is a good idea to speak lovingly to 
your baby, hold him in your arms, 
get him his vaccinations, and not 
give him too many sweets. “Really, 
these are things that seem obvious, 
but they’re not necessarily obvious 
if they weren’t passed on to you. 
I didn’t know, for instance, that it 
was so important to read stories to 
your children,” confides Siobhan, 
another Programme graduate who 
has now become one of the visiting 
mothers in Ballymun. As soon as a 
child is nine months old, therefore, 
mothers are encouraged to join the 
nearest library. 
The CMP employs a dozen nurs-
es and works with nearly 1200 
mothers with an annual budget of 
800,000 Euros. The results are 
already measurable. In 1990, the 
Bernard van Leer Foundation con-
ducted a study with 232 women 
who were first-time mothers. Of 
those who had been involved in 
the Programme, 98% read stories 
to their children, versus only 54% 
of the others. Seven years later, a 
follow-up study with one third of the 
same women revealed that 50% 
of the Programme graduates were 
against slapping as an education-
al method, versus less than 25% 
among the others. “CMP” mothers 
are also more likely to supervise 
their child’s homework, limit time 
spent in front of the television, serve 
varied meals and take their children 
to the dentist. “It doesn’t seem like 
very much,” emphasizes Brenda 
Molloy, “but those few hours spent 
with the mothers can make all the 
difference.”

### 193867: Playing under the fig trees in Kenya

“L
                                      young children in a rural kenyan community thrive 
                               thanks to “Loipi” community learning centres 
                                         that are culturally adapted to their needs.
Playing unDer the fig trees 
in Kenya
  oipi” means shade in the lan-
guage of the Samburu, traditional 
pastoralists who live in northern 
Kenya. In this hot, arid land, the 
precious area under the shade of 
trees plays an important role in 
people’s lives. Samburu men make 
community decisions in the shade 
of a tree specifically designated 
as the site of the council. And 
grandmothers, the time-honoured 
caregivers of Samburu children, 
traditionally feed the community’s 
cherished youngest members, 
teach them songs and tell them 
folk tales in a shady space under 
a large tree. 
Appropriately, the word associ-
ated with shade and gathering in 
Samburu now also refers to a cul-
turally-friendly educational initiative 
that ensures children are prepared 
for formal schooling. As partici-
pants in the Loipi Project, part of 
Kenya’s nationwide Early Child-
hood Care and Education pro-
gramme (see box), Samburu chil-
dren spend their days in communal 
enclosures called Loipi, playing 
and learning under fig trees with 
other children their age. 
“They grow up socializing in-
stead of in isolation,” says Mariam 
Lapukuyum, mother of six children. 
“We cannot assure a school edu-
cation in the city (Nairobi), but at 
the centres they are given a good 
foundation about life and every-
thing they may do when they grow 
up.” Adds another mother, Wilkis-
ter Murairu, “They are being taught 
things we never had the opportu-
nity to learn.”
There at least 85 Loipi in the 
sprawling Samburu district, and 
children from different communi-
ties gather at the closest one. In 
keeping with the project’s non-
intrusive approach and emphasis 
on tapping community resources, 
most materials used in the Loipi 
are locally made and produced 
and caregivers include mothers, 
grandmothers and other commu-
nity members. The programme is 
designed for children up to the 
“We cannot assure a school 
education in the city (Nairobi), 
but at the centres they are 
given a good foundation about 
life and everything they may do 
when they grow up,” 
says Mariam Lapukuyum, 
mother of six children.

age of four, after which they are 
encouraged to enroll in pre-school, 
if there is one. If not, activities for 
older children are incorporated 
into the Loipi. 
At one Loipi near the district 
headquarters of Maralal, about 
280 kilometres (175 miles) north 
of the capital, children listen to sto-
ries about humanity’s origins. They 
learn to wash their hands before 
eating. They sing, guess riddles 
and play football with cheap plas-
tic balls. Lessons are given using 
familiar objects - balls, pebbles, 
bottle tops and sticks. As one 
trainer explains, “At this stage, it’s 
rather complicated to use books. 
We teach using what the children 
like playing with. Unlike children 
raised in urban areas, they have no 
access to modern toys or Disney 
cartoons.” 
Games and other activities blend 
modern techniques to stimulate 
learning with traditional child-rear-
ing practices. “We let the children 
play, rest or sleep,” says Maria 
Kibasia, a centre volunteer. Adds 
instructor Martin Olanga with a 
smile, “We let them cry. We give 
them the freedom to understand 
life from a very young age.” Olanga 
was trained in government-spon-
sored early-childhood education 
seminars, during which, he says, 
teachers learn how to motivate a 
child’s “delicate mind”: “You let it 
do what it wants, but in a guided 
and safe way.” 
The Loipi children also receive 
other benefits, such as basic medi-
cal treatment and immunizations. 
On those days, parents are en-
couraged to come in with their chil-
dren to learn about health, hygiene 
and development. “For example, if 
a child needs to take medicine out-
side centre-hours, you must work 
with the parents,” says Kibasia. 
“Parents are becoming increas-
ingly cooperative, especially about 
the children’s health. This is en-
couraging.”
Improving chances 
for a brighter future
The results of the Loipi project are 
encouraging in many respects. First 
and foremost, “It helps children 
develop communication skills, im-
prove their social skills and develop 
physically,” said Gilbert Momanyi, a 
sociology lecturer at the University 
of Nairobi. In addition, the kids also 
learn about clean water, food secu-
rity, hygiene and communal values. 
These integrated interventions ben-
efit an estimated 27,000 children 
and their families in Samburu dis-
trict, according to a recent study 
entitled “Influencing and Develop-
ing Good Policy in Early Childhood 
Development (ECD) among Pasto-
ralist Communities in East Africa.” 
As a result, though they belong to 
one of the poorest communities 
in Kenya, 54 percent of Samburu 
children are enrolled in pre-school 
compared to a national average of 
45 percent. 
Rooted in the community, the Loipi 
project also empowers it, as centres 
become focal points for nutrition, 
health and wider community educa-
tion. Joseph Mwaura, a local admin-
istrator, describes how the centres 
create links to helpful NGOs, main-
tain children’s medical records and 
have gained government approval 
and support. The education minis-
try helps with educational materials 
and teachers; the health ministry 
supplies vaccines and medicines. 
And no wonder, says a Kenyan ed-
ucation ministry official: “Talk about 
killing several birds with one stone. 
Who wouldn’t want to support that 
project, which makes life so much 
easier?” 
The goal now is to extend the 
project to other countries facing 
similar challenges, where tradi-
tional nomadic pastoralist commu-
nities are in transition to sedentary 
settlement. According to Oxfam’s 
2005 statistics, between 25 and 
40 million school-age children in 
the world live in nomadic pastoral-
ist societies, and only 10 to 50% 
attend school. The Loipi model is 
now being implemented in Kenya, 
Tanzania, Uganda, Ethiopia, Nigeria 
and Namibia.

Localizing 
early Childhood 
education
In Kenya, an experimental 
programme for early childhood 
education started in the early 
1970s with teacher training 
and curriculum development. 
the government established 
the project on national level 
in 1983, with support from 
the Dutch bernard van Leer 
Foundation, which specializes 
in early childhood education 
programmes.
In the 1980s the state-run Kenya 
Institute of Education and  
the Christian Children Fund (CCF) 
formed a partnership to improve 
the lifestyle in the Samburu region, 
which sits in the dustbowl of Kenya. 
In 1995, experts came to 
the Samburu district and carried out 
a study on child rearing practices 
among the community called 
“Influencing and Developing Good 
Policy in Early Childhood 
Development (ECD) among 
Pastoralist Communities in East 
Africa.” The main reason for the study, 
experts say, was to revive 
and enhance child rearing practices 
that had been strained by hardship, 
poverty and inter-tribe wars. 
“This led to a completely 
new atmosphere with the parents 
and communities, because the study 
directly involved them and drew on 
their knowledge and experience for 
the first time,” Tanja van de Linde said 
in the study. Now, for example, 
children are taught in their mother 
tongue in the Loipi.

### 193868: A Recipe for success in Papua New Guinea

                         in a country with over 800 different languages, 
           children in Papua new guinea can begin their learning experience 
                             in their mother-tongue.
a reciPe for success 
in PaPua new guinea
arbara Mea teaches in Hanuaba-
da, a village in Port Moresby, capi-
tal of Papua New Guinea (PNG). 
The urban community, not far from 
the modern city centre, is mainly 
indigenous Motuan and its typical 
houses are built on stilts above the 
water. Each day, Barbara walks 
into her preschool level class at 
the Hagara Elementary School to 
be greeted by 35 children speak-
ing to her in Motu. It’s their mother 
tongue, just one – out of over 800 
- of the small island nation’s aston-
ishing array of indigenous languag-
es. And even though English has 
traditionally dominated the PNG 
school system, Barbara teaches all 
her subjects - including language, 
counting, colors and shapes, cul-
ture and community living - in Motu. 
“In the language class,” says 
Barbara, “we teach children to 
read and write in Motu. Through 
the influence of early missionaries, 
we already have translations of the 
Bible and of Methodist hymns, and 
now there are also other books in 
Motu.” To get to know their cul-
ture, her pupils study the unusual 
Motuan calendar, which has 13 
months instead of the Western cal-
endar’s 12. “Children discover that 
in Motuan custom, the month de-
termines the people’s communal 
activities,” she continues. “For ex-
ample, in the early part of the year, 
they plant their gardens. Around 
September, most of the cultural 
activities take place, so we teach 
children about the different types 
of dances performed when people 
are celebrating.” 
The same preschool programme, 
required by the Ministry of 
Education and designed to pro-
vide children with two years of 
basic education in their vernacu-
lar language before they enter pri-
mary school, exists throughout the 
country. Fred Ngansia, a teacher 
in Umbukul, rural village on New 
Hanover Island, New Ireland 
Province, divides his time be-
tween giving his pupils lessons 
in Tungag, the local language 
spoken by about 20,000 peo-
ple, and instructing them in the 
ancestral life-style, including 
protecting the reefs that provide 
the community with fish and other 
marine resources.
A recipe for success
It’s a winning formula. Children 
achieve literacy in their mother 
tongue, explore the ancient tradi-
tions and develop their sense of 
identity. At the same time, experts 
have noted, they make the devel-
opmental, cognitive and academic 
progress necessary to succeed

in school. As Barbara Mea ex-
plains, “When children first arrive 
at school, they often feel lost. 
They’ve picked up the language 
within their own families - the for-
mal setting and structured learning 
are new and unfamiliar. But by their 
third year, when they start primary 
school and begin to learn English, 
the basic skills they’ve acquired en-
able them to grasp it more quickly.” 
Proving her point are children like 
eight-year-old Michael, of mixed 
parentage like thousands of his 
compatriots. His mother Stephanie 
Malun is Motuan, his father comes 
from Pidgin-speaking Manus. 
“Michael has learned Motu and 
Pidgin and is starting English,” tes-
tifies Stephanie. “He can speak all 
three languages quite well.” 
That’s the idea. English is one of 
PNG’s three official languages – 
along with Motu and Pidgin - but 
it’s a first language for only 50,000 
people. With an estimated 823 
languages still spoken by a popula-
tion of some 5.5 million and wide-
spread multilingualism, PNG is the 
country with the greatest linguistic 
diversity in the world. It intends to 
keep that distinction. This is one 
developing country determined to 
preserve its cultural and linguistic 
uniqueness. One significant strate-
gy is including vernacular languag-
es in the formal education system.
Scaling up multilingual 
education nationally
Yet PNG’s bilingual education 
policies are relatively recent. From 
1870 on, the first mission schools 
in PNG used the vernacular lan-
guages, but an English-only policy 
was adopted in the 1950s. Re-
viewed at independence in 1975, 
it was maintained under the 1976 
Education Act. 
Then, in 1979, it wasn’t the gov-
ernment that launched vernacu-
lar preschool education, it was 
a group of parents on Bougain-
ville Island in North Solomons 
Province, out of concern that their 
children were losing their language 
and culture. The community-
based Viles Tok Ples Skul (VTPS) 
(“village language school”) scheme 
was developed, later known as Tok 
Ples Pri Skul (TPPS) (“vernacular 
language preschools”). With lo-
cal funds and the help of NGOs, 
it quickly spread throughout the 
country. Finally, the programme 
was incorporated in the 1995 gov-
ernment Education Reform and is 
now the responsibility of the na-
tional formal education system. 
Having operated non-formally 
for more than 15 years, the pro-
gramme still leaves room for impro-
visation. Fred, for instance, learned 
to teach simply by observing more 
experienced teachers. “The most 
important thing,” he says, “is that 
I grew up in the village and went 
to school here before high school. 
So I know our way of life and our 
language.”
