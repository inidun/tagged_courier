FROM THE UNESCO NEWSROOM...
* ILO : The International Labour Of-
fice (ILO) has just drawn up a job
classification system in which 1, 727
professions and trades have been
defined, codified and compared. The
code shows the corresponding des-
criptions and the qualifications re-
quired for these jobs in ten different
countries, and will thus aid the move-
ment of people who wish to work
abroad.
* INTERNATIONAL : The United
Kingdom has decided to ask for
Parliamentary ratification of the
Unesco-sponsored international agree-
ment which abolishes import duties on
a wide range of educational, scientific
and cultural materials. Iran is also
preparing to obtain Parliamentary
approval.
Thirteen nations-Cambodia. Cey-
lon, Cuba, Egypt, Israel, Laos, Monaco,
Pakistan, Philippines, Sweden, Thai-
land, Vietnam and Yugoslavia-are
already operating this convention.
And 18 additional States have signed,
but not yet ratified it.
The agreement eliminates duties on
books, newspapers, magazines, music
scores, works of art and articles for
the blind. Also exempt are educa-
tional films, filmstrips, newsreels,
sound recordings and scientific equip-
ment if consigned to approved insti-
tutions.
In addition, contracting States un-
dertake to grant import licences and
foreign exchange for publications
reqaired by public libraries.
* U. K. : The astonishing total of more
than 30, 000 letters written by Voltaire
have been gathered by Mr. Theodore
Besterman, British author and biblio-
grapher. They are to be published in
English with annotations by Mr. Bes-
terman. The first three of an eventual
6 volumes will shortly make their
appearance. Thus far, only 18, 000
letters had been made public, accord-
ing to a recent article in the French
daily,"Le Monde". The first collec-
tion of 4, 700 letters was compiled in
1875. Since that time several attempts
have been made to produce a more
complete picture of his correspondence.
* INTERNATIONAL : An agreement
has been signed at Stockholm providing
for exchanges of stadents, teachers
and scientists between Sweden and the
United States of America. The agree-
ment also provides for the financing
of studies, research instruction and
other educational activities of Ameri-
can citizens in Swedish schools and
institutions, while permitting Swedish
citizens to travel to the United States
of America for education in American
institutions. To date the fund for
financing this scheme amounts to
tllO. 000. It is the result of sales of
American war surplus property to
Sweden upon the termination of World
War II, as provided for under the
American Fulbright Act.
*. JAPAN : One hundred-and-eighty
Japanese youngsters are romping hap-
pily through their kindergarten lessons
in a man-made cave near Yokohama.
This unique institution owes its
existence to Mr. Takamasa Mutsa-ura,
a Japanese educator, who believes that
the best way to bring up children is to
keep them in close touch with nature.
With this idea in mind, Mr. Mutsu-
ura, using the most primitive tools,
began excavating the side of a solid
rock hill-a laborious task which tock
over 20 years to accomplish. Today
the Mutsu-ura Kindergarten contains
a nursery, a magic lantern screening
hall, a classroom. a parlour, a dining-
room and a washroom.
* UNICEF : A group of Balinese
dancers on tour in the United States
of America have donated the proceeds
of on night's performance to the
United Nations International Child-
ren's Emergency F' ! Dd (UNICEF), it
is announced by Mr. Maurice Pate,
Executive Director of UNICEF. The
contribution of :) : 3 ; 02) was presented
in <iopreciation of aid given to the
children of Indonesia by UNICEF.
A major portion of this gift will be
allocated to assist the Indonesian
Government's child-care programme
which includes basic maternal and
child-health services, training of
midwives and nurses'aides, and the
control of yaws, a crippling tropical
disease. To date the Indonesian
Government, besides matching UNI-
Cf. F's investment in local programmes,
has contributed and pledged a total of
$312, 00 : > to UNICEF's work with
children in other countries.
* CEYLVN : The first two faculties
of the University of Ceylon have
moved into their new permanent home
at Peradeniya, near the capital at
Kandy. The Peradeniya site is
extraordinarily beautiful, and used to
be the royal gardens of the original
Sinhalese monarchy. The layoat of
the new university there was planned
by the famed British architect Sir
Patrick Abercrombie. Other faculties
are to move to Peradeniya as addi-
tional buildings are completed.
* ISRAEL : The Bible in Israel has
become an important textbook on
geology. Engineers and geologists
lately have been scrutinizing the Bible
for information on copper and iron
deposits, and on the location of phos-
phate and manganese. They have
also found clues and descriptions
locating King Solomon's copper mines.
* UNESCO : A new catalogue has
just been published by Unesco that
surveys the fine collection of recorded
folk music from all over the world
now in the French National Record
Library in Paris. The catalogue is in
both French and English, and is the
fourth in the series of Unesco's
"Archives of Recorded Music". It
contains the titles of only vocal and
instrumental music of authentic
folklore, performed by non-professio-
nal singers or instrumentalists. And
it offers proof of the richness and
variety of the folklore of many peo-
ples on all continents.
* FRANCE : A Tolstoy library which
combines the functions of study centre
and museum has just been opened at
the Institute of Slav Studies in Paris.
The new library possesses manuscripts
and exhibits-portraits, photographs
and drawings-relating to the life
and work of the famous Russian
writer. Its large collection of books
includes the Soviet edition of Tolstoy's
complete works, as well as their
translations in French and other
languages. The opening of the
library has been made possible by a
legacy from Tolstoy's daughter, who
died in Italy last year, and the efforts
of one of the author's greatest friends,
M. Charles Salomon.
* TURKEY : Mrs. Lucia Moholy,
British microfilm expert, has joined a
UNESCO Technical Assistance mis-
PARIS TO HAVE
INTERNATIONAL
YOUTH HOSTEL
The French National Commission
for Unesco has decided to establish
an International Youth Centre in
Paris to help young people from
all over the world to overcome
the obstacles 01 different nationalities,
languages, races and backgrounds.
This decision lollows the adoption 01 a
resolution by the General Conference
01 Unesco, inviting Member States to
encourage establishment 01 I nternation-
al Youth Hostels and Camps in nation-
al capitals and other principal cities.
The Paris Centre will accommodate
French and foreign students at low
rates, and provide them wit. a cultural
centre, and a meeting-place for various
activities. Architectural p ! ans include
dormitory lacilities, recreation rooms, a
a gymnasium, a restaurant and an
administrative building. in the cultural
sphere, the centre will contain a book
and record library, and a large hall to
be used lor theatrical performances,
conferences and lectures.
sian now operating a bibliographicaI
centre in the National Library at
Ankara. This centre is designed to
serve Turkish industry, science and
technology with scientific and tech-
nical data. It is already supplying
such information to two other
UNESCO technical assistance missions
working in Turkey on earthquakes
and water-supply problems.
* HOLLAND : The School for the
Blind at Bussum, Amsterdam, is now
training telephonists on switchboards
on whsch the conventional luminous
signals are replaced by different
musical notes which"guide"the
blind operator to the line that is
being used. Training is rapid, and
the Government has offered bonuses
to Dutch firms which go over to
switchboards operated by the blind.
* BELGIUM : Students and teachers
of Louvain University have inaugurat-
ed a"G.. Iltural and Artistic Centre"to
provide a common meeting-ground
between students and Belgian artists.
The Louvain Centre has been holding
an exhibition of paintings, sculpture,
etchings, ceramics, mosaics, photogra-
phy and music produced by Flemish
and Waloon artists. The artists are
invited to the Centre to give informal
talks and lectures which are followed
by lively discussions.
The Centre's president hopes that
this experience will help"to destroy
that. false complex"which he says
leads many university people to
"criticize without true knowledge or to
accept and merely repeat opinions of
others".
* INTERNATIONAL : The Interna-
tional Labour Organization has
announced that its technical assis-
tance projects now number almost
three hundred. Field missions are
all over the world, and a quarter of
the projects are concerned with
vocational training. In many, the
ILO teams are collaborating closely
with Unesco and other UN Specializ-
ed Agencies. In Thailand, for
example, the ILO is helping on the
vocational training and handicraft
training aspects of Unesco's major
project there-assisting in the
reorganization of the educational
system. In Libya, Unesco and ILO
have jointly established a technicaJ
and clerical training centre. In
Ceylon, and in several Latin American
countries, field missions from the two
organizations aJso are working
together very closely.
* U. S. A. : Cheap, mass-produced
chemicals can almost double the
world's food supply. So explained an
American chemist, Dr. Nestor W.
Flodin, to the American Association
for the Advancement of Science, which
met recently in St. Louis, Missouri.
Derivatives of the petroleum industry
and waste plant matter, he said, could
be added to foods that lack protein.
This would enable them to provide the
maximum of body building elements.
Staples, he said, such as wheat, rice and
corn-on which whole populations
often depend-can (be enriched
synthetically, so as to give a balanced
diet.
* SPAIN : A course of lectures on
literature, art, history and geography,
as well as on the Spanish language
will be provided for students from
abroad by the University of Madrid
from March 1 to May 30. During
their stay in Spain, the students will
have free entry to museums, libraries
and other cultural institutions.
* INDIA : India's President, Rajendra
Prasad, recently opened India's fourth
annual exhibition of international
children's art in New Delhi. Besides
India, thirty-one countries participat-
ed in the exhibit. The one thousand
four hundred paintings and drawings
on display represented the creative
work of children between the ages of
five and sixteen. The best picture in
each age group is to receive an award
by India's Prime Minister, Jawarharlal
Nehru.
* INTERNATIONAL : The Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations has just published its Second
World Food Survey. A sequel to its
1946 Survey, the new volume attempts
to answer such vital questions as :
How much food has the world got ?-
How much is needed ?- What are
the prospects for more food in the
next ten years ? The answers, the
Survey points out, give no ground for
complacency. Per capita food pro-
auction in many regions still remains
below pre-war levels. And, in fact,
the proportion of the world's popula-
tion not eating well enough recently
has grown larger than ever. The
Survey asks for an all-round campaign
to attain high nutritional standards.
And it pleads that agriculture's
precious resources should not be
diverted to other uses, lest the very
future of the world be jeopardized.
* NORWAY : A new People's Theatre,
the biggest yet to be built in Norway
opened recently in Oslo with a reper-
tory including Shakespeare's"The
Merry Wives of Windsor". The idea
of a People's Theatre was conceived
late during the 19th century when
popular demand started the People's
Theatre Movement. Since 1929, when
the People's Theatre Association was
formed, its membership steadily
increased and today 117, 000 Norweg-
ians belong to the Association.
* INTERNATIONAL : Portuguese and
Austrian listeners now hear regular
broadcasts of the music of each others'
countries, thanks to exchanges of
recordings arranged between the
Viennese"Red-White-Red" (The Aus-
trian National Colours) Radio Network
and the Portuguese National Radio ill
Lisbon.
* U. S. : American industrial firms,
developing new forms of patronage for
the arts, recently financed Pittsburgh's
first international contemporary music
festival. The festival committee,
headed by Roy Harris, a leading
American composer, selected the works
of fifty contemporary composers,
'whose names had been suggested by
international authorities. Program-
mes included : Benjamin Britten's
"Serenade","Five Tudor Portraits"by
Vaughan Williams, Bela Bartok's
"Music for Strings, Percussion and
Celesta", Stravinsky's"Symphonies
for Wind Instruments"and William
Schuman's"Symphony for Strings".
In a spirit of community participation,
210 local organizations co-operated
with industry which also made funds
available for the commissioning of
works by such composers as Malipiero,
Poulenc, Villa-Lobos and Delapiccola.

### 70189: The University of Saarbrücken: a bridge linking two great European cultures

FEBRUARY 1953. Page 3
A few miles from the capital of the Saar, in the heart of one of the few tracts of
woodland left in the country, is the University of Saarbrucken.) Its 1, 300 students
hail from 25 countries. Of the total, 980 are from the Saar, 136 from German
and 60 from France. There are also many from countries outside Europe.
THE UNIVERSITY OF SAARBRUCKEN
A BRIDGE LINKING TOO GREAT EUROPEAN CULTURES
KARL (from Saarlouis) andJohann (from Mainz), Fran-
çoise (from Nancy) and Giu-
seppe (from Turin), Peter, Katia,
Fernandez, Ahmed-there is little
formality about introductions in the
dining-hall of the"Mensa"of the
University of Saarbrucken. I find
myself returning a hundred young
smiles, shaking hands all round, and
trying to summon up from a halting
memory a few friendly words in
about half-a-dozen different langua-
ges. Through the open window, the
eye goes out to the near-by forest of
stately firs and silver birches sur-
rounding and hemming in the Uni-
versity on every side. It is difficult
to believe that we are in the Saar,
the little country with an area of
only some 965 square miles (and over
900, 000 inhabitants), wedged in
between France and Germany, and
probably possessing more mines and
blast-furnaces than any area of
similar extent anywhere else in the
world.
In Saarbrücken itself, the sky is
sometimes darkened, even at mid-
day, by the thick dust and smoke in
the air. But the University, about
three and a half miles from the
capital of the Saar, in the heart of
one of the few tracts of woodland
still left in the country, is far enough
removed from that modern forge of
Vulcan. It has been set up in a
disused Wehrmacht barracks, an
enormous, and most uninviting,
quadrilateral of low grey buildings.
Such a metamorphosis is an en-
couraging omen. The University of
Saarbrücken in fact stands for one
of the most inspiring attempts being
made to unify the peoples through
culture in this troubled modern
world, all the more striking on this
eastern frontier of France where
international antagonisms have in
the past bred discord and division.
Its history, its short history to date
- for it has been in existence barely
five years-symbolizes the slow and
painful awakening of the European
spirit among the ruins of the second
world war.
On a wet September morning in
1944, when the first French and
American troops fought their way
into Saarbrucken. to the crack of
bullets, the sight that met their eyes
was one of still greater desolation
than that which the allied forces
by Michel SALMON
encountered at the same time in the
Ruhr. More than 6, 000 of the 9, 800
houses and other buildings which
had made up the town of Saar-
brücken were wholly or partially
destroyed. Acres of rubble were all
that was left of 65 % of the coun-
try's dwelling houses, 60 % of its
factories, 50 % of its public build-
ings, including churches and schools.
In all the chaos which prevailed
in the first few years of the occu-
pation of Germany, the position of
students in the Saar was particu-
larly difficult. No opportunities were
as yet open to them in the French
Universities, while the over-crowded
German universities could only
accept them in small numbers and
were, in any case, rather far away.
Those nearest-the Universities of
Heidelberg, Mainz, Frankfurt and
Bonn-to which students from the
Saar were in the habit of going, are
respectively some 95, 108, 135 and
162 miles from Saarbrucken by rail.
The extent of the disaster which
had overtaken the Saar, and the
: ; special situation in which the coun-
try was placed at a very early date.
developed a special attitude of mind
among the people of the Saar, and
especially among young University
students. The European University
of Saarbrucken was thus born of a
combination of local needs and more
general cultural considerations. Its
object was to become a'peaceful
meeting-place, a bridge linking two
great civilizations and cultures. It
was necessary to train engineers for
the mining and metallurgical indus-
tries, doctors specializing in indus-
trial diseases, lawyers and so forth,
with the least possible delay, but
these new leaders for the Saar were
to be brought up in a new spirit of
international understanding and co-
operation, in the interests of Eurcpe
as a whole.
The Faculty of Medicine was the
first to be established, at Homburg.
a small industrial town on the Ger-
man frontier, about 18 miles to the
east of Saarbrucken. Homburg is a
dull, grey town, whose only merit is
that it contains the best of the local
breweries and the model hospital to
which the medical Faculty is now
attached.
As early as 1846, Saar and French
doctors and a former Professor of
the University of Budapest began
giving lectures and clinical demons-
trations to about fifty students.
March 1947 saw the formal opening
of an"Institute of Higher Studies"
which, during the Winter Term of
the same year, was converted into a
fully-fledged University. Three of
the Faculties (Arts, Law and Science)
moved to Saarbrucken in 1948, and
new Departments were later set up
- the Institute of Metallurgical
Research, at which certificated met-
allurgical engineers are trained in
co-operation with the Faculty of
Science, the Institute of Interpreters
and the Institute of European Stu-
dies.
The legal authority for the estab-
lishment of the University is

### 70189: The University of Saarbrücken: a bridge linking two great European cultures

Page 4. FEBRUARY 1953
A lecturer at Saarbrucken. Languages mainly used are German and French, but English, Spanish and Italian are being
introduced. The faculty is almost as multi-national in composition as the student body : 250 professors, 10 nationalities.
A MULTILINGUAL UNIVERSITY
contained in Article 33 of the Saar
Constitution, which makes mention
of a University, and in the Franco-
Saar Cultural Convention, which
lays down that the two Governments
shall both contribute to the cost of
running the University. A decree
of the Saar Government, dated
3 April 1950, states the position of
the University more exactly. It is a
State institution with complete inde-
pendence in financial matters. Its
governing body is a Board of Mana-
gement consisting of representatives
of the authorities directly interested
in the development of the Univer-
sity ; the other administrative autho-
rities are the Rector, the Vice-Rec-
tor, the Secretariat and an academic
council consisting of all the Deans
and Vice-Deans of the Faculties.
As a European University (which
it is stated to be in Articles 3 and 4
of its Charter), in fact as an inter-
national university, Saarbriicken is
able to call upon the services of pro-
fessors and lecturers from different
countries and is open to students of
any nationality. The Planckstrasse
in Saarbriicken, where most of the
teaching staff of the University are
living in pre-fabricated houses
which have literally sprung up from
the ground in a few months, is a
very Babel where Oxford and Hei-
delberg, the Sorbonne and Sankt
Gallen (Switzerland), Cambridge
(United Kingdom) and Cambridge
(United States) meet and mingle.
I myself met, one after the other,
a German zoologist who had been
one of the lights of the University of
Shanghai, a Swi. ss psychologist car-
rying on the tradition of Claparede,
a librarian from Berlin and a Bel-
gian physicist. The 250 or so profes-
sors, assistants and lecturers of the
University of Saarbrücken are of
10 different nationalities. The 1, 300
students, for their part, include
nationals of 25 different countries-
980 being from the Saar, 136 from
Germany and 60 from France ; but
there are also American, Turkish,
Iranian, Israeli, Chinese and Viet-
Namese students, to mention only
those from outside Europe. The lan-
guages mainly used in teaching at
Saarbrucken are German and
French, which are treated on a
strictly equal footing.
From the practical point of view,
this system gives rise to some little
difficulty, with regard both to actual
teaching and to examinations. The
University has had to work out an
ingenious compromise between the
rigid syllabuses to which French
teachers are accustomed, leading
ultimately to the"agrégation", a
highly competitive examination, and
the much more flexible German sys-
tem with its various grades of
"Hauptamtlich"and"Nedenamtlich-
professor","Docent"and assistant.
In the same way, the Saar Univer-
sity examinations combine the
French"licence"with the'''Stadtexa-
men",'''Doktorat''and"Habilita-
tion"of the universities on the other
side of the Rhine.
Plans are already being made,
however, for the use of further lan-
guages in teaching. With the ap-
pointment of Professor Startup and
Professor Jeeves, English has been
officially introduced, closely followed
by Spanish and Italian. The Uni-
versity is, of course, not yet entirely
"run in". Nothing is as yet immu-
table in the form of its organization.
It is no easy matter to establish a
satisfactory system of bilingual or
trilingual teaching, not to mention
the other difficulties encountered.
But the foreign specialists who were
recently asked to serve on the Board
of Examiners at the public defence
of scientific theses were able to see
for themselves that there is nothing
impossible in such an undertaking.
The Saar students replied unhesita-
tingly to all their questions in
French, German or English, accord-
ing to the nationality of the person
addressing them.
A pale, wintry sun was playing
upon the few remaining leaves,
flashing on the windows of a build-
ing, and making the guard-tower
- a menacing snow-covered cone-
look harmless as a country steeple.
I walked across the campus of the
University with Professor Angelloz,
that eminent German scholar who
bears the proud title of"`Rector
Magnificus Universitatis Saravensis".
The University's domain is expanding
in every direction and pushing out
into the forest. Bulldozers are
cutting swathes through the trees,
excavators are breaking up the
frozen earth and hollowing out vast
craters in the soil.
"When we have completed our
five-year plan", the Rector mur-
mured confidentially to me,"we
shall be able to have a big sports-
ground here"-pointing out a part
of the forest as yet untouched-
"our Faculty of Science and our
Faculty of Arts, which are at present
too restricted for space, will be
extended in that direction ; the Uni-
versity hostels will be built over
there, and so on".
The foundations of the splendid
central library are already being
laid ; I was much impressed by the
model of it I saw in the Rector's
office-a great oblong reading-room
flanked by a tower ten storeys high,
with passenger and goods lifts, in
which the 100, 000 volumes at present
kept in different places about the
University, with new additions, will
be collected together and indexed.
We visited the group of University
hostels, where some 300 men and
women students are comfortably
housed for a monthly charge of
800 francs (1), the cheerful and
spotlessly clean"Mensa", or Univer-
sity restaurant, where students can
have the three main meals of the
day at a cost of 195 francs, the labo-
ratories and the lecture-theatres.
One of the buildings we visited was
taken over in a state of complete
dilapidation in 1946. It had origi-
nally housed the tanks of the Wehr-
macht unit and was deliberately set
on fire before the unit left. It now
contains the most up-to-date and
possibly the best-equipped physics
laboratory to be found in any Euro-
pean university.
Perhaps the most significant mo-
ment of my short stay in the Saar
was my visit to the geology labora-
tory. I was given a most warm and
friendly welcome by a young assis-
tant belonging to the country, who
led me to a great block of coal
covered by what looked like an
enormous dish-cover in one corner
of the room. Above it was a map of
the Saar coalfield, a great brown
streak of discoloration running from
north east to south west across the
greater part of the country."Our
daily bread", my guide called it, in
tones of the most serious signifi-
cance.
Thus, even in this forest vastness,
this haven where, thank heavens,
the horizon is still free from the
chimneys of collieries and blast fur-
naces, the Coal-God is yet present-
and omniI-otent. Even the Univer-
sity is inevitably subject to the laws
of geography."It must be our aim",
I was told,"to train the very best
mining and metallurgical engineers
here. We are particularly well placed
in Europe for such a purpose ; we
have centuries of experience behind
us which can be of use to students
all over the world. So far as Europe
is concerned, our University might
become, for the mining industry and
its ancillaries, what Princeton is for
mathematics, and Johns Hopkins for
medicine in the United States of
America. Students would come to us
not only because, under its Charter,
our University is international but,
even more, because they could be
sure of receiving here technical ins-
truction of truly international
worth."
The pursuit of such an aim by the
University of Saarbrucken seems to
us to be a most interesting develop-
ment. Thus, the multilingual Uni-
versity of Europe would then be able
not only to train officials to staff
any pan-European organization
which may be set up-the only pro-
bable career open, for the time being,
to students from countries other
than the Saar, taking the extremely
interesting courses at the Institute
of European Studies, for instance-
but also technicians, who would be
inspired by a desire and determina-
tion to found the future of Europe
on a recognition of the interdepen-
dence of our cultures and the need
for them to live side by side in peace.
(t) We may mention, in this connel'ion,
that the Europrnn University of the Soar is
highly democratic ; the feps are low, stlldcl1feare drawn from a.//sections of the country's
population. Twenty-sel'en l>er cent of shestudents come from worldng-class families
and nearby 20 per cent from the familil's of
clerks, small craftsmen, etc"in the imrer-
income groups.
Not far from a typical Saar landscape-factory chimneys and blast furnaces-
foundations are being ! aid for an ultra modern University library, a scale model
of which is shown on right. In this new building, the 100, 000 volumes at present
kept in different places about the University will be collected and indexed.

### 70187: Gold Coast: where the Education Ministry supervises work on rice fields, roads and bridges (Ghana)

FEBRUARY 1953. Page 5
AFRICA is certainly a continent
full of surprises. One of
them is to find that in cer-
tain places dikes, bridges,
roads, wells, conduits and
even rice paddies are being built
under the auspices of a ministry of
education.
What is even more astonishing to
anyone with a slight knowledge of
Africa is that the work has been
carried out enthusiastically and
voluntarily by Negroes from the most
isolated areas, who have not even
waited for the authorities to tell
them to start using their picks and
shovels for these public works !
I found this fact all the more
striking because I could remember
quite different attitudes among Afri-
cans. Not so long ago, for example,
I heard the health service director
in one of the continent's equatorial
territories complain that he could
not get men to accept jobs building
dispensaries intended exclusively for
the local population.
The Negroes of African countries,
regardless of the flag which flies
over them, still tend to shy away
from any collective activity, because
thev have so often been forced to
contribute to undertakings whose
value to them personally was far
from apparent. In some extreme
cases they still try to avoid work.
even when it is essential for their
own subsistence.
But men will work willingly as
soon as they see clearly that they are
contributing to improvements in
their own standards of living ; and
perhaps the best way to induce
Africans to work for themselves is to
apply Fundamental Education me-
thods as I have seen them in practice
in the British Gold Coast-methods
whose aim is simply to help people
to help themselve8.
The first problem in a colonial
territory is how to use such methods
without seeming to apply constraint,
and without arousing the suspicion
of hidden"imperialistic"motives.
The best way, unjust as it may seem,
is to make sure that the initiative
does not come from the officials who
exercise authority. Then it will not
take long for the villagers, the direct
beneficiaries of the scheme, to recog-
nize its advantages and co-operate
spontaneously with it.
But the distrust of some irrespons-
ible nationalists cannot be removed
so easily. In Nigeria, for example, I
listened to the protest of one of them
for whom Fundamental Education
was just another trick to ensure that,
as political power is turned over to
the Africans, the Europeans would
once again get the credit for being
the true benefactors of the popula-
tion.
For me, it was a strange objection.
I had just come from Liberia, where
the leaders of the only independent
country in this part of Africa were
eager for foreign co-operation in this
field. I had also been in the Gold
Coast, where Fundamental Education
is under the jurisdiction of an Afri-
can minister, and is carried out by
200 Africans and only six Europeans.
As a matter of fact, the Gold Coast
leaders welcome Fundamental Educa-
tion in this, the African colony
most advanced on the road to inde-
pendence. There is an African and
a nationalist majority in the Accra
legislative assembly and in Mr.
Nkrumah's Government. Both are
generous in their encouragement and
in the credits voted to the Depart-
ment of Social Welfare, the branch of
the Ministry of Education which is
responsible four Fundamental Educa-
tion in the colony. 
Last year this Department was
allowed H20, 000 for mass educa-
tion, in addition to £100, 000 in the
form of grants.. These relatively
large sums could be provided thanks
to the richness of the colony (it is
the world's largest producer of
cocoa).
Few countries in \Vest Africa
would be able to finance so great an
undertaking. The campaign here
is on a national scale, whereas
I'lséwhere it tends to be confined to
local or other limited experiments.
But even in the Gold Coast the
way in which the campaign is car-
ried out differs according to the
degree of development of the various
regions. The needs of the rich
Ashanti province in the south are
unlike those of the northern
territories.
The northern area has a quarter of
tlie population of the (, old Coast, and
roves a third of its total land sur-
face. But it has fewer than ten
doctors for 1, 000. 000 inhabitants, and

THE REMARKABLE STORY OF'MALIGU-NAA',
A MISSIONARY CHO BECAME A TRIBAL CHIEF
Maligu-Naa (Chief of the Preparations) is the title given to Mr. W. Lloyd Shirer, district mass
education and social welfare officer, by the Dagumba, a tribe numbering some 175, 000 people,
who are found in both the Gold Coast and Togoland. Mr. Shirer, a former missionary, is
seen here greeting a native chief, Mionlana, who uses a comfortable barber's chair as a throne.
Continued from previous page
an even smaller ratio of schools,
partly because the people were for
long unwilling to use them. The
villages lack water, food, roads, medi-
cal care-and how, with their own
small resources and revenues, would
the people be able to obtain such
things ?
The answer can be seen in the picks
and shovels at work at Janga, a
bulldozer which is kept busy at
Tampiong, cement and metal plates
that have arrived at Wungu---,. to
mention only a few villages in the
savarw between Tamale, the northern
'capital, and the frontier of Upper
Volta.
One village is to build a road over
which lorries will travel to collect
consignments of fish which pre-
viously could not be sent to market.
Another village plans to have its
half-ruined well cemented. A third
village knows that soon there will be
water on the spot for its people and
animals, instead of their having to go
and fetch it from several miles away ;
a dike near completion already holds
more reserves than ever existed
before in the region.
Better still, the water will permit
the irrigation of newly-made rice
paddies. This is particularly impor-
tant, for rice has not been grown
here before. The innovation would
certainly delight those agricultural
experts who believe that rice-grow-
ing in the tropics will not only im-
prove the health of the people, but
also the ravaged soil.
It remains to be seen whether the
people of Tampiong will eat the rice
they grow, instead of the yams to
which they are accustomed. But,
whether or not rice becomes part of
their diet, they will profit by it.
1.-This unusual looking
structure is one of the public
loudspeakers installed in the
villages of the colony by the
Gold Coast Department of In-
formation. 2.- The verna-
cular literature bureau for the
Gold Coast Northern Territories
at Tamalé supplies all the
publicatións and materials
needed for the mass education
campaign in this area. 3. - A
first step to fundamental educa-
tion in Tampiong was to im-
prove food and water supplies.
Here, a bulldozer provided by
the Department of Public
Works helps to construct a
dam. This will provide drink-
ing water for village people and
livestock and will also be used
to irrigate a new rice field.
With what they earn by its sale,
- some S200, a fortune for them-
they will be able to buy cloth and
other things they badly need.
Thousands of hours of work have
been put into undertakings of this
kind by local people. They contri-
buted their labour willingly, because
they could clearly see the practical
value to themselves of achievements
such as the several artificial lakes
t hat now shine in the sunlight near
Tamale, of the simple but strong
bridges, of the clean weUs, of the
latrines now used by everyone.
In some cases the villagers them-
!"elves conceived and undertook the
projects, and asked for technical
help. An example is the road from
Janga to Nassia. For 90 miles
: n'ound Tamale, this aid was given
bv an American named W. L. Shirer,
who was first known in the region as
a Protestant missionary. He has
since become at the same time a
British official and a native chief-
with a Catholic missionary, Brother
Aidan, as his principal helper.
The title, Maligu-Naa, which
means"Chief of the Preparations",
has appropriately been given to Mr.
Shirer, who stimulates the material
progress of the rural communities,
and helps the people get some
elements of rudimentary education.
'"Maligu-Naa"never stays long in
any single spot within the huge area
where he works. He travels, gives
advice, lends tools, which in many
cases he has borrowed from official
source, such as the hydraulic, rural,
agricultural, health and public works
services. Before he moves on, he
leaves people able to carry on the
good work.
The social welfare and mass educa-
tion service is a permanent insti-
tution in the Gold Coast. It has its

own staff, which is increasing
rapidly. It starts with probationers,
who must be local people, makes
them monitors, and assigns them to
travelling teams. To make this
possible, a rural training centre was
established in the northern region of
the Gold Coast, and another in the
Ashanti province. They are.'semin-
aries"for the new type of.'mis-
sionary".
Mr. Shirer is in charge of the
centre at Tamale, where he also
receives volunteers from villages in
the brush country. The enthusiasm
of these unpaid rural volunteers is
extraordinary. They find the days
too short for all they want to learn.
One group pleaded to be allowed to
stay at the centre not for two weeks,
but for two years !
Each workshop in the brush coun-
try has a Fundamental Education
team of from four to eleven members,
who stay for at least two months.
Their activities alone are enough to
change the whole life of a village by
improving such things as farm
methods and hygiene.
But the struggle against illiteracy
always remains the basis of the
team's work, and achievements of a
more spectacular nature should not
lead the visitor to forget it. The
certificates delivered to people who
have become literate are as impor-
tant in their way as the material
accomplishments of the villagers.
In the Gold Coast, as in every Brit-
ish colony, it has always been a
principle to teach in the local
dialect. The problem of"raw mater-
ials"this set in the campaign to
teach reading was solved by printing
textbooks not only in each of the
principal local languages, but also in
those never before written.
This explains the existence in the
small town of Tamalé of what is
probably the only real printing press
in this latitude between the Mediter-
ranean and the Gulf of Guinea.
Material in three different languages
is produced on its small but modern
machines, some of them of the kind
used by the American army in the
field.
In the few months during which
the press has operated, tens of
thousands of booklets have been
published and sold at half the cost
price : they include spelling books,
reading texts and collections of
sketches. Some reach a circulation
of over 5, 000. Except for Mrs. Shi-
rer, an American, who directs the
establishment, the staff is made up
entirely of Africans.
In the Ashanti province, Mr. Shi-
rer's opposite number is a New
Zealander, Mr. Owen Barton. The
local press mentions one or other of
his many activities almost every day.
Judging by the programme which
Mr. Shirer and Mr. Barton have ready
for the visitor the moment he gets
out of an aeroplane, and the distances
they expect him to travel, it is pjain
that they take little leisure from
their quite different tasks.
From the Ashanti province and its
magnificent forests, the Gold Coast
gets most of its wealth, thanks to
cocoa and wood. The people are
strong and active. Kumasi, the
capital, presents a spectacle of great
activity and animation, notably in its
market, one of the largest in the
world. Few African regions enjoy
such well-being, which shows itself
even in the villages by the size and
the architecture of the houses, by
the excellence of the shops and the
presence of many taxicabs.
The problem here, therefore, was
not so much to create the means by
which the communities might
develop ; rather it was to provide
technical advice and a framework
for the development. For each
village has all the facilities for
providing adult courses-but it
needs help in the setting up of a
committee for the struggle against
illiteracy.
The eagerness of the Ashantis to
team becomes quite plain when one
sees Mr. Barton, at each stop made by
his motor-car, being besieged by a
score of people eagerly offering their
3d. for a spelling book. In some
places, as many as 200 people attend
the courses.
If there is any African region in
which it is a sound and justified
policy to give aid in return for local
co-operation, that region is Ashanti.
Every year the government allocates
special funds for distribution as
grants to the communities, but they
are given only when the communities
themselves make contributions of
money or labour.
For example, a village which
wanted a post office provided half
the necessary cost. Another village
needed to level its main street and
flank it with gutters ; the womenfolk
took it in turns to come from the
different neighbourhoods to carry
away in pots and pans on their heads
the earth dug up by their men. A
third village which also decided to
make gutters for its streets was
provided with cement-and the
children helped their elders by ex-
terminating swarms of mosquitoes,
under the direction of a health
service agent.
Still another village decided to
move itself bodily to the side of the
Accra-Kumasi road, a mile away.
Mr. Barton took the opportunity to
tell its leaders about housing prin-
ciples, which may lead to the birth
of a model village.
The headquarters of all these activi-
ties is the rural training centre at
Kwaso, where Mr. Barton's 60 Afri-
can helpers learned how to carry out
their new tasks. They are now
scattered all over the region, and are
hard at work. Women have come to
the centre for five-day courses in
child care and nutrition. Unesco
has sent a student from Liberia.
I was able to observe all the activi-
ties on my tour through the forest,
from the making of new roads to
sewing lessons, from orchestra
rehearsals to adult education classes.
They confirmed eloquently the broad
scope and great value of the centre.
The undeniable benefits are ap-
propriately symbolized by the tribal
chief of Kwaso, who received me on
a throne framed on one side by a
portrait of Queen Elizabeth and the
Duke of Edinburgh, on the other by
a propaganda poster on the raising of
cocoa-and also by his own and his
grandson's literacy certificates.
Another indication is the fact that
village life has become so worth
while that this year far fewer people
left during the 'dead"season.
The task of freeing the African
peoples from ignorance and poverty
might sometimes seem insoluble. It
would be if the authorities tried to
cope with it by their own means
alone, hence taking the risk of finding
themselves unequal to the difficulties.
On the other hand, however, it can
be hoped that the"national cam-
paign"being conducted throughout
the Gold Coast, and especially its good
progress in the Ashanti region, will
show the possibility of working more
quickly and winning a whole people
through the co-operation of local
populations in an undertaking whose
meaning and benefits they understand.

### 70188: Cheapness and simplicity mark new UNESCO printing process

CHEAPNESS AND SIMPLICITY MARK
NEW UNESCO PRINTING PROCESS
Students study most effective design for future poster at Fundamental Education Training Centre set up by Unesco
at Patzcuaro, Mexico. Artists must pay great attention to local customs and dress if lesson is to have its full effect.
Artist engraves poster design directly in a mixture of paraffin wax and beeswax spread on glass plate. He cuts right
down to glass (see diagrams on right) and can easily correct any mistakes by melting a candle over the wax plate.
After engraving, a mixture of glue and glycerine is poured over wax. Finished plate (here being removed) has a rubbery
texture. Poster can be printed from it by inking its surface, laying down a sheet of paper and smoothing it down by hand.
by Daniel BEHRMAN
A new printing process, so cheap and
so simple that any teacher, aided
by an artist, can use it has recently
been developed at Patzcuaro, Mexifu.
Designed primarily for the production of posters,
the process is now in operation at the inter-
national centre known as CREFAL (Centre
Regional de Educacion Fundamental de America
Latina), set up by Unesco, the Organization of
American States and the Mexican Government,
to raise living standards through education hy
training badly-needed teachers of fundamental
education for Latin America.
The process consists simply of engraving on
wax, and from this wax"'positive", casting a
printing plate made of a mixture of carpenter's
glue and glycerine-the same as used to manufac-
ture printers'rollers. The result is a"'negative"
plate resembling a huge, flexible stamp from
which a poster can be printed even without a
press.'
The new process was developed as part of the
Patzcuaro centre's assignment to find simple,
inexpensive ways of producing the highly-
specialized materials needed in this form of
education-which often requires a teacher to
spend more time outside of the classroom than
in it.
Since the centre's opening in May 1951, its
staff has counted heavily on posters to make its
objectives known to the 14, 000 inhabitants of the
20 Tarascan Indian villages in which teams are
working to improve health and economic
conditions. With half the population illiterate
and newspapers and radios a rarity, posters were
found to be one of the few ways of reaching the
villagers. The centre relied on art to tell the
villagers of the need to boil water or to vaccinate
cattle against anthrax. For mere slogans, no
matter how bright or powerful, were useless
when people could not read them.
At first the production of these posters
presented a serious problem. Ordinarily, poster
production of realistic drawings (abstract art was
avoided for these villages) requires expensive
plates and a heavy-duty press. The. engraving
process on linoleum, for example, is an exacting
one, for one tiny slip by the artist can ruin a
plate.
The centre first tried poster printing by the
photo offset process, which is usually considered
an effective, low-cost method of producing
posters. In Patzcuaro, however, it presented an
endless series of difficulties.
Variations in electric current from 60 to 120
volts made it impossible to obtain a steady press
speed. During the rainy season, damp paper
would not go through the press properly. And,
finally, the press required a trained operator-a
rarity in most of the rural regions where the
centre's students from 16 Latin American
countries knew they would work after graduation.
Then, the head of Patzcuaro's production unit,
Senor Julio Castro of Uruguay, and a 36-year-old
American, Mr. Jerome Oberwager, began to hunt
for a solution. After months of experimenting,
during which they tested various materials such
as modelling clay, melted brown sugar, plaster,
tar and sealing wax, they finally evolved the
process now used by the centre.
It begins with the pouring of a mixture of
more or less equal quantities of paraffin wax and
beeswax onto a pane of glass set into a table
boarded on four sides. The beeswax, which at
Patzcuaro comes from the centre's own hives
where students are now being taught beekeeping,
serves to raise the melting point of the mixture.
When no beeswax or paraffin is available, candles
such as those used in many churches, can be
used, provided they are made of beeswax and not
of animal fat or petroleum.
After the mixture has solidified, the artist is
ready to engrave his poster. Unlike other engrav-

### 70188: Cheapness and simplicity mark new UNESCO printing process

Simple yet versatile method of printing produces lines
almost as fine as those of a steel or copper engraving.
This poster points out advantages of cooking meals
on a proper stove instead of over a smoky open fire.
The Spanish text of this poster could be translated as"You are never too old to learn". In Tarascan villages,
however, where the word"viejito" (little old man) is also the name of a traditional dance, the poster's double
meaning (you may dance, but you can also learn) is appreciated by the local people and has a greater effect.
ing processes, however, the artist first draws
his poster directly on the wax plate with Indian
ink or a pencil, or else he can spread a paper
drawing on the wax surface and trace the lines
and words lightly with a pencil or any sharp
instrument. No special tracing paper is needed
to do this ; any kind of paper will do. And by
using this method, even persons who are not
artists can achieve satisfactory results.
Once the drawing is completed, simple
engraving tools are used to carve out the wax.
Here again, the new process has an obvious
advantage : the artist is no longer forced to
"engrave in reverse"as in other methods. He
simply carves out the black lines and surfaces
which will appear in the finished poster. This
is the opposite of what is done in linoleum or
wood engraving, for example, where those parts
are cut out which will not appear in the final
poster.
When the engraving is completed, the wax
plate is placed in a wooden casting box and a
mixture of glue and glycerine is poured over it.
The finished plate has a rubbery texture, and a
poster can be printed from it merely by inking
its surface, laying down a sheet of paper and
smoothing it out by hand.
To speed up production, Mr. Oberwager and
his students have designed and built a wooden
printing press, which is so simple that any
carpenter can construct one. This hand press
accomplishes the inking and smoothing processes
in two simple strokes. (At the Patzcuaro centre,
the surface of the printing roller is made of the
stout cloth from which Tarascan Indian women
weave their skirts.)
A wide variety of posters have so far been
produced by this new glueplate process which
has reduced the cost per poster to less than two
cents. They have treated such subjects as
literacy, personal hygiene, cooking on a stove
instead of over a smoky open fire, and village
sanitation.
The process has shown many practical
advantages :
* It is cheap : the wax is melted down and used
over and over again and so are the printing
plates of glue and glycerine. In fact, provided
the glue and glycerine are kept clean, their
quality improves with use.
* There is no limit to the size of the poster that
can be produced ; a large poster merely means a
bigger pane of glass, more wax and more glue
and glycerine.
* It does not require an expensive press (the
wooden press at Patzcuaro was built with local
timber and materials bought in the markets).
* Artists can correct their mistakes while
engraving by melting a candle over the wax plate.
* It is versatile : it can produce lines almost as
fine as those of a steel or copper engraving as
well as huge block-letter signs.
* It makes printing possible on almost any kind
of material : cloth, wood, leather, glass, metal,
cement, plaster, and practically any kind of paper.
In fundamental education, local needs have to
be given full consideration. Only if the men,
women and children depicted. in posters wear
traditional costumes, and the objects drawn are
well-known to everybody, will the visual lesson
have its full effect on the population.
The Patzcuaro experiment has proved that any
forgotten detail, or any mistakes made by the
artists as far as the peasants'garb is concerned,
may reduce the importance, if not wholly destroy
the content and value of the lesson illustrated by
a poster.
The shape of a hat was enough to convince
Tarascans, for instance, that a certain poster did
not really show the way they should select their
seeds, but indicated the way this operation was
performed in a different region, with a different
climate altogether.
Therefore, the impact of such posters depends
more on their variety and specialized local
appeal than on a centralized, streamlined
production.
"Those who work daily on fundamental
education tasks"-says a booklet published by
Crefal under the title :"How To Print Posters"
-"must face continously new problems, which
require new solutions. To them we offer this
printing process. If they work on it with
patience and dedication, they will soon see their
efforts rewarded."

approach of the school's
prize distribution day ?
( ; ome now, the ques-
tion is really simple
enough to leave no plaue
for hypocrisy. Either one
believes in music, or one
doesn't. If it is regarded
as an"accomplishment",
the realm of a handful of
queer experts, yet suit-
able on occasion to dis-
tract ordinary people ; as
a stimulation to danc-
ing or an inspiration to
dreaming, for example,
or, most appropriate of
all, to provide a back-
ground to cocktail parties
and family meals, then,
in this case, all is well.
There is no problem to
discuss. Sol-fa exercises
twice a month are quite
adequate.
If-and what a con-
trast-one recognizes the
truth of the Orpheus le-
gend, then music can be
seen as the pre-emin-
ently civilizing art, and
by Andréa SALIERI
greatness and this power, a revolution is called
for. In teaching programmes and educational
systems music should have a leading place. It
should be introduced to children and adoles-
cents as something equally respectable and
useful as algebra, spelling and Latin grammar
are considered to be. If the word"useful"
tends to shock, then let us simply repeat the
witticism of Santayana who said that music
was as useless as life itself, but that no one
should renounce either one or the other.
In any case, let people make up their minds,
and not speak of education in music in Utopian
terms, as if they !"were dreamers or prophets.
For it is not a question of creating something
in the absolute. There is little to invent. The
teaching of music and even education through
music are not such recent discoveries or such
rare innovations as to call for the services of
pioneers or apostles.
It would not serve much purpose to recall
here the studies of a young Greek in the time
of Pericles, but we can say that in our own
"time education would hardly be conceivable in
.'more than one country in the East if it'were
not based on music. In Thailand, for example,
the natural environment of childhood is created
out of singing and dancing. The child's first
steps and words are linked with a folklore of
an exceptional richness and beauty. Later, in
the primary school, the universal medium for
learning is choral music. The family commun-
ity is its own orchestra, sometimes its own
theatre. Secondary studies on Western lines
undoubtedly tend tao remove the child little by
little from this magical realm. But he is to be
envied his happy, early days amid the subtle
moods of the sacred and secular songs and the
wonderful sounds of the Thai flutes, gongs,
drums and violins. When the first ten years of
life have been spent thus in cultivating a nobil-
ity of gesture and an accuracy of intonation, it
must be easy to refrain from vulgarity.
When I write. of such things I cannot help
recalling with regret a certain school, a very
modern one, which kept faithfully to the spirit
of official curricula and was situated in a
country whose artistic achievements are widely
praised. This school granted its pupils the right
to 23 minutes of music each week-a right
which the pupils themselves renounced'when
they reached the age of 15. No one
could really blame them, for these 23 minutes
seemed to be taken up'with the explanation of
a few absurd rules,'or the playing of several
records accompanied by a ritual admonition of
"Keep quiet ! Listen to this ; it is a fine piece
of music."Children who learned to play the
piano or violin elsewhere were even excused
from these"music lessons".
Yet, in the same city another school of similar
category, though much less official in charac-
ter, followed a secular tradition which excited
IT is an invaluable help for music teachers
and musicians seeking the best music
education methods in one country to be
able to compare their experiments with
those being tried elsewhere. They are, there-
fore, always anxious to exchange their ideas,
to harmonize their activities and generally to
develop a collaboration which they hope will
help to give the teaching of their chosen art its
full effectiveness.
There is little doubt that considerable pro-
gress will be made in extending and improving
music education through the work of the inter-
national conference on the place and the role
of music in the education of young people and
adults, which is to be held in Brussels next
June, as well as through the contacts it makes
possible.
However, the major problem which will
dominate the Brussels'meetings is not one that
can be resolved by the efforts of musicians,
teachers and musicologists alone. The real
problem to be solved is how to give music its
rightful place in the education of young people- the place it would certainly have if musicians
were given the final say in the matter.
But it is obvious that protagonists of the arts
are not at present in charge of education and oj
teaching programmes. It is known to every-
one that in both primary and secondary schools.
music is generally given the same place as
domestic economy and physical training, or by
preference comes after physical training. It is
added to the"also ran"subjects in the curri-
culum, it fills in the gaps in the week's pro-
gramme, if any exist. And as it does not reai ! y
form part of the normal studies imposed on the
children and demanded by the parents, no one
is required to take it seriously.
There is, of course, no lack of outstanding
exceptions which could be cited and I am
happy to have personal knowledge of several.
but exceptions have never disproved the most
minor of rules, and it must be admitted thai
music is offered to the majority of the school-
children of today as something they can well
do without-something childish or painfully
dull. In other words, music is denied them.
Yes ! in spite of records, concerts, the rad in
and the cinema, music is denied them. At
home and outside they hear more music that
Mozart ever did. All their lives they will Iw
surrounded by great waves of it, but they will
be like deaf people, or foreigners to whom. 
poem remains for ever incomprehensible even
To young people who have the irreplaceable experience of singing or playing together, music becomes an
everyday fact, something familiar and loved. Choirs, youth musical associations and orchestras already
exist in many schools and cities, but most children still lack the opportunity to share in such activities.
its study must be regarded as something
more than a question of ear and memory.
Also, the supreme role it plays in the develop-
ment of mind and character becomes clear-
just as clear today as in past centuries.
For he who accepts music in this role, be-
lieves, as did the ancient Chinese, that"by
music one becomes a man". He agrees with
Plato who called it.'this art which, regulating
the voice, reaches right to the soul and inspires
in it a taste for virtue."Or, like the theologians
of the Middle Ages, he sees it as a force for
"giving rhythm to the spirit". Finally, he does
not hesitate to repeat the words of Goethe :"He
'who does not like music does not deserve to be
called a man, hue'who likes it is already half it
man and he who plays it is a complete man."
From here it is a short step to speak of a
revolution, for if, indeed, music possesses this
In many countries of the East, music, like poetry, forms the basis of the tradi-
tional education. The family often constitutes an entire orchestra composed
of flutes, gongs, drums and stringed instruments. The Indian youth
shown here is playing a Surbahar, a sort of guitar with a deep, soft sound.

Music is not simply an"accomplishment". Its study is not just a question of ear and memory, but plays a supreme role in developing the mind and character.
both admiration and suspicion-it had an
excellent choir of which almost all the pupils
were members. The significance of the *words
"almost all"lies in the fact that there was no
obligation to join the choir and the frequent
rehearsals provided no excuse for neglecting
other studies. Here music existed as an every-
day fact, something familiar and loved. Right
from the start these youngsters had the irre-
placeable experience of singing together, joy-
fully and attentively under a discipline they
freely accepted. They acquired the basic
notions of music with little effort and by the
end of their studies they had a real command
of an extensive repertoire'which ranged from
Gregorian chants to the oratorios of Perosi, from
Palestrina to Ravel, from Handel to Verdi and
from Monteverdi to Malipiero. And I should
add that these"pueri-cantores"were just as
successful as other children when it came to
literary and scientific examinations.
One'wonders how such inequality can be
tolerated. For, in fact, are not the pupils in the
first of these two schools-typical of so many
more-victims of an injustice ? They are ex-
pected to become cultivated, but are only
shown the adventure of life in terms of books
and monuments. And then people are sur-
prised that these examples, however fine or
moving they may be, always strike the children
as unspeaking, empty and bookish. The
children lack, and will probably always lack,
an understanding of those form sounds through
which so many poems, peoples, dreams and as-
pirations would come to life and appear beforE
them. It is as if they'were being deprived of
one of their most precious senses.
And yet, all that is needed to right this wrong
is for the many existing examples of a proper
musical education to be increased, and for those
advantages from which a few children already
benefit to be extended to all. Everyone has
heard about the activities of school orchestras
and the remarkable successes they have
achieved in several countries. The interna-
tional work of the amateur musical associations
and the Musical Youth organizations whose
activities continue to develop are also well-
known. Then there are the school and church
choirs, natural'centres of musical culture,
where the intelligence and tastes of children
and young people are developed and moulded,
so that although they do not necessarily develop
into professional exponents, they do, in fact,
eventually become musicians and not merely
musical enthusiasts.
Choirs, associations and youth orchestras
already exist and work actively-usually with-
out much money or support-in this or that
city and school. But why not in every school
and in every city ? Why should the majority of
children be kept outside these activities ?
This again is not a problem for specialists
alone. No solutions will be forthcoming as
long as public opinion fails to recognize the
dignity of art, the special value of music in
education and the urgent need to give everyone
the same opportunities in this field, as in all
Others.
'QUIET ! LISTEN TO THE MUSIC ;
tT'S BEAUTIFUL'
The day such simple truths are admitted, it
will no longer be very difficult to bring about a
genuine introduction of music-teaching into
school programmes, to find the means to pay
for it, to provide proper training facilities for
teachers, and to encourage them to show appli-
cation and initiative in their task.
The gospel of free and compulsory educa-
tion appeared absurd when it was preached a
century ago. One day it will seem ridiculous
to have ever refused children their right to
music. Already in such countries as Wales
and Yugoslavia, where traditional art has been
preserved as a living reality, such a denial is
regarded as a crime. Then there are many
peoples, such as those in the non-industrialized
countries of Africa and Oceania, for whom no
such problem exists. And in certain other
countries, the revolution, which 1 referred to
earlier, has started and is going well.
One of the best examples of the progress that
has been made is the case of the United States.
Thirty years ago this country could not yet
point to any outstanding achievements on be-
half of music in its schools and colleges. There
is no doubt, of course, that things had improved
somewhat since the time when Chaliapin, the
great Russian bass declared :"'I pity Americans
because they have no light, no song in their
lives."But even so, music remained a pleas-
ure enjoyed hy a fortunate few. The possibil-
ity of all children and young people being able
. to share in it seemed at that time a far-fetched
idea. Yet today, 80 per cent of the 25, 000
secondary schools in the country have a band,
orchestra or choir-in many cases, all three-
and the same is true for the colleges. Altogether,
it is safe to say that most young Americans bet-
ween the ages of 10 and 20 now learn to
appreciate music and that more than three mil-
lion of them also.'make music".
The high musical calibre of these youngsters
was vouched for by Leopold Stokowski
when, from school orchestras all over the
country, he selected the members of his All-
American Youth Orchestra in 1940. Some 10, 000
young musicians from all States had auditions,
and from this number 560 were chosen as out-
standing. Mr. Stokowski listened to them all
and was amazed by the technical proficiency
and musical insight of these young performers,
many of whom, he said, were of professional
stature.
When one learns such facts it comes less as
a surprise to find Beethoven's'"Missa Solemnis"
in the repertoire of a choir whose members are
science, literature and agronomy students, or
to hear that a difficult composition by Arnold
Schoenberg was given its world premiere per-
formance in Albuquerque, New Mexico, by an
amateur orchestra largely made up of univer-
sity and secondary school students playing
under the direction of Kurt Frederick.
These rapid and impressive results are due
to the energy and enthusiasm of a handful of
people who, after forming associations to bring
together musicians and teachers, finally found-
ed an organization now known as the Music
Educators National Conference. Their uisest
decision was to go all out to arouse the interest
of the pubiic and, in particular, of the school-
going population. To do so, they appealed at
onE a d the same time to the curiosity, pride
and.'esprIt-de-corps"of the youngsters, and
even to their taste for dressing up. As a result
education in music was in many cases insti-
tuted at the demand of the students themselves.
It may be said that to ensure music its proper
place in school programmes it is first of all
necessary to provide for the musical education
of parents, so that they in turn demand it for
their children. But the change will come more
rapidly if all the musicians, music critics and
teachers and, in general, the music lovers in
every country band together to help break this
form of vicious circle once and for all.

### 70190: The Musician: man serves art; the educator: art serves man

Page 12. FEBRUARY 1953 UNESCO
A people celebrates
in music and poetry...
by Charles Seeger,
Head of Music and Arts Division, Pan American Union
International MusicCouncil, one of the young-
est of Unesco's children,
adopted at its First General
Assembly in February 1951 a
resolution to hold a conference
. on Music in General Education.
This is now scheduled for the
summer of this year in Brussels.
A number of problems are
posed by this project, some of
them met with in other fields of
endeavour, but all of them here
with a character of their own.
First, there is the question :
why limit the conference to
music in general education alone
- why not include the whole
problem of musical education,
or, as the Americans call it,
"music education" ? Second :
which should predominate-the
viewpoint of the professional
musician or that of the pro-
fessional educator ?
The first question is not
easily answered and may cause
considerable debate. As a
matter of fact, music education
has three main branches, whose
adepts in many parts of the
world are not any too congenial
towards each other, viz. : edu-
cation of the professional musi-
cian ; education of the scholar
or musicologist ; education of the
layman and his children. Adepts
of the first two are specialists
in music. The last-mentioned
are not specialists in music,
though they may be in other
fields of activity.
Up to relatively modern times,
and still in many regions, pro-
fessional taught professional,
and layman, the layman and his
children. The one inherited,
carried and transmitted quite a
different music tradition than
did the other. Their separation
as social classes maintained the
separate traditions in compara-
tive purity. But the increas-
ingly elaborate organization of
culture in the advanced civili-
zations has thrown this relative
balance out of joint. Social and
industrial, and, later, techno-
logical innovations have found
application in the field of music,
and mass media of communica-
tion have enlarged the distribu-
tion of some traditions and
narrowed that of others.
This skill, developed by the
inhabitants of cities, naturally
made use of the traditions best
known to them-those of popu-
lar and fine art, which were
entirely dependent or thought
to be, upon the techniques of
music writing (2written tradi-
tion). The great majority of
people were dependent upon a
vastly older technique-that of
unwritten or oral tradition. So,
about a century ago, profes-
sional musicians who were
interested in education decided
that the thing to do was to
teach the hordes of children
that were coming into state
sunnorted schools how to appre-
ciate and read written music.
The fallacy of this effort,
which has been so sincerely
propagandized by professional
musicians, lies in the fact that
there are not now, never have
been and never in the forseeable
future can be, enough competent
musicians who are also compe-
tent teachers to handle the vast
populations in our schools. For
unless the teacher is competent
as a musician, the professional
musician will judge, quite right-
ly, that the work is worse than
none. And unless the musician
is competent as a teacher, the
educator, equally rightly, will
make the same judgment. The
effort to build a musically lite-
rate public in the image of the
professional musician has, fur-
thermore, been resisted success-
fully by generations of children- particularly boys.
In the past, general educators
and administrators have never
given this effort the support that
musicians have demanded. Now,
at least in the United States,
they are even beginning to ad-
vance reasons for their opposi-
tion. In short, basic education
in music and music in basic
education have gotten off these
past hundred years to a bad
start. Or, to change the meta-
phor, the cake has lovely frost-
ing, but is hollow inside. For
music is mainly in the making
of it-not in the listening to
someone else making it.
The implications are not far
to seek. While small sections
of populations will continue
serious study of the traditions of
the fine and popular arts, and
an increasing minority will mix
the professional and lay tradi-
tions, the great mass of the
people will continue to be taught
by persons like themselves-
persons who make music of a
kind quite different from that
of the professional tradition.
In short, layman will continue
to teach the layman and his
children. But it cannot be the
old type of layman-the folk-
singer who handed on, practi-
cally uncriticized, the art he had
learned. A new type of lay
teacher must oe evolved-one
who can utilize some of the pro-
fessional techniques but who
will steadfastly resist the effort
(that has failed so disastrously)
to cast the layman and his
children into the mould of the
utterly incompetent profes-
sional.
It is here that the scholar,
that shadowy and almost unre-
cognized figure who has re-
mained in the background of the
controversy, must be called
from his preoccupation with
history to study oral tradition,
discover how it works and how
it may be adjusted to written
tradition and to the new con-
ditions under which both flow-
rish today. With his mediation,
too, it may be possible to answer
our second question : Which
should predominate-the view-
point of the professional musi-
cian or that of the professional
educator ?
There is a real quandary here.
The points of view of the
musician and the general
educator are becoming more
and more clearly opposed to
each other. The musician tra-
ditionally emphasizes subject
matter-devotion of the person
to the art. The educator, on the
other hand, has increasingly
more interest in the growth of
the child than in subject matter.
As the musician sees it, man
must serve art. As the educator
sees it, art must serve man.
Any sane general policy must
allow leeway for both. Each
should dominate in its proper
place.
May we not hope for a balance
between these opposed views, a
willingness on both sides to sit
down and work out, with what
help scholarship may afford, a
basic treaty to live and let live,
to co-onerate and advance side-
by-side ? This is not impossible.
But a lot of hatchets will have
to be buried.

### 70191: The Welsh Eisteddfod: a people celebrates in music and poetry

THE visitor who crosses the borderfrom saxon England to celtic
Wales cannot fail to realize
that he has entered the Land of
Music. Here everyone sings. Song
is as natural in Wales as ordinary
conversation on the other side of the
river Usk. Perhaps this results
partly from the fact that life is often
hard and austere, and partly because
the Welsh are a people devoted to an
ancient tradition of song and poetry
that can be traced back to the rites
of the Druids and the Gathering of
the Bards.
This tradition of the Bards has, in
fact, never quite died out. Today it
flourishes in the form of the National
Eisteddfod, a festival held each year
in a different town or village, alter-
nately in North and South Wales.
All the year long, musicians and poets
prepare themselves. The miners of
the Rhondda Valley spend their
evenings practising in the male
choirs that are the glory of Wales ;
in the high, sheep-farming lands, in
Caernarvon and Merioneth, men and
women trudge for miles by night
from their isolated farms to join in
the singing of the great choruses
from the"Mes-
siah", the"Eli-
jah"or songs
by local com-
posers. ash
over the coun-
try, people are
hard at work
at the poem-
written in the
t. traditional
Welsh metre which is one of the
most ancient and difficult verse
forms-that will perhaps win the
supreme recompense of the Bardic
Chair. Even the children spend most
of the year busily preparing for the
junior singing and dancing competi-
tions.
Last year, the Eisteddfod was held
at Aberystwyth and the little town,
as well as the neighbouring villages
in a radius of nearly twenty miles,
was packed with visitors. Some of
them had travelled from Canada,
from the United States, from South
Africa-for these people are great
travellers, given to emigrating, but
eternally homesick for their own
country. There were the London
Welsh too, come to encourage their
own choir, and Bretons from France
- Celtic cousins, speaking a language
sufficiently similar to make them-
selves understood.
The Eisteddfod is essentially a
manifestation of local patriotism and
it is a point of honour that only
Welsh should be spoken. Each year
there are a few practical-minded
people to point out that many more
tourists would come from England,
and some of the Committee's finan-
cial difficulties would be solved, if
a part of the judging were to be in
English. But the motion is always
voted down. There will always be
someone ready with a courteous
translation for the visitor from over
'the border, but the Welsh insist that
this festival should remain the living
proof of the vitality of the Welsh
language.
In the same spirit, preference is
given to works by local composers.
The Mixed Choir event was won last
year by the Skewen Choir, singing
... THE WELSH
EISTEDDFOD
by Cecily Mackworth
Arwel Hughes'Gweddi, while the
winning Male Voice was Treor-
chy (the mining village that is one of
the leading centres of music in the
country) singing a Welsh version of
the Twenty-Third Psalm. On the
other hand, the cup for the finest
solo voice was won by a farmer from
Penmaenfach, R. H. Rees, with the
bass solo from the Messiah,"Why do
the Nations..."
Competitors of these events know
that they are singing before a terribly
severe audience. Musical culture
here is not confined to specialists or
even to the more educated classes.
It is innate in the average workman,
agricultural labourer, miner, and the
slightest fault is instantly noticed
and commented on. Indeed, one of
the most curious things about the
Eisteddfod is the violent and highly
technical discussions among the pub-
lic that are heard after each item.
The judges of the GOTsedd (the
group of Bards) are severe, too, and
fast year they refused to award the
Eisteddfod Crown for the best poem
in modern metre. There were plenty
of other awards, however, for the
Eisteddfod though chiefly concerned
wnn music ana
poetry, covers
every branch of
culture.
But the great
moment, the
apotheosis of
the Eisteddfod,
comes with the
Chairing of the
Bard. Twenty-
thousand people waited last year in
breathless excitement for the Chief
Druid to name the man whom all
Wales will revere, for the next twelve
months, as her leading poet. Flank-
ed by the blind, ninety-two year-old
ex-Chief Druid, by the Hecorder and
the Keeper of the Sword, all in their
long white robes and veils ; with the
green-clad GOTsedd of Bards behind
him, the Chief Druid began his allo-
cution.
E'oquence is one of the leading
traditions here, and a great Weal. 4h
preacher must be able to play on the
emotions of his audience as a musi-
cian plays on the instrument of his
choice. As the tension mounted, the
cries of Hwll ! broke in tribute from
the body of the hall. At last the
name was proclaimed : John Evans, a
school-master from Llanegryn, for
his ode on Dwylo (Hands). Then the
thousands of voices broke into the
National Hymn,"Land of my Fa-
thers", while the procession of Druids
and Bards wound its way through the
crowd to fetch the victor and carry
him in triumph to the stage, where
he was enthroned in the Bardic Chair.
Eisteddfod week finished with a
performance of"Carmen", translatedmto Welsh by a local scholar and
performed by the Welsh National
Opera Company. Then it was all
over. Audience and competitors were
back at work next day-down in the
mines, tending their beasts in the
mountains, teaching in the little
country schools. One Eisteddfod is
finished, but another is in sight and
already the choirs are at practice on
Saturday evenings, the harpists, the
poets, the players of penillion, are
dreaming of success... next time.
A historic moment during a Welsh National Eisteddfod : H. M. Queen Elizabeth
is invested as Honorary Ovate of the Gorsedd of the Bards of Wales, at a ceremo-
ny at Mountain Ash, Glamorgan, in 1946, before she succeeded to the throne.

### 70193: The Wisdom of Ul-Jahiz crosses the frontier

COURIER FEBRUARY 1953. Page 13
A fanciful representation of the Tower of Babel, painted by Pieter Brueghel
the Elder. This work was recently shown in Paris for the first time as part of
the D. G. Van Beuningen Collection. The Tower of Babel is the symbol of
incomprehension between peoples resulting from the inability to understand
one another's languages. Modern archaeological research has discovered
that the Tower of Babel was actually built by the ancient Mesopotamians near
the Euphrates River (present-day Iraq). The Tower was the greatest of the
Sumerian-Babylonian ziggurat temples, or staged pyramids, with a total height
of 288 feet. Fifty-eight million bricks were used to build the Tower, which
was also known as the"House of the Foundations of Heaven and Earth"
THE W) SDOM OF UL-JAHtZ CROSSES THE FRONTIER
MANY an author has won fame in his own countryand, long after his death, his books continue to
be admired and to give pleasure-but only to
the relatively few who happen to know the same language.
To the rest of the world he is unknown and will probably
remain so.
And then suddenly comes a change. Someone decides
to translate him into a language understood by perhaps
50 or 100 million people. Our author, long dead, takes
wings. He finds a welcome among strangers. To them
he brings new treasure, something of the wit, wisdom and
poetry of his own folk and times.
This does not happen as often as might be imagined,
but it has now happened to a rare man of letters who
died eleven centuries ago. The name of Abu Uthman
'Amr Ibn Bahr UI-Jahiz was unknown outside the Moslem
world (except to a few orientalists) until his Book of
Misers was translated into French by Charles Pellat and
published recently in the Unesco Collection of Repre-
sentative Works.
UI-Jahiz was born in 776 or 777 A. D at Basra, then
a flourishing city, traversed by countless canals, thronged
with merchants, singers and grammarians, the gateway to
the East and a centre of Mesopotamian trade with India
and China. Its inhabitants were notorious for their sharp
wit and difficult character.
But UI-Jahiz seems to have inherited only their
intellectual capacities. Tactful and polite, he knew that
a man of culture deserves a quiet life, one that neither
requires him to stake his all upon reputation, nor makes
excessive calls for self-denial.
Though he was a contemporary of Charlemagne, his
career in the craft of letters was like that of any talented,
ambitious young man in 17th century Europe. Success
meant living in the capital and finding a patron there.
For an author who wished to live by his pen, there
was no alternative but to offer a few dedications in return
for gifts and a pension.
UI-Jahiz, therefore, dedicated a book to the Caliph-and
became a success in Baghdad. But his success owed
nothing to sycophancy. There are no fulsome praises
in his book, ! which is about the thorniest and most
controversial problems of those times, the political and
religious system of the Caliphate. It does not take
sides, but gives an unruffled account of the most divergent
trends of opinion.
All subjects came naturally to his pen : theology,
natural history, poetry, geography. Neither palace
revolutions nor revolts disturbed his output. The Vizir
fell into disgrace, the Caliph died. Their rivals and
successors Were equally friendly to UI-J ahiz, who grew
old wisely and only retired from the Court when
compelled to do so by a stroke and rheumatism.
Ul-Jahiz'Book of Beasts and Abu-Hanifa's Botany are
among the first works devoted to the study of nature.
by Georges FRADIER
The Book of Beasts contains many quotations from
Aristotle, though Greek influences are not otherwise
particularly conspicuous. There are also passages from
the poets, used-as in all mediaeval treatises-"to point
a moral and adorn a tale".
But our author has set down some observations of his
own as well. His object is to prove the unity of nature,
to show how, in the eyes of a sage, all things in nature
are of equal value. He had an odd predilection for
insects-and the Book of breasts foreshadows certain
modern theories concerning the evolution and adaptation
of species.
UI-Jahiz, however, was not a scientist, nor a specialist
in any particular subject. He Wrote books on COTn and
the Palm-tree, on Metals, on Whites and Negroes,
though not as one versed in the science of husbandry,
or of metal, or of mankind. His aim was to give a
stimulus to such studies-and pleasure to the reader.
Even when he wrote about theology, elegance of style
did not desert him : he eschewed speculative theories in
favour of historical fact and personal experience.
The Book of Misers, for instance, is not an essay on
avarice, but a collection of anecdotes, recollections, apt
quotations and original ideas, the whole apparently flung
together haphazardly. It is the obiter dicta of a sage
with a smile on his lips and a fluent pen, who has
ceased to have much faith in education, and refers to
it only with a touch of humour.
"In this book", he writes,."shalt thou find three
things-original arguments, subtle artifices, amusing
tales. Therein mayst thou draw, according to thy
mood, matter for laughter and distraction, if grave
things weary thee".
And thereupon he launches out-he has always a
weakness for digressions-upon an enchanting apology for
mirth. But he closes in dignified fashion :
"Laughter and jesting have their measure and
golden mean. That boundary passed, we fall into
frivolity ; but short of it, we are found wanting
in the scales."
The main pleasure in this book for us today lies in
the picture it paints of mice and men. Few are the
historical documents so close to life and the stuff of
things. The Book of Misers throws a dazzling light on
Mesopotamian society in the ninth century. It describes
its customs, fashions, culture, folklore, money troubles,
police, trade, the funny stories men told each other and
what they ate-in fact, the whole'ladle of daily life, which
is ignored by schoolroom history.
Our author did not think of depicting only misers in
this work, and when he comes to them, he supplies us
with an essay on manners. And strange birds they
are, his misers. Their vice is usually kept for the dinner-
table, like the one who rationed his guests'helpings, but
loaded them with gold and jewels !
We have a glimpse of a brilliant civilization, though
one not far removed from the austere living of the
nomadic tribes who gave it birth, and still imbued with
the poetry wherewith the men of the desert transmuted
their poverty into gold. Listen to a Bedouin describing
his meal :
"They brought us wheat red as nightingales'beaks,
and we kneaded bread, which we threw upon the
fire ; the embers tumbled out as the belly tumbles
over the belt. We then made of it a pottage that
went around in the melted fat as the hyena goes
around in the sandhills. Then they brought us
dates like the throats of lizards, so soft that the teeth
sank into them."
UI. Jahiz had too much learning and too keen a sense
of humour to compose this prose poem himself, but he
must have felt happy as he copied it out. Through
it we catch a glimpse of one who was always good
company, a man of insatiable curiosity, not very deep,
but always on the watch for"wise saws and modern
instances"wherewith to make his meaning clear and help
the mutual understanding of peoples.
The Book of Misers was one of a series of essays on
society : others include Of Thieves, Of Young Lovers, Of
Schoolmasters, and Of Singers. The essay on Women
is crammed with sex psychology and, in another series,
our author pleads for equality among the three races that
then made up the Moslem world-the Arabs, the Persians
and the Turks.
All Basra mourned him when he died at the ripe old
age of 91. They mourned him as ail admirable writer,
but above all, as a lovable man. It is a pity we have
no portrait of him. He was, it seems, extremely ugly,
with big bulging eyes, and that is the meaning of his
nickname, Ul-Jahiz. It is, too, the reason why the Caliph
AI-Mutawakkil felt unable to make him tutor to his
sons.
But we are reminded of Socrates ; his ugliness must
have been offset by his smile and his intelligence, and
it must have been forgotten in the enchantment of his
speech. Maybe he would not have stuffed his pupils
with strategy and the Law of the Koran. He would
have taught them to cultivate an open and inquisitive
mind, tolerance, a taste for friendship, respect for their
mother tongue, the whole seasoned with a pinch of
scepticism, for he would certainly have imparted all he
had to give.
It would perhaps be fantastical to see in him an early
Francis Bacon. In any case the sons of the Caliph are
to be pitied for what they missed.

Page 14. FEBRUARY ì953
RESTORING QUAKE-HIT CUZCO
ON Sunday afternoon, May 21, 1950, many ofthe people of Cuzco, Peru, were gathered
outside the city watching a football game.
They could see, in the distance, the stupendous
stone structures of the ancient empire of the Incas
glistening in the bright mid-day sun. Suddenly,
at 1. 39 p, m., the ground began to shake and
tremble. A few minutes later, over 100 persons
inside Cuzco were dead and more than 200 were
injured. The city itself was a shambles. Three
thousand dwellings were destroyed, and only
1, 200 remained habitable. The total damage was
estimated at over $33, 000, 000.
Cuzco is really three cities. One is Inca. The
second is colonial. The third is modern. The
numerous monuments of this ancient city testify
to its important role during the different periods
of its long history, which links the civilization of
the pre-Columbian Incas to the present time. A
great number of these monuments were seriously
damaged by the earthquake.
Immediately following the catastrophe, the
Peruvian Government took steps to remedy the
appalling conditions of the city. A special appro-
priation'was later voted by the Congress for the
reconstruction of churches and historical monu-
ments. Opinion, however, was divided over the
best way to plan this work and agreement
appeared difficult. The Peruvian Government
therefore asked Unesco to send an international
technical mission to help in formulating the plans.
In June, 1951, a Unesco mission, headed by
Professor George Kubler of Yale University,
arrived at Cuzco. It made a survey of the damage
and drafted a plan for reconstruction. These are
now incorporated in an illustrated volume, just
published by Unesco, entitled"Cuzco : Recons-
truction of the Town and Restoration of its
Monuments" (1). A detailed description of the
earthquake damage is given, covering religious
architecture, colonial dwellings, streets and
squares. Ultimately, the book points out, the
Cuzco Development Authority, established by the
Peruvian Government in co-operation with the
U. N. Technical Assistance Administration, will
assume control of the reconstruction of Cuzco.

### 70195: Human nature cannot be changed'; false, says U.S. anthropologist

HUMAN
FALSE
Theories on human nature have been as
numerous as the proverbial leaves of
Vallombrosa, but it was not until the
beginning of the twentieth century that
human nature became a subject of serious
scientific study. This study has revealed a
multiplicity of facts which should serve as a
challenge to social thinkers and the leaders
of public opinion.
"human nature"can mean several different
but mutually reconcilable things at one and
the same time, so that until we have explored
these different meanings and reconciled them,
it will not be possible to make a brief, valid
and readily understandable statement as to
the nature of hun. an nature. However, it is
possible to say several significant things
about it at once.
First it should be said that no organism of
the species so prematurely named Homo So-
piens is born with human nature. What
human beings are born with is merely a com-
plex of potentialities. Being human is not a
status with which but to which one is
born. Being human must be learned. This
is an important distinction, for the age-old
belief in the innate character of human na-
ture has been responsible for much personal,
social, and political misunderstanding, and for
an untold amount of human suffering.
What are the specific qualities or character-
istics, and what is the peculLar nature, of
man that distinguish him from all other crea-
tures ? On the basis of his obvious physic-
o ! characteristics man is described as a mam-
mal of the order Primates, genus Homo, and
species sapiens. But what of his psychologic-
al classification ?
Human Premise--
While every creature that is classified
physically as man is thereby called
Homo sapiens, no such cre ture is
really human until it exhibits
the conduct characteristic of a human
being. If it is true that one has to learn
the kind of conduct that is uniquely human,
then any organism which fails to learn that
conduct cannot be human. In a sense this is
a sound argument, and a closer examination
of this argument will serve to throw much
needed light upon the meaning of human
nature.
The fact is that man is human by virtue
of both his physical and his mental traits.
In the course of his evolution the two appear
to have gone hand in hand. One can no
more deny the status of being human to a
newborn baby because it cannot talk, than
'because it cannot wa) k erect. The wonder-
ful thing about a baby is its promise, not its
performance-a promise to perform under
certain auspices. A juvenile ape can do a
great deal more than can a juvenile human,
but the promise of the child far exceeds that
of the brightest of apes.
Now, what is this promise ? The answer
is : a remarkable capacity for learning to use
complex symbols and symbol relationships, a
symbol being a meaning or value conferred
by those who use. it upon any thing. A sign,
on the other hand, belongs to the physical
world, it is a physical thing which indicates
some other thing or event. A symbol
belongs to the human world of meaning.
Now, it is generally agreed that newborn
babies are incapable of symbol usage ; it is an
af>ility which they have to learn ; if they are
not taught it they do not learn it.
We can thus say that human nature means
the uniquely human set of potentialities for
being human with which the organism Homo
sapiens is born. Potentialities must be
underscored, for what is generally erroneously
assumed is that human beings are born with
certain definite traits and characteristics
which only need time if they are to develop,
whereas the researches of the last 30 years
have increasingly shown that the traits and
characteristics of the organism will to a very
large extent be determined by the kind of
cultural stimulation which those potentialities
Man's second nature
What most persons have taken to be
human nature, is actually the
acquired b haviour of he person ;
this may and usually does become
a second nature, and this, too, could be cal-
led human nature, since it is a function of
man's nature in interaction with his environ-
ment, but it must not be confused with man's
inborn nature-and this is exactly where the
confusion is usually made. Hence, human
nature may express itself, or rather be made
to express itself, in many different forms.
But the differences in these forms are not,

NATURE CANNOT BE CHANGED'
SAYS U. S. ANTHROPOLOGIST
according to modern evidence, determined by
innate factors but by environmental ones.
Man is born not with the ability to speak
any language, but with a capacity or potent-
iality for speech, and this potentiality will
never develop in the absence of the proper
stimuli. These stimuli will usually assume a
form determined by a particular environment,
so that what the organism learns to speak
will be of purely social origin, just as the way
in which he learns to eat will be socially
determined. Now languages, knives and
forks, and fingers, are all instruments for
manipulating one's environment, but whereas
fingers are natural, languages and knives
and forks are artificial. Obviously it is no
part of the primary or innate nature of man
to create artifacts.
by At. F. ASHLE. Y MONTAGU
Professor of Anthropology at Rutgers University U. S. A.
On this page we offer our readers a condensed version of an article which
appeared in the winter 1952 issue of"Impact of Science on Society"the
quarterly review published by Unesco. Professor Ashley Montagu presents
the results of some recent scientific research into the character of human
nature, and offers some of his conclusions on this controversial question.
Acquired experience
Science knows of no natural drive in man
to make knives and forks or to speak
Italian ; Australian aborigines neither use
knives or forks nor do they speak Italian,
not because they couldn't do so, but because
human nature frequently differs owing to dif-
ferences in the history of cultural experience.
In short, human nature assumes secondary
forms according to the pattern of the sociali-
zation process in which it has undergone
development, and this pattern is determined
by the cultural history of the group.
In the tradition of Western civilization it is
the custom to reckon age as beginning from
birth ; other civilization, notably the Chin-
ese, reckon age as beginning from fertiliza-
tion or conception. Recent researches indi-
cate that this is scientifically a much sounder
events of greater moment, than all the three-
score and ten years that follow it."It has
taken science 150 years to come somewhere
near supporting Coleridge's guess.
It is now a demonstrable fact that there
is a very intimate connexion between the ner-
vous system of both mother and foetus acting
through the fluid medium of the blood (and
its oxygen and carbon-dioxide content).
There is good evidence that an emotionolly
disturbed pregnant woman may communicate
her emotional disturbance, at least in chem-
A baby Homo Sapiens : Was he born with human nature ?
they happen to be born into a cultural en-
vironment from which such instruments are
absent and where their own language alone
is spoken.
In short, how a person will behave, what he
will do, think, or say, what language he will
say it in, and what artifacts he will prize,
will be determined not by his innate nature
so much as by his acquired experience. And
this gives us the answer we have been seeking :
human nature consists of the unique potent-
ialities for complex symbol usage with which
the organism is born, potentialities which un-
dergo development within a cultural environ-
ment, the result being a human being, made
to measure, and tailored to the prevailing cul-
tural pattern in which he has been condition-
ed. The process of learning the traditional
cultural patterns is called socialization, and
is essentially cultural in character. We
may, then, call the cultural endowment of
human potentialities primary human nature,
and the socialized development of those
potentialities secondary human nature. Human
nature, therefore, consists of both primary and
secondary elements, the innate and the
acquired. Where most errors have been
committed in the past has been in the iden-
tication of the latter with the former.
While the primary human nature of all
men is fundamentally similar, the secondary
manner of reckoning age than our own. The
tendency to think of the child being born as
a sort of tabula rasa, without a previous his-
tory, and beginning life, as it were, for the
first time at birth, is wrong.
The teaching in our scientific institutions
hitherto has been that the foetus in utero is
so carefully protected, so thoroughly insulated
from virtually all stimulations originating in
the mother or the outside world, that it deve-
lops autochthonously according to its own inner
resources and the nutriment which it receives
through the placenta. It was and still is
being widely taught that since there is no ner-
vous connexion between mother and foetus,
the mother's nervous states could not possibly
influence the development of the foetus in any
way.
Life before birth
With such a viewpoint concerning
maternal-foetal relations it is not to
be wondered at that the prenatal pe-
riod was considered irrelevant for
the study of human nature. And yet nearly
a century and a half ago a poet and
thinker, Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772-
1834), wrote :"Yes ! the history of a man for
the nine months preceding his birth, would,
probably, be far more interesting, and contain
ical form, to her foetus. The Fels Insti-
tute workers at Antioch College, Yellow
Springs, Ohio, have found that emotional dis-
turbances in the pregnant mother produce a
marked increase in the activity of the foetus.
They have also found that fatigue in the
mother will produce hyperactivity in the foe-
tus ; and that under severe emotional stress,
especially during the later months of preg-
nancy, such mothers generally have babies
who become hyperactive, irritable, squirming,
feeding problems.
Such an infant, says Sontag :"is to all
intents and purposes a neurotic infant when
he is born-the result of an unsatisfactory
foetal environment. In this instance he has
not had to wait until childhood for a bad
home situation or other cause to make him
neurotic. It has been done for him before
he has even seen the light of day."
Not only this, there is evidence that the
mother's emotionat disturbances are reflected,
through disturbances in nutrition, in the
skeletal system of the foetus. It is, of course,
not being suggested that the mother's emo-
tional states as such are transmitted to the
foetus-this is almost certainly not the
case. What does apparently occur is that
the mother's emotional disturbance manifests
itself in impulses which proceed to the pituit-
ary gland. The latter then secretes various
hormones directly into the blood stream
which activates the glands of the rest of the
body, and since most, if not all, of these hor-
mones are of small enough molecular size, they
will pass directly through the placenta into
the foetus, and there act upon it.
It is now well established that the foetus is
capable of responding to tactile stimuli, to
vibrations, differences in pitch and tone, and
to sound, to taste, and to various gases. In
other words, it is clear that far from being
thoroughly insulated from the outside world,
the foetal organism is a great deal more
sensitive to it than we ever suspected.
Creature of habit
It is generally agreed that man is born freE
of those biological predeterminants of
behaviour which characterize othe  ani-
malts. man is born without instincts,
without those psychological dispositions which
cause other animals to respond in a particular
manner to a particular stimulus accompanied by
a particular emotion. The form of the oni-
mal's responses is predetermined, man has
to learn the forms which his responses assume.
While other animals are mostly creatures of
instinct, man is the creature of habit-the
habit which he acquires from his culture. But
these habits are organized by his culture
around a number of urges, drives or basic
needs as they have been variously called.
These terms are the merest labels for physio-
logical conditions, the exact nature of which
is far from being known.
There is fairly general agreement as to
the number and definition of basic needs. A
basic need may be defined as a requirement
of the organism which must be fulfilled if the
organism and the group are to survive. The
main basic needs are : oxygen-hunger, thirst,
food, activity, rest, sleep, bowel and bladder
elimination, sex, fear, and avoidance of pain.
Malinowski has defined the concept of basic
needs as"the environmental and biological
conditions which must be fulfilled for the sur-
vival of the individual and the group."
It is important to note that this definition
includes the group as well as the indi-
vidual, and this inclusion constitutes one
of the most significant departures from,
and improvement upon, the old concept of
"instinct". It constitutes an explicit recog-
nition of the fact that man, if not all other
animals, functions, if he functions at all, in
relation to a group ; and that, so far as human
beings are concerned, functioning, that is
behaving, apart from a group simply does not
occur. When human beings behave socially it
means that they have been socialized within a
human group-if they have not been socialized
within a human group, then they do not behave
like human beings (1). Indeed, the person
becomes related to himself to the extent to
which he becomes related to the group.
Traditional myth
One of the prevailing myths of our
Western tradition is the belief that
the baby is born inheriting some-
thing of the ancestry of its lowly
forbears, with respect not only to its
physical but also to its psychological traits.
The alleged"aggressiveness"of animal nature,
it has been held, is in part inherited by the
young Homo sapiens. Freudian and Jungian
psychology assumes the innate aggressiveness
of man, and civilization is regarded by both as
a more or less unsuccessful attempt to keep
this innate aggressiveness within hounds.
Freud's postulation of a"death instinct"IS
now generally discredited but his use of the
synonymous term,"the destructive instinct",
still plays a considerable role in psycho-anat-
ytically influenced writings. This alleged
"destructiveness"is identified with man's
alleged inherited aggressiveness, and so one
of the dominant views about human nature in
our own day has become associated with the
belief that man is inherently born aggressive.
For this viewpoint there is not a shred of
supporting evidence. On the contrary, all the
available evidence gathered by competent
investigators indicates that man is born
without any aggressiveness within him what-
soever.

several recorded cases of children who hove been
almost completely isolated from human contact for
several years (these cases will be discussed in a

children fail almost completely to develop as

psychically blind and deaf, unable to walk or run,
and unable to make more than the most
elementary sounds.

### 70195: Human nature cannot be changed'; false, says U.S. anthropologist

'YOU CANNOT CHANGE HUMAN NATURE'
FALSE ! SAYS MODERN ANTHROPOLOGIST
(Continued from previous Page)
Professor Abraham Maslow, in an important article, writes :"Those human impulses which
have seemed throughout our history to be deepest, to be most instinctive and unchangeable,
to be most widely spread throughout mankind, i. e., the impulse to hate, to be jealous, to be
hostile, to be greedy, to be egoistic and selfish, are now being discovered more and more
clearly to be acquired and not instinctive. They are almost certainly neurotic and sick
reactions to basic situations, more specifically to frustrations of our truly basis and
instinct-like needs and impulses."
Professor Gardner Murphy writes :"As we watch behaviour in early childhood, we no
longer assume that each individual will inevitably push himself ahead and crave every toy
or every attention he can get ; instead, we begin to ask if there is something in our society
that does not satisfy the child's needs and, therefore, makes it aggressive."
The fact seems to be that aggressiveness usually develops in the child as a result of
frustration, that is to say, the blocking of expected satisfaction. The infant expects to have
its needs satisfied ; if those needs are not satisfied it feels frustrated, and normally reacts
with aggressive behaviour. It is now coming to be understood that aggression is, in effect,
a technique or mode of compelling attention to, and satisfaction of, one's needs. (I believe
that the late Ian B. Suttie was the first to point this out in his important book, The Origins
01 Love and Hate, Kegan Paul, London, 1935.)
Such an interpretation of the meaning of aggressive behaviour in children puts a very
different complexion upon the manner of handling it than has been customary in the
past. Aggressive behaviour in all human being most frequently represents a response to
frustration. A response to the frustration of expected satisfaction.
As the result of the work of a large number of investigators it is now indisputably clear
that the satisfaction of the child's needs by the mother or some substitute for the mother
is necessary for the healthy physical and mental development of the person. Physical
satisfaction of the needs of the organism is not enough ; what is necessary in addition is the
warmth, the love of another being who is deeply interested in the welfare of the child.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the infant is born not only with the ne d to be
toved, but also with a need to love ; he is certainly not born with any need to be aggressive.
This view of human nature makes a very different picture from the troditional one
with its conception of man born with aggressiveness. It is that view which rendered rotion-
alizations about the"innate warlikeness"of man, and facile generalizations about man as
a"brute", the stock in trade of every former authority on human nature. But modern
research has shown that this view of human nature is erroneous. Man is not born evil or
aggressive-he is rendered so. This being the case, it is incumbent upon us to realize
that we can best change human nature for the better not by working on man's biological
inheritance but by working on his social inheritance ; by changing those conditions which
produce disharmony in the person and corresponding disharmony in his society. As Professor
Warder C. Allee has said :"Despite many known appearances to the contrary, human
altruistic drives are as firmly based on an animal ancestry as is man himself. Our tendencies
toward goodness, such as they are, are as innate as our tendencies toward intelligence ;
we could do well with more of both."
The school of evolutionary thought which preached the struggle for existence and the
survival of the fittest gave a one-sided view of nature as a competitive"red in tooth and
claw"process, and omitted almost entirely the factors of co-operation and mutual aid,
which play so great a role in the ecology, the balance, of nature. The resulting view of
nature was thus put badly out of focus, but upon it was erected a view of human nature
which was as readily accepted as was the evolutionary theory of nature modelled on a
laissezfaire industrial civilization.
Perhaps one of the most important of our conclusions is that never was there a
stereotype more unsound than that enshrined in the view ;"You can't change human
nature". On the contrary, we find that man is the most plastic, the most malleable, the
most educable, of all living crectures ; indeed, that educability is a species character of
Homo sapiens. Man is the learning animal, and he is capable of learning and changing
his views and his habits throughout his life.
Human nature, happily, is a great deal better in its promise than man has thus far
realized in his performance.'
