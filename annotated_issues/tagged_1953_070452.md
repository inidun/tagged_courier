FROM THE UNESCO NEWSROOM...
* Brazil : The rich and colourful re-
sources of popular Brazilian folklore in
music, the dance and handicrafts, which
have greatly contributed to the nation's
culture, figure largely in the programme
of the Second Brazilian Congress of
Folklore being held from 22 to 31 Au-
gust at Curitiba on the occasion of the
festivities commemorating the first cen-
tenary of the foundation of the province
of Parana. The Congress has been con-
vened by the Institute for Education,
Science and Culture (the Brazilian Na-
tional Commission of Unesco) and is
under the patronage of the Government
of the State.-
The programme includes the inaugur-
ation of an exhibition of folklorist pho-
tographs at the Folklore Museum in the
School of Music and Fine Arts, and the
placing of a commemorative plaque on
the house in Paranagua where Itibere
èa Cunha, the first Brazilian composer
to use a popular theme in the writing of
a major musical work, was born. There
are also lectures, film showings, sym-
phonic concerts, gramophone recitals
and presentations of ceramics and pop-
ular musical instruments.
* Unesco : Descartes'"Discourse on Me-
thod"has just been published in Arabic
for the first time, thanks to the work of
the International Commission for the
Translation of Great Works which oper-
ates under the auspices of Unesco. The
Arab text is accompanied by comment-
aries and explanatory notes. The Inter-
national Commission has already pro-
duced French translations of Avicen-
na's"The Book of the Directives and
Remarks" ;"The Book of the Misers"by
A ! Djahiz and translations into English,
French and Spanish of AI-GazaIi's book,
"0 Disciple."It is now working on
Arab translations of Aristotle's"Poli-
tics", Montesquieu's"L'Esprit des Lois",
and Cervantes'"Don Quixote."
* Iran : Thanks to Unesco, an estimat-
ed fifty thousand dollar's worth of optic-
al instruments needed by Iran's scien-
tists were put into working order over
the past sixteen months. The work was
done. by a young French optical engineer,
P. M. Larraburu, who went to Iran on
a Unesco Technical Assistance mission.
Working with local engineers, he repair-
ed and adjusted optical instruments
used in Iranian science faculties and
research laboratories.
* Norway : Radio sets to a value of
5 : 22, 500 ($63, 000) have been given by the
Norwegian Unesco Committee to schools
in Austria, Burma, Greece, Haiti, India,
Italy, Malaya, Pakistan, Poland and
Turkey. The sets were bought with
funds raised during a nation-wide ap-
peal on behalf of the United Nations
Children's Fund.
* Unesco : The International Workers'
Education Centre, founded last year by
Unesco at the Chateau de la Breviere
near Paris, has now opened for its se-
cond summer season. Unesco created
the Centre as a meeting-place where
experts in workers'education can ex-
change information and compare exper-
iences with teaching methods. The first
of this summer's two seminars, will
discuss problems of international under-
standing in workers'education and will
be directed by M. André Philip of
France. Later there is to be a second
international seminar, under the direc-
tion of Professor G. D. H. Cole of the
United Kingdom.
* Liberia : The first West African Se-
minar on teaching about the United
Nations and its Specialized Agencies re-
cently took place in Monrovia, Liberia.
The meeting was organized by the Unit-
ed Nations Association of Liberia and
the Liberian Government. Attending
were sixty-four delegates from seven
countries of West Africa : Liberia, Nige-
ria, Sierra Leone, East and West Togo-
land, the Cameroons and the Gold
Coast. One of the resolutions passed
requested Unesco to survey the possib-
ilities of establishing a Fundamental
Education Centre for West Africa. This
was requested, said the resolution, in
view of the success of fundamental educ-
ation projects in combatting problems
of illiteracy, poverty and disease.
favour of a study in each country of
the living standards of intellectual
workers as compared with those of other
professions and trades.
* Burma : A rural library service
developed over the last two years now
serves almost a million and a half peo-
ple in Burma, according to an announ-
cement from the Burmese Mass Educa-
tion Council. The Council hopes to
extend the work in the near future to
more of the population which numbers
some seventeen millions and is predom-
inantly agricultural. The Council
has helped establish a chain of village
reading rooms which it keeps supplied
through a new system of.. circulating
book-cases". In addition, audio-visual
Dr. LUTHER EVANS
ELECTED DIRECTOR-
GENERAL OF UNESCO
DR. Luther Harris Evans has been elected Direc-tor-General of Unesco for the next six years
by the General Conferem : e of Unesco which met in
extraordinary session in the first week of July. Dr.
John W. Taylor had served as Acting Director-Gener-
al since the resignation of Dr. Jaime Torres Bodet
during the Unesco General Conferem : e in Paris last
November and December.
Dr. Evans has been a member of the Unesco Exe.
cutive Board since 1949 and the Librarian of Con-
; ; ; êSS of the United States since 1945. He was
born in Bastrop County, Texas, on 13 October 1902. He holds the degrees of
Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts, University of Texas ; Doctor of Philosophy, Start-
ford University ; Doctor of Humane Letters, Yale University ; Doctor of Laws, Pennsyl-
vania Military College and British Columbia University ; Doctor of Laws (honorary)
Loyola University.
Dr. Evans was instructor at Stanford from 1924 to 1927 aryJ at New York Univers-
ity in 1927 and 1928. From 1928 to 1930 he was instructor in political science
at Dartmouth College, and from 1930 to 1935 assistant professor of politics at Prin-
ceton. In 1935, Dr. Evans was appointed Directar, Historical Records Survey, Works
Projects Administration, of the United States Government, a post which he held until
1939 when he joined the Library of Congress as Director of the Legislation Refer-
ence Service.
In 1945, Dr. Evans became associated with Unesco when he served as adviser to
the United States Delegation to the London Conference which created the Organiz-
ation ; and the next year he was appointed a member of the United States National
Commission for Unesco, of which he served as Vice-Chairman and Chairman. He has
attended all the sessions of Unesco's General Conference. Dr. Evans is a member of
the American Librarians Association, the American Political Science Association and
other professional orgonizations.
* United States of America : Tackling
the problem of storage space, the Na-
tural History Museum of Cincinnati has
found a practical way of utilizing sur-
plus materials that cannot be put in its
own show cases. The materials have
been divided into sets, and these are
now being sent to the public schools in
the region. The Museum has prepared
enough material from its surplus stocks
to supply each school with a different
monthly exhibit for the next five years.
* International : Leading officials of
the International Confederation of In-
tel1ectual Workers met recently at Unes-
co House in Paris. This organization,
founded thirty years ago, works in con-
junction with several national and in-
ternational bodies in the defense of cul-
ture and all forms of intellectual work.
At its meeting, the C. I. T. I. came out in
and book vans are touring the villages,
serving as forerunners of further educ-
ational efforts.
* United Kingdom : June seventh this
year marked the two hundredth anniv-
ersary of the world-famous British
Museum. Sir Hans Sloane, called"the
father of natural history"died in 1753
and placed his valuable private museum
at the disposal of the nation. A special
act of Parliament later that year
accepted the gift and created the nu-
cleus of to-day's British Museum. The
Museum was opened to the public in
1759. The aniversary was celebrated in
England and special programmes over
the BBC were devoted to the occasion.
* Japan : Japan has invited Unesco to
hold a regional seminar in Tokyo next
year on the role of arts and crafts in
Education. According to Unesco's Acting
Director-General, Unesco will accept
the invitation. The idea for such a
seminar was accepted by the Organiza-
tion's General Conference last year.
Sixteen countries will be invited to par-
ticipate in this meeting, and a number
of other countries will be asked to send
observers. The seminar is designed to
improve the teaching of art and the
popularization of the arts among adults.
* International : The International'
Labour Organization has found that
more people in the world live under
thatch roofs than under any other type.
This and many other facts came to light
at a conference in New Delhi that
discussed efforts being made by Asian
countries to provide low-cost housing
for their millions of workers. The ILO
survey noted that building research in
Asia is extremely important to-day, in
view of the tremendous need for hous-
ing. The report declared that research
and experimentation with new materials
and methods would lead to substantial
increases in building.
* International : World Health Day
next year will honour the famed
English hospital reformer Florence
Nightingale, alongwith the millions of
nurses now at work in the field of pub-
lic health. World Health Day is
celebrated each year on April 7, by the
eighty countries belonging to the World
Health Organization. The WHO's
decision to honour Florence Nightingale
follows a proposal recently submitted by
the Government of Uruguay and is in
recognition of the centenary of the
work which the famous nurse began.
* Iran : At ancient Shiraz, once the
capital of Iran, a model agricultural
school is now training teachers in up-
to-date farming methods with three
countries-Iran, France and the
United States-playing some part in
its development. Its head is a young
Iranian, Zain UI-Abdin Lashkari who
took over after benefitting from a
Unesco fellowship covering a year's
study of agricultural education in Fran-
ce. The school serves as an experiment-
al station to test adaptability of
crops to local conditions. During an
18-month mission Mr. Sydney Law, a
Unesco technical assistance expert,
worked with Iranian educational and
economic planning authorities in build-
ing up a national network of similar
agricultural schools, of which seven are
now in operation.
* International : A cultural agreement
between France and Japan has been
signed in Tokyo. It provides for the
further development of cultural rela-
tions between the two countries and for
the exchange of students and scholars.
Japanese students already have been
invited by the French government to
visit France, and the Franco-Japanese
House in Tokyo has just been re-opened.
* France : France's Information Centre
on Fundamental Education recently
organized a special exhibition in Paris
on"Fundamental Education and Adult
Education in the French Union, Tunisia
and Morocco."On display were exper-
iments now being carried on in these
countries to make health information
available to all, to improve housing and
agriculture, and to fight illiteracy.
The French Information Centre on
Fundamental Education was organized
with the co-operation of Unesco.

### 70308: A Man with racial prejudice is as pathetic as his victim

) COURIER AUGUST-SEPTEMBER 1953. Page 3
A MAN WITH RACIAL PREJU. DICE
IS AS PATHETIC AS HIS VICTIM
ONE might almost say of racial prejudice whatDescartes once said of common sense-that
it is the one thing in the world that prac-
tically everyone has a smattering of. The absence
of open discrimination by no means implies the
absence of false and injurious notions with regard
to other racial groups. And the fact is that the
number of individuals in our own civilization who
are prepared to consider all men their potential
equals and capable of the same progress, is
extremely limited.
For Unesco, therefore, the problem is a dual
one. It is not only that of fighting racialism as a
doctrine but also of combatting the root-ideas
which render the existence of such a doctrine
possible. In other words the real problem is to
break the naive, yet extremely powerful associ-
ation which continues to exist between the notions
of"culture"and"race",
Racialism will exist so long as the belief prevails
that the Negroes have a certain type of civilization
because they are black and have fuzzy hair, or
that the Chinese behave in a certain way because
they have slanting eyes and yellowish skin. So
long as people continue to speak in mystic mumbo-
jumbo terms of"racial temperament","the soul
of the people","racial instinct"and similar
expressions, racial prejudice will not even be close
to disappearing.
The advocates of racialism are forever citing
science as an"objective"basis for their ideas.
But whether they realize it or not their"objective"
basis is nothing more than plain intellectual
fraud since the scientific theories they advance
have been discarded by scientists a long time ago.
It is because the racialists have put the question
on the scientific level and lean iso. heavily on
science as their authority that the challenge must
be met by the scientist.
It has been argued that trying to overcome
racial prejudice with true scientific facts is a sheer
waste of time since race prejudice is based neither
on ignorance nor on any number of facts, but
rather on certain emotional attitudes. The roots
of racial prejudice, the argument continues, reach
by Dr. Alfred Metraux
deep deep down into the. subconscious where they
are nourished by anxieties caused by inward
suffering, anguish or worry of an economic or
social nature. Racial prejudice is, among other
things, one expression of the anxiety of man lost
in a mechanized society which no longer respect
his individual personality.
There is only one way we can hope to destroy
racial prejudice, this school of thought states, and
that is by transforming the economic conditions
of the environments it develops in, and taking
legislative action to prevent its abuses.
Does this mean, then, that Unesco is wasting
its time when it publishes a series of pamphlets in
which scientists of various nationalities sum up
present scientific knowledge about race ? I do not
think so. For can it be denied that the race
problem is indissolubly joined to the development
of scientific thought ? The clichés and pseudo-
anthropological theories which are used to justify
racial discrimination are a means of setting the
mind at ease by cloaking injustice with the dignity
of a system prescribed by science and reason.
If true men of science remained silent they
would be allowing the most fantastically false
ideas and the most naive myths to be transformed
into"true scientific facts". And this. science
cannot permit to happen. For if racialist propa-
ganda is. so successful-and the Nazis showed how
successful it could be-it would be folly to permit
it carte blanche.
Some reply, some form of action had to come
therefore from men of science. The very notion
of science is one of the guiding principles of our
civilization, one of its driving forces. Even those
who have falsified it and twisted it to suit their
political aims have recognized this and indirectly
paid tribute to science's role by their use of it-
distorted though it was.
The fact is that racialism has found scarcely
any support among anthropologists worthy of the
name, and with rare exceptions anthropologists
the world over have consistently repudiated
racialist doctrines. This, however, has never
prevented racialists from declaring unscientific
every statement which tended to establish the fact
that no evidence at present exists proving the
absolute superiority of one ethnic group or race
over another.
The role played by science in the racial question
was clearly shown by the repercussions caused by
the Uneseo"Statement on Race"drawn up in 1949
by a group of sociologists, anthropologists and
psychologists. Hailed by some as a prejudice-
breaking document, it was greeted by others as a
Utopian text with no bearing on present-day
realities.
So that there could be no doubt as to Unesco's
objectivity a second group of scientists composed
exclusively of physical anthropologists and gene-
ticists was called upon to re-examine the question.
This group drew up a second statement (1951) in
which, generally speaking, the main conclusions
of the first statement were upheld. The second
statement was published only after it had been
submitted to nearly one hundred scientists who
were asked to study it carefully and criticize it
freely. Their comments, both favourable and
unfavourable were published in the Unesco
booklet containing the text of the declaration,
and entitled"The Race Concept-Results of an
Inquiry".
A problem-to my mind a false one-which
obsesses many people today is that of the differ-
ences in mental aptitudes of the races of man-
kind. This is a point in the Declaration on which
anthropologists and geneticists have the most
difficulty in reaching agreement. First of all,
available scientific knowledge does not enable
us to determine how mental aptitudes are trans-
mitted and unlike blood groups which we have
now begun to isolate, science is still unable to iso-
late the genes which determine mental aptitudes.
Furthermore, it is difficult, in fact
practically impossible, to measure (cont'd on
the effect of environment on the de-
velopment of intelligence and mental next pare,)

SLAVERY. ENDED WHEN MEN
THOUGHT IT SHAMEFUL ; THE SAME

capacity. Even more serious is the
frequent failure to consider his-
torical factors when discussing
racial differences. People speak
of racial aptitudes as if they had
always been the same and never
changed. That is why I believe
that no statement in the Declar-
ation is more realistic than the
one which reminds us that"vast
social changes have occurred that
have not been connected in any
way with changes in racial type.
Historical and sociological stu-
dies thus support the view that
genetic differences are of little
significance in determining the
social and cultural differences
between different groups of men".
Racialism has taken on a
greater intensity at the very
moment when historical events
and scientific research emphatic-
ally repudiate it. Future histor-
ians may well regard the most
important and significant revol-
ution of our time to have been
that which is thrusting the col-
oured peoples into the orbit of
our modern civilization.
The rapid advance of the peo-
ples of all the world towards a
single material type of civilization
is a tremendous event, the far-
reaching consequences of which
are still hard to grasp. How can
the doctrines of racialism possibly
hold water when the races of the
world are setting such an exam-
ple of pliability and adaptability ?
1953 is not 1853
THESE factors which ought tostrike everyone who follows
world events, are just as
eloquent as, indeed even more elo-
quent than, all the scientific
conclusions put together, but such
is the force of habit that facts
and theories long since out of
date are still used by people in
judging races.
To consider Africa and its inha-
bitants in 1953 in the same way
as one did in 1853 is to display
unpardonable ignorance. The
awakening of Africa and the
formation before our very eyes of
a constantly growing native elite,
are things that the racialist
consciously or unconsciously
forgets or prefers to ignore.
One of the things Unesco has
set out to do is to study the
manner in which so many peoples
are effecting their transform-
ation from an ancient form of
civilization to our complex indus-
trialized way of life, and to
make this information widely
known. Of what value will be the
innumerable writings which seek
to prove that Negroes have no
capacity for certain kinds of
intellectual activities once Ne-
groes in constantly increasing
numbers have joined the ranks of
our writers, engineers, research
workers and statesmen ?
Negation of a myth
THE African who succeeds inwinning the highest distinc-
tions in the Humanities, as
happened recently in England,
has a double merit. First for
having triumphed in a stiff exam-
ination, second for having over-
come the numerous handicaps
which do not face European can-
didates. We all of us know the
effort required to adjust ourselves
to another form of culture even
when it is close to our own.
What then, must be the amount
of effort and intelligence call-
ed for in order to assimilate
a form of civilization based on a
social structure and a way of life
as different as that of Europe and
the traditional African. Is not
the intellectual effervescence
which is taking place today in
Africa and Asia and which in
(Continued from previous page.)
several African regions can be
seen in the rapid modernization
of institutions and of economic
life, the very negation of the
racial myth ?
Race relations, of course, are
not always marked by signs of
antagonism. Even in countries
where racialism is rife, the go-
vernment or groups of individuals
and organizations have attempt-
ed through varying measures to
improve contacts between races
and put a stop to abuses and
injustices. What was needed,
however, was that the effective-
ness of such measures be ap-
praised and the results carefully
studied.
Anti-racial laws
ONE of the basic questionsraised in the struggle against
racialism is :"What prac-
tical effect does legislation pun-
ishing any act of racial discrim-
ination as a crime really have ?"
Opponents of such legislation
have always maintained that
custom was stronger than law
and that racial prejudice could
not be broken by legal texts. The
experience of various American
States has shown quite clearly,
however, that anti-discrimination
laws have had beneficial results
even if they have not in them-
selves modified prejudices or basic
attitudes.
The policy of the assimilation
of different ethnic groups ha. s also
been highly successful in certain
countries such as Mexico where
great efforts have been made in
the past century to"integrate"
the large indigenous population.
The progress achieved by the
Negroes of the French West Indies
since they were freed from slavery
in 1849 would also deserve careful
study. From studies such as the
few just mentioned and others,
certain facts could emerge and
analogies be made which would
ultimately enable us to say. how
two groups separated by race and
civilization can blend and form a
single unit.
Race and religion
No civilization has ever hadcause to regret its action in
welcoming other peoples. It
has always been amply repaid for
its interest and generosity by the
contributions with which the
newcomers have enriched it.
Today, for example, many Negro
writers have enriched English
and Frenc. h literature and there
is every reason to believe that in
the not too distant future Negroes
will be participating to a still
greater degree than they do today
in scientific and cultural activi-
ties. Discrimination and racial
persecution wither and impov-
erish societies which seek to pre-
serve the myth proclaiming the
virtue of racial"purity".
Doctrines of racialism are not
only contrary to the present
findings of science but also scorn
the principles which are the foun-
dation stones of the world's great
religions and philosophies. A
world-wide attack on racialism
therefore cannot be won without
the help of religion. All univer-
salist religions are, by definition,
anti-racialist by the very fact
that they are addressed to all
mankind. Unfortunately, the
message of human brotherhood
embodied in their teaching is too
often ignored.
In the struggle against all forms
of racialism it is therefore useful
to recall the doctrines and texts
which proclaim the equality of
all men in the eyes of God and
which condemn the myth of race,
often in the severest terms, while
exalting the dignity and worth of
man whatever his physical traits
may be. The churches-the
word is used here in its very
broadest sense-are therefore
powerful allies in the struggle
against racial discrimination and
racial prejudice.
Unesco has therefore called
upon eminent representatives of
the world's great religious faiths
to present brief and simple
accounts of the position of their
churches regarding the racial
problem. These will soon appear
in a new series of books under the
general title"The Racial Problem
in Modern Thought", presenting
the Catholic, Protestant, Muslim,
Jewish and Buddhist point of view
as well as that of other great
religious faiths. The first books
to be published in this series have
been written by Father Yves Con-
gar, an eminent Roman Catholic
theologian of France and by W. A.
Visser't Hooft, General Secretary
of the World Council of Churches.
(On pages 8 and 9 of this issue
the Courier has published two
articles on Christianity and the
Racial Question, specially prepar-
ed by these religious authorities.
(See also Bibliography, page 18,)
Present-day fanaticism
THE texts published in theseforthcoming books and the
facts they will bring before
the public no doubt take on new
and profound significance in view
of the intolerance and fanaticism
so prevalent today. They are
aimed at touching the conscience
of men and at creating in the
minds of even the most pre-
judiced a feeling of uneasiness
and of doubt which is the first
step towards a change of attitude.
The efforts displayed today
against racialism have many
points in common with those
employed less than 150 years ago
in the fight against slavery. At
that time slavery, too, was con-
sidered an institution dictated by
the laws of nature and reason.
Today, we look upon the argu-
ments advanced against the abo-
lition of slavery as nothing more
than naive and we find it diffi-
cult to believe that in support of
this doctrine such heated discus-
sions and impassioned polemics
were unleashed. True, econ-
omic laws worked against slavery
but it would not. have been abol-
ished so quickly had public opin-
ion not come to look upon it
as a thing of shame. The same
is true of the fight against racial-
ism.
No longer respectable
A S the sociologist GunnarMyrdal has so well express-
ed it :"It is significant that
today even the white man who
defends discrimination frequently
describes his motive as'prejudice'
and says that it is'irrational'.
The popular beliefs rationalizing
caste in America are no longer
intellectually respectable. They
can no longer, therefore, be found
in current books, newspapers or
public speeches. They live a sur-
reptitious life in thoughts and
private remarks. There we have
had to hunt them when studying
the matter in this inquiry. When
they were thus drawn out into
the open they looked shabby and
ashamed of themselves. Every-
body who has acquired a higher
education knows that they are
wrong. Most white people with
a little education also have a
hunch that they are wrong.
There is today a queer feeling of
credo quia absurdum hovering
over the whole complex of pop-
ular beliefs sustaining racial dis-
crimination. This makes the
prejudiced white man nearly as
pathetic as his Negro victim."

### 70313: The Origins of races, still steeped in mystery

COURIER AUGUST-SEPTEMBER 1953, Page 5
THE ORIGINS OF RACES,
STILL STEEPED IN MYSTERY
by W. W. HO WELLS
Professor of Anthropology,
University of Wisconsin
A GREAT deal has been learned about the
past of man since Darwin made the
docirine of evolution irresistible (if not
at once respectable), and Huxley so
forcefully pointed out its meaning to ourselves
by showing our intimate relationship with the :
great anthropoid apes. It is the most recent
discoveries of the South African man-apes by
Dart, Broom and Robinson, which have given
us the clearest light on our adual human
origins, and in fact have made these origins
seem more log'ical, so to speak, than ever.
Matters had been different before. It had not
been easy to fit the known facts together. It was
clear how close men and apes were, these largu
tailless animals being quite distinct from mon-
keys, and sharing even such things as patterns
of the teeth. But while our torso was like their's.
our pelvis, legs and feet were different, being
meant for true upright walking, not for bough-
clasping ; and our canine teeth were short and
small.
One after another fossils were found in Eur-
ope, Africa and Asia, some of them of small.
early apes something like the living gibbon,
and others larger and later, claarly akin
to the orang, chimpanzee and gorilla. If
these were our own ancestors, they were
certainly ape-tike. This left us the rather
uncomfortable theory that man was a late
comer, an ape who had for some reason come
out of the trees to a permanent ground life,
undergoing rapid changes in feet and canine
teeth as a response to this drastic shift (and
later developing a large brain).
The explanation bristled with difficulties :
Why had the shift occurred? ? How could the
fool have reformed its toes and made an arch !
Why were there not clearer signs of once-hugs
canine teeth ? Yet the most likely parents
known from fossils (Dryopithecus and his
relatives) were certainly apes much like the
ones we know today, and so this explanation
held, faute de mieux.
Then, mostly'within the last six years, a
group of closely related fossil animals of great
importance came to light in South Africa, in
limestone deposits which had once been caves.
The oldest finds, of teeth and of skull fragments.
simply showed certain human traits. But
excitement mounted as later and better
specimens revealed that, though large of jaw,
they had the relatively small cHnines and front
teeth of true men, so different from a gorilla's ;
and that their small-brained heads nevertheless
had the human type of a number of minor
details of construction, and not the type found
in apes.
Finally, several hip bones capped the climax
by making it clear that these man-apes were
true upright ground-walkers like ourselves.
That is to say, they can only be considered as
very primitive and small-brained men, be-
longing to our side of the family, not the
gorilla's. This in turn shows that our side--
the ground-walking side-probably had a long-
and honourable history of its own, separate
from the tree-loving apes we know, and that
we no longer have to suppose, as once we did,
that these tree apes wee the only kind of
ancestor possible to us.
Oldest 'human' fossil
These riches in fossils are all from SouthAfrica, but it now seems, from some other
rare finds, as though the same general
kind of animal also lived in East Africa, in
China, and in Java-in many parts of the Old
World - during the late Tertiary and early Ice
Age, at the same time that later kinds of men
were appearing, and probably also earlier.
More such fossils will surely be found in other
places. In the meanwhile, we have learned a
great deal about the details of these ancient
forms, and have done away with much of the
mystery of our own beginnings.
So much for the origins of man. The origins
of races, unfortunately, although far later, are
steeped as much in mystery as ever. We know
very well that there were different kinds of
early men during the time of the Ice Age. The
ancient, thick-skulled Java Man is famous, and
so is his slightly more advanced cousin, the
Pekin Man. The Heidelberg jaw, in Europe.
may be the oldest"human"fossil of all (after
the man-apes). Alas, that so little can be told
from a jaw.
Later, more advanced kinds of men are
known from Africa-the Rhodesian Man--
and from Europe, which was part of the pro-
vince of the Neanderthaters, who furnish us
with a special mystery in their peculiar bowed
and thick boned Hmbs-aU the other fossil
men had skeletons tike our own. Then in the
latest part of the lee Age the board was swept
clean of all such types, and was suddenly
occupied by modern man alone.
This was the time of the cave men (the Cro
Magnons and others), who painted, in due
course, the masterpieces in the caves of Lascaux
and Altamira. These are our ancestors, our
own kind, with a high skull and a delicate face
of a kind not seen in the other fossil men.
These ancestors appeared not only in Europe,
but apparently also as the parents of other races
in other places : in China (as a sort of parental
American Indian), and perhaps even in Aus-
tralia.
Well and good ; but here is a mystery.
Where did these related kinds of"modern"
men come from ? Why did they appear so late,
and apparently suddenly ? Who are their an-
cestors ? And what made them into races ?
Tliis matter is one of the great problems of
anthropology, and it contains in itself a key to
our understanding of race.
The late Dr. Franz Weidenreich, renowned
anatomist and palaeontologist, thought the
answers were alreadv in the museums : that
the older and different types of men known
from the Ice Age, each in its own part of the
word, had gone forward in evolution until each
had achieved the status of modern man,
"Homo sapiens"proper, though each in a
different racial form.
He found certain likenesses in each case, he
thought, as for example between the Pekin men
and the modern Mongoloid peoples. But his
theory involves a biological improbability. The
earlier men were of rather distinct types, and
the races of modern man are all one type,
certainly very similar in their skulls and
skeletons to one another.
His theory would therefore suppose that evo-
lulion had taken diverse types and made them
all-not just two or a few - into a single type.
Evolution has done this to no other animal form,
and there are serious reasons as to why
it is not likely to happen. This idea of
Weidenreich's would see modern races as much
more separate in their origins than the more
generally held belief, that they arose as lesser
variations on a single theme.
Though we need-not accept Weidenreich's
view, we do not know what is the right
one. We know far too little about the
biological nature of racial differences : the
meaning of skin colours and hair forms, and
so on. It is no simple matter of becoming
black under the sun of Africa, though such
forces have probably partaken in the results.
But this is not all we do not know. We lack
the skeletal evidence to show how old modern
man is, or where he might have developed.
The past is almost a blank
The important Fontéchevade skull, found by. MIle Henri-Martin, at least tells us that our
kind of man (or something very like it)
existed in France in the Third Interglacial
period, and so was as old as the Neanderthal
men. But this is little to go on. From the
advent of the Cro Magnons, we know that
Europe was continuously peopled with"White"
men, wherever they may have come from. But
elsewhere our knowledge is almost all gaps.
We are relatively certain that the American
Indians wandered over from Asia, a good deal
later, in much their present form. But the past
of the Mongoloids, and above all the Negroes, is
practically a blank. We can only look at their
distributions and make guesses.
One is strongly inclined to feel that the
common parent stock of races is fairly, but not
very, old : and that its most ancient division was
into a dark-skinned tropical branch on one
hand, and on the other a medium-skinned
northern branch not unlike American Indians.
Also that in turn, one stem of this second
branch went to America, another became
lighter in colour and straighter of face and
headed for Europe, and a third became
drastically modified in facial form as a pro-
tection against the savage Siberian cold, and
produced the slit-eyed, flesh-padded face of the
lungoloid peoples of the north.
But please be sure that these are stimates.
Some day we shall have enough ancient
skeletons to tell us more. Probablv the blood
types of living people will help, though they
often provide as much confusion as light. And
archaeology, tracing the steps of different
tribes through their ancient dwellings, may at
least show us what is likely to have happened,
and what is not.

### 70314: The Racial heritage of H.M.S. Bounty: two different peoples, now one family

Page 6. AUGUST-SEPTEMBER 1953
THE RACIAL HERITAGE OF'H. M. S. BOUNTY
TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLES-NOW ONE FAMILY
PERHAPS the most widely knownof all cases of race mixture is
the small group of Polynesian-
English mixed bloods that live on
Pitcairn Island in the South Pacific.
Here on a tiny volcanic island only
about two miles long and about half
as wide were resolved the train of
events that the famous mutiny of
the Bounty set in action.
This episode, famous in British
naval annals, occurred in the year
1789 shortly after.'H. M. S. Bounty"
had departed from Tahiti where she
had been dispatched under the
command of Lt. William Bligh to
collect bread fruit plants. Reports
brought back to Europe by Cook and
Bougainville described the bread
fruit as a remarkable tree capable of
supplying a staple article of food
with a minimum of effort.
British planters in the West Indies,
eager to obtain so easy a source of
foodstuff for their slaves, had
petitioned for the expedition with
by Dr. Horry L. Shapiro.
which Bligh had been entrusted.
Now after six successful months in
Tahiti, with the ship's hold full of
potted trees, the return trip was in-
terrupted by the mutiny of twenty-
five of the men out of the crew of
forty-four. The mutineers were led
by Fletcher Christian, one of Bligh's
officers, and a native of the Isle of
Man where his family had long been
prominent.
The mutineers seizing the ship, put
Bligh and those faithful to him
adrift in a small open boat and reset
the Bounty's course for Tubuai, an
island 300 miles south of Tahiti.
Here an abortive attempt was made
to establish a settlement, which
failed because of the hostility
aroused in the natives by the
behaviour of the mutineers. Re-
turning after this to Tahiti, the
mutineers now split into two groups :
one, consisting of sixteen men,
preferred to remain in Tahiti where
a number of them had already
established liaisons with native
women and had been welcomed into
the island homes ; the other con-
tained nine men headed by Chris-
tian. These men, apparently an-
ticipating a possible punitive ex-
pedition once the news of the mutiny
reached England, were eager to
leave Tahiti where they could not
hope to escape capture and to find a
more remote land perhaps in-
accessible island where they might
remain undetected.
Accordingly they, together with
twelve Tahitian women and six
Tahitian men, set sail from Tahiti
in September 1789 and until 1808
were virtually lost to the world. In
the latter year their retreat on
Pitcairn, some 2, 500 miles southeast
of Tahiti, was discovered by Captain
Meyhew Folger.
During this interval much had
happened on the island. All the
Tahitian men and all but one of the
Englishmen had died-most of them
violently and after only a short
sojourn in their new home. In
addition, Folger found eight or nine
surviving Tahitian women and
twenty-five children, offspring of six
of the Englishmen and their native
wives. None of the Tahitian men
had left issue, perhaps because they
were murdered too soon after the
settlement on the island.
. From this handful of children, half
Polynesian half English, the little
colony increased by leaps and bounds
until fifty years later there were
almost 200 inhabitants on the island.
By this time fear of over-population
and the recurrence of water
shortages induced them to request of
the British Government the use of
Norfolk Island, some 4, 000 miles to
the west, as a new home. This
considerably larger island had re-
cently been abandoned as a penal

colony and was temporarily un-
occupied.
In 1856 the entire colony moved
there and set up a new estab-
lishment, but subsequently several
families returned to their beloved
Pitcairn. In 1864 there were 45
descendants of the mutineers living
on Pitcairn, the remainder having
continued on Norfolk. At present
there are on both islands about 1, 000
descendants of the original colony,
not counting those who have
married out of the community or
settled in New Zealand, Australia,
and elsewhere.
An unusual mixture
As an example of race mixturethe Pitcairn Islanders are far
from typical. But it is the
very singularity of the colony that is
full of meaning in interpreting race
mixture as we commonly see it. Sim-
ply as a cross between Polynesians
and English they can be matched in
many parts of Polynesia where the
same kind of mingling has occurred,
often with notable results as in New
Zealand. But unlike all other
mixtures of this kind in Oceania, and
indeed unlike virtually all race
mixture wherever it occurs (1), the
Pitcairn Islanders have lived and
developed their common life
completely separated from the
societies from which they were
originally derived.
Now it is an almost universal
consequence of race mixture that the
mixed bloods live in contact with the
parental groups and in one or the
other of the parental societies.
Since social status works both ways,
the association of a mixed group
with one of its parental societies can
be a decisive influence on its
development. Where mixed bloods
suffer legal disability, economic in-
justice or social prejudice, they are
victims of the attitudes well or ill-
founded, of the dominant element in
their society. The effects such as
resentment or antagonism upon the
mixed group in turn reinforce the
attitudes that provoke them.
It is because of all this that the
Pitcairn Islanders'complete separa-
tion from and independence of all
other societies assume added im-
portance, for here the entire com-
munity was of the same mixed
origin, was free of any social
structuring imposed upon them by a
larger society and escaped the in-
fluences that prejudice subtly works
upon its object. This, then, is a
community where social prejudice, at
least, is not a factor to be considered
and where we can study the con-
sequences of race mixture divorced
from the concomitant effects that
being a part of a larger group might
impose.
The last mutineer
ON the other hand, in any con-sideration of the colony, its
very isolation must be kept in
mind as it must be in appraising any
small community remote from the
world and cut off from the intellec-
tual and material stimuli of a larger
society. For the first eighteen years
of its existence, the Pitcairn colony
remained unvisited by any ship. The
children growing up in the first
generation of the community had
m ver seen anyone not a member of
their little family, for the early
colony lived as one extended family
with John Adams, the surviving
mutineer, as their pater familias.
Even after 1808 when their
existence became known, callers were
rare and their visits very brief. Not
until the 1820's did ships begin to
call at Pitcairn to obtain water and
fresh food. As American whaling
became increasingly active in the
Pacific these visits increased in
number, reaching their highest
frequency in the 1840's.
With the decline of whaling, Pit-
cairn once more reverted to its
former loneliness. These contacts,
although important in bringing to
the islanders the goods of the outside
world for which they had acquired
a taste, were brief and had little or
no influence on the social structure
of the colony.
It would, of course, be futile to
attempt to rate Pitcairn against
other communities mixed or other-
wise. There are too many variables
impossible to standardize that would
have to be taken into account. But
it is evident to anyone visiting the
island that here is a well-organized
settlement, conducting its own
affairs successfully under a system
devised by the islanders themselves.
Like people anywhere of course they
vary, but the visitor is invariably
impressed by the pleasant, friendly
manners of the islanders, their
charm, their hospitality and self
confidence. There is no trace here
of a people conscious of inferiority.
Remarkable in so small a commun-
ity, especially one cut off from the
developments of the outside world,
striking way illustrates the decisive
roles that sex and environment may
play in creating a new society. The
cultural resources available to the
new colony were, of course, English
and Tahitian. But it is obvious on re-
flection that not all the content of
either of these cultures could or
would be drawn upon since one cul-
ture, the English, was accessible only
through men who were sailors by
occupation, and the other, the Tahi-
tian, was represented by women who
were familiar with the crafts and
skills traditionally exercised in Ta-
hiti by their sex.
In addition to this, the colony on*
Pitcairn faced an environment unlike
the seats of either people, and in
transplanting their traditional ways
both the Tahitian women and the
English sailors found themselves
without the usual technical equip-
ment needed to practice whatever
skills and arts they knew. Even
such a basic and necessary object as
a nail was not available, not to
terials and hampered by the lack of
tools.
We find them as a consequence
building houses ingeniously put
together, the frame mortised, the
walls constructed of roughly hewn
planks fitted into slotted uprights,
the interiors provided with bunks
as in a ship's cabin. The roof,
however, was thatched in the Tahi-
tian manner since roof thatching is
prepared in Tahiti by the women
and this was a contribution the
Tahitian women on Pitcairn could
make to this novel house.
One of the common allegations
made about race mixture is that it
produces inferior human beings.
This belief is stated in various ways
that all come to the same thing :
mixed bloods combine the worst
features of both parental groups,
they are inferior to both stocks, or,
at best, they are intermediate and
therefore a debasement of the su-
perior group. This kind of state-
ment is put forth with respect to the
Led by Fletcher Christian, nine of the mutineers of the"Bounty"together with some Tahitian men and women sailed 2, 500
miles across the South Pacific to seek a hiding place. They found it on Pitcairn, a tiny volcanic island, about two miles long

me is Tristan da Cunha where a community

isolation for well over 100 years.
are some of the social institutions
which were established on Pitcairn
and maintained there ever since.
A democratic rule developed early
with all men and women enjoying
equal political rights, long before
political rights were granted women
in the Western World and indeed
before they were even very seriously
discussed there. Education was from
the first recognized as a necessity
and as the local institutions took
form, all children were required to
attend school until their sixteenth
year. The various families on the
island were taxed for the mainten-
ance of the school. Teachers were
selected from the students and
supported by the revenue levied on
the people. Here, too, the Pitcairn
Islanders were in advance of educ-
ational developments in greater cen-
tres of civilization.
The culture that emerged on
Pitcairn also reflected the mixed
origin of the colony and in a rather
mention a variety of common tools
that could not be fashioned on
Pitcairn.
Thus we find tata cloth univers-
ally used by the colony in its early
days. The making of this bark
cloth is traditionally a woman's job
in Tahiti and could be carried to
Pitcairn intact. Similarly, cooking
being a woman's concern, the Tahi-
tian technique of an underground
oven was standard on Pitcairn.
House building, on the contrary,
was the result of a complex of in-
fluences. The Tahitian style of
house would have been unsuitable in
the colder climate of Pitcairn, but in
any event it probably could not have
been built by the women who in
Tahiti leave the framing of a house
to the men. The Englishmen, prob-
ably only as adept in carpentry as
sailors of those days might be
expected to be, were handicapped
by the lack of essential building ma-
psychological (intellectual), moral
and biological characteristics of the
hybrids.
For the most part, the evidence
for this belief is strained through a
subjective sieve and rarely takes
account of the effect upon the
hybrid of his social, psychological
and economic position in the society
whose more favoured strains are
compared with him. But more
fundamental is the lack of reliable
measures for many of the qualities
in which the mixed blood is supposed
to be deficient.
As far as the Pitcairn Islanders
are concerned, I can offer no objec-
tive data on their psychological or
moral qualities. None to my know-
ledge is available. Certainly there
have been many published appraisals
of these traits of the islanders and
most of them are enthusiastic.

### 70317: Racialism implies a denial of God, for there can be no God if He is not the Father of all'

Page 8, AUGUST-SEPTEMBER 1953 UNESCO
THE CHRISTIAN ATTITUDE TOWARDS RACE
THE Church's attitude towards the racial question is
clearly indicated in the story of Whitsun. This festival.
as Christians well know, celebrates the birth of the
Church and the revelation of its mystery to the world. Let
us reread the story, as we find it in Acts II, 5, 7-11 :
"And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men,
out of every nation under heaven... And they were all amazed
and marvelled, saying...... how hear we every man in our own
tongue, wherein we were born ? Parthians, and Medes, and
Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea,
and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia. Phrygia, and Pam-
phylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and
strangers of Rome... Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them
speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God..."
This passage contains both a certain affirmation and a
negation of the racial concept-two contrasting ideas which,
however, are reconciled in the Church. For the Church
recognizes race for what it is, and at the same time goes
beyond it.
To begin with, race is accepted as a fact, and as a fact
which the Church regards as providential. That is why the
first chapters of Genesis, where the Bible serves as the mouth-
piece of God in setting forth those great realities of the
universe which we cannot help seeing and experiencing, men-
tion the multiplicity of races and languages, giving the
genealogies of the sons of Noah and describing the dispersion
which followed the episode of the Tower of Babel.
Few pure races exist
THE Church regards the variety of races (but not theirA antagonism) as something willed by God, and therefore
as something providential. For mankind, made in God's
image, has potentialities which can find an outlet only in the
various different ways in which the creation is conceived and
expressed. This is true, in the first place, as regards man's
temporal work on earth and, it may be said, as regards
history. And it is even true of the Church, whose unity is
not narrowness, but comprehensiveness. That is why the
Apocatypse, the last book'of Revelations, says of the New
Jerusalem that"they sholl bring the glory and honour of the
nations in it."
The"notions", both the sacred books say. When we
speak of"races", we are using 0 word which belong neither
to Biblical or liturgical terminology, nor to canon law or
theology ; all these prefer the term peoples. The word
o'Racialism implies a
denial of God, for there
can be no God if He is
not the Father of a) !
By Father Yves CONGAR
"race"indicates a homogeneous group of people having
certain genetically determined physical, psychological and
moral features in common. Christianity does not deny the
possibility of such groups ; whether they exist or not is a
matter for science to determine, and if science confirms their
existence Christianity cannot but admit it. But science also
tells us, and the Church is well aware, that in the course of
generations the human melting-pot has been so active that
few pure races are now to be found.
The genetic factor has been by no means alone in forming
the peoples of today ; other factors have been, for example,
similarity of climate, culture, food, way of life, education,
customs, and history. We are confronted not so much by
races as by peoples ; not so much by unadulterated biological
and genetic facts as by"human"facts, impregnated with
human history. It is not only birth, but upbringing, that
makes a man ; he is"brought into the world", in the real
sense, not when he leaves his mother's womb but when educa-
tion has drawn him into the culture of a particular country
and into the life of 0 particular group of human beings with
their own historical background.
People are thus divided among groups which are not all at
the same level of culture, or at any rate of civilization, if we
admit the distinction, traditionally accepted in Germany,
between Culture (Kultur) and Civilization. The first of these
terms denotes the style of life of a given community (that of
the men sometimes known as'''savages''is not necessarily
inferior to our own ; it is suited to the conditions in which
they live, and often reflects a remarkable degree of adaptation
to those conditions). The second means the whole body of
external resources tending to ensure a high standard of com-
fort, knowledge and technical skill.
The Church recognizes these historical inequalities,'t is
not resigned to every'aspect of them. From the outset it has
striven to raise the various peoples to a higher level of human-
ity by emancipating women and children ; by teaching men
how to work, read, write, practise justice and respect the
lives of others ; by founding hospitals and orphanages and so
on. Yet it makes realistic allowance for differences of culture
and civilization. For this reason, the Church's very firm stand
on behalf of unity and equality does not necessarily imply that
everything should be mixed up and reduced to one dead level,
or that all men should be subject to exactly the same rules.
We are not expected to have all things in common with those
whose standard of education, hygiene and manners is lower
than that of the group to which we ourselves belong.
But it will be seen that, in whatever measure it may be
justified, discrimination must not be based on colour or on
racial prejudice. It can stem only from historical and cultural
facts ; it relates not to the"'race"but to the"people"
concerned. Furthermore, respect for the rules that guide each
man's life, and for the customs of his country, is a very
practical form of respect for his human status in itself.
And in saying this-in the very act of affirming the exist-
ence of differences-we find ourselves confronted by that
affirmation of unity which is perhaps the most definite and
energetic pronouncement ever made by Christianity with regard
to the racial question.
Basic equality of all
FOR in the first place, it affirms the unity of the humanspecies, beyond and above all differences. That is the
meaning of the well-know story of the creation of Adam,
and of Eve from Adam-a theological affirmation not to be
invalidated by any attempt on the part of palaeontologists or
anthropologists to impose the theory of polygenism, in the
unlikely event of such a theory being one day favoured by
science. Mankind is a single family, and that fact carries
decisive implications.
It implies the basic equality of all men, in dignity as in
nature. It implies an underlying community of destiny or
vocation, regardless of individual historical destinies. it
implies the genuine capacity of all men to attain to civilization
and its benefits. Not all are at the same level, but all are
capable of rising to the greatest heights. Since all men and
all peoples are associated in an enterprise of humanity that
is of essential interest to each of them, the most advanced
have a certain duty to help the others forward.
Another decisive implication is the rejection of discrimination
based on racial arguments-discrimination whose various
forms, combined and placed at the service of some virulent
nationalist theory, go to make up racialism. Racialism strikes
at the very heart of Christianity, for it destroys that respect and
consideration for'''others''without which charity-the core
of Christianity-cannot exist. Moreover, it denies that God
is the Father of all men, since it refuses to recognize certain
of His children as brothers. In effect, it proscribes the saying
of"Our Father", the Lord's own prayer. It really implies a
denial of God, for there can be no God if He is not the Father
of all. Racialism implies atheism, and its various more or less
pantheistic statements about"Destiny"or even"Providence"
are powerless to conceal that fact..
The Catholic Church has therefore opposed racialism
wherever is has met with it. Such opposition has some-
times lacked the full measure of vigour required, because
Christians and churchmen do not always posses a discernment
and strength of character measuring up to their principles.
But it has been very effective, and often decisive. It is
noteworthy that the Papacy's first anti-racist pronouncement
was made at the very time when the first colonists were
claiming the right to enslave human beings, and confiscate
their property, on the pretext that they were inferior beings :
see Paul H's Bulls referring to Spanish colonization, of May
and June 1537 (quoted in my booklet The Catholic Church and
the Race Question). And it is known-or rather, not well
enough known-how outspokenly the contemporary Papacy
resisted the Nazi race policy and its frenzied anti-Semitism
("Spiritually, we are Semites"said Pius XI).
Colour of no significance
\V/HEN the race question presents itself in the naked andbrutal fo m of a race theory such as Hitlerism, the
Christian attitude is comparatively easy to decide, and
comparatively simple. But this ceases to be so when racialism
is engendered by a complex situation to which historical, cul-
tural, economic, political and even psychological factors have
contributed. A simple reaction may fail to allow for certain
important considerations, not all of them unworthy, and may
thus fall short of what is required. We have the example of
certain very concrete problems that have arisen in South
Africa, and of the very subtle, though sufficiently clear
statements made by the Catholic Bishops in that country in
May and September 1952 (cf. the booklet already mentioned).
Within the Church itself, matters are, once more, simpler.
St. Paul tells us that"there is neither Jew nor Greek, there
is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female ;
for ye are all one in Christ Jesus" (Galatians III, 28). That
is true. How many examples might be mentioned here ! It is
perhaps rash ( ?) to disobey the regulations concerning railway
compartments at Cape Town or Pretoria, but there is no
difficulty in a Negro kneeling beside a white man at the
Lord's Table, or in a coloured Bishop ordaining European
priests.
The Church, as we have seen, accepts the fact of race and
regards it as providential ; but the Church itself is above race.
Its essential existence takes place at a deeper revel, where
questions of colour, or even of culture, lose their significance.
The event which marked the day of Pentecost is constantly
being repeated, in different ways, in the life of the Church.
For instance, on 29 October 1939, at the beginning of the last
world war, His Holiness Pius XII, to demonstrate the unity of
the Church transcending frontiers and nationalities, conse-
crated twelve Bishops in St. Peter's in Rome-a Chinese, a
French foreign missionary, an Indian Jesuit, a Mexican Satesian,
an Italian Dominican, a Dutch Father of the S. Y. D. (Steyl),
an American, an Irishman, a German Franciscan, a White
Father from Belgium, a Madagascan and a Congolese.
This simple fact gives a clear indication of the Catholic
Church's attitude towards the racial question.

### 70319: To worship, live and work together regardless of race - these truly human relationships are the only normal ones'

T COURTIER AUGUST-SEPTEMBER 1953. Page 9
a IT 0 worship, live and work together regardless
of race-these truly human relationships are the
only norma ones'
by W. A. WSSER'T HOOFT,
General Secretary, World Council of Churches.
ONE of the remarkable facts of the twentieth century has
been the coming together of the Protestant, Anglican
and Orthodox Churches in what we know as the"Ecu-
menical Movement". This movement took more definite
form in 1948 when at Amsterdam delegates from some 150
churches in more than 40 countries agreed to establish the
World Council of Churches.
The Ecumenical Movement has been concerned not only
with the life of the churches as such, but also with the
message that the church has for the world. Since the question
of race is one which is crucial for the church itself and which
is of utmost importance for the life of the world, it is natural
that this co-operative venture of the churches should be
concerned with it.
One of the forerunners of the World Council was the'''Life
and Work"movement. Its Conference, held in Oxford in
1937, issued a strong statement on the racial question which
had a profound effect on the thinking of various churches.
It first recognized that"`the Christian sees distinctions of race
as part of God's purpose to enrich mankind with a diversity of
gifts".
Knowing that many people in the world, however, were using
these distinctions of race as an excuse for the oppression of
one group by another, the Conference declared :"Against
racial pride or race antagonism the church must set its face
implacably as rebellion against God."Frankly admitting
that the churches themselves were often guilty of erecting
walls of separation in their own life the Conference further
stated :"specially in its (the church's) own life and worship
there can be no place for barriers because of race or colours.....
no place for exclusion or segregation because of race or
colour."The World Council of Churches which after 1948
incorporated the"Life and Work"Movement continued to
adhere to the convictions expressed by the Oxford Confe-
rence.
The Assembly at Amsterdam considered the question of race
in two particular respects. First, it pointed out that the
Church can hardly hope that society at large will listen to its
pronouncements while it is guilty of fostering racial separation
in its own life.
That the Church must become aware of its own failure in
this respect was made abundantly clear in the report of the
Assembly's section on The Church and the Disorder of Society
which was unanimously received by the Assembly itself and
commended to the Churches.
This Assembly report declared :"It is here (in the matter
of racial distinction) that the Church has failed most
lamentably, where it has reflected and then by its
example sanctified the racial prejudice that is rampant in
the world. And yet it is here that today its guidance con-
cerning what God wills for it is especially clear. It knows that
it must call society away from prejudice based upon race or
colour and from practices of discrimination and segregation
as denials of justice and human dignity, but it cannot say a
convincing word to society unless it takes steps to eliminate
these practices from the Christian community, because they
contradict all that it believes about God's love for all His
children."
The Amsterdam Assembly further acknowledged the Church's
responsibility to work for the universal recognition of human
rights. Its section on The Church and the International
Disorder said :"We are profoundly concerned by evidence
from many parts of the world of flagrant violations of human
rights. Both individuals and groups are subjected to persecu-
tion and discrimination on grounds of race, colour, religion,
culture or political conviction. Against such actions whether
of governments, officials, or the general public, the churches
must take a firm and vigorous stand, through international
institutions of legal order. They must work for an ever wider
and deeper understanding of what are the essential human
rights if men are to be free to do the will of God."
In the period following the Amsterdam Assembly the World
Council of Churches'teadership has been continually concerned
with the racial situation in the world and especially with the
developments in South Africa. The Central Committee of
the World Council, meeting in Toronto, Canada in 1950,
particularly concerned itself with this point. It recommended
that an inter-racial ecumenical delegation be sent to visit the
South African Churches. It became apparent, however, that
such a delegation would not be generally welcomed and the
Central Committee could not agree to send a delegation of
any other nature. The General Secretary, however, made a
visit to the Union of South Africa in 1952, visiting both
English-and Africaans-speaking churches as well as various
African Negro bodies.
All racial divisions overcome
HE report which the General Secretary made on his visit
to the meeting of the Central Committee in Lucknow,
India, in January 1953, prompted a series of resolutions
from that body which said in part :
"The Central Committee gives encouragement to all those
in South Africa and elsewhere who are labouring for a solution
of the racial problem in keeping with the Christian Gospel,
and calls upon all Christians to uphold them in thought,
prayer and acts of reconciliation.
"The Central Committee would use this opportunity to
express its strong conviction that the first and foremost
contribution which the Churches everywhere can and must
make to the solution of the race problem is to manifest in
their own life that in Christ all racial division is overcome and
that any policy of enforced segregation in any aspects of
church life is incompatible with the very nature of the Church
in Christ.
"The Central Committee holding strongly the convictions
expressed by the First Assembly (Amsterdam), affirms that
all political, social and economic discrimination based on the
grounds of race, wherever they may exist, are contrary to the
Will of God as expressed in the Christian Gospel. Recognizing
that existing racial discriminations are increasing tension and
bitterness in various parts of the world, the Committee calls
upon the member churches to engage in the Christian
ministry of reconciliation and to do all in their power to end
such discrimination wherever it exists."
In August 1954 the second Assembly of the World Council
of Churches will be held at Evanston, Illinois, U. S. A. After
considering its main theme :"Christ-The Hope of the
World,"the Assembly will turn to six specific areas in which
this hope is relevant. One of these will be the realm of
inter-group relations :"the Church Amid Racial and Ethnic
Tensions."It is hoped that the work of this Assembly section
will serve to give more specific content to the convictions
already expressed by the various World Council bodies on the
race problem.
On the national level, the Ecumenical Movement has taken
the form of National Councils of Churches, and these have
often spoken on the race problem as it particularly affects
their own countries. Two cases are specially noteworthy.
"The General Board of the National Council of the
Churches of Christ in the U. S. A. in June 1952, adopted an
Official Statement and Resolution entitled :"The Church and
Segregation."Since the U. S. A. is, one of those areas in the
world where racial barriers are most in evidence, it is signi-
ficant that this body, representing the vast majority of Pro-
testant and Orthodox Christians in that country should
"renounce and earnestly recommend to its member churches
that they renounce the pattern of segregation based on race,
colour or national origin. as unnecessary, undesirable and A
violation of the Gospel of love and human brotherhood."
Common loyalty brings community
Ion a further elaboration of that theme, in words that have
also been adopted as their own by several of the official
church bodies, the National Council promised to work for
"a non-segregated church and a non-segregated community."
In Great Britain the British Council of Churches has realized
its particular responsibility toward all races represented in
the British Commonwealth. Consequently this ecumenical
body included as its fifth point in a seven-point policy which
it adopted in April 1951 :"To oppose racial discrimination
wherever it is found, at home and overseas ; in particular to
support and apply the principle of partnership in all relation-
ships, official and personal, with other members of the multi-
racial Commonwealth to which we belong."
Further implementing this policy, the British Council of
Churches in April 1953, adopted a resolution with specific
reference to the proposed Central Africa Federation, which
without committing the Council for or against the scheme
urged that safeguards be included to secure equal educational
opportunity for all racial groups, the removal of racial restric-
tions for skilled employment and the professions and the reduc-
tion of all discriminatory practices.
The common voice of the Churches as expressed through
the ecumenical bodies is clear. Friends of the Church as
well as its critics may well ask, however, whether the practices
of the churches correspond to its pronouncements. The
answer, of course, is that in many areas they do not. Yet
these official statements have value in creating the"bad
conscience"in the Church which can lead and have actually
led to a change of attitude.
Lastly, the Ecumenical Movement is in itself an inter-racial
fellowship. In all large ecumenical meetings and in numerous
smaller groups, Christians have learned to worship, live and
work together regardless of race. Thus they have come to
learn that such truly human relationships are the only normal
ones. In a common loyalty to their common Lord, they have
discovered a true community transcending all human barriers.

### 70548: You have to learn to make friends'

Page 10. AUGUST-SEPTEMBER 1953 UNESCO (
'YOU HAVE
TO LEARN TO
MAKE
FRIENDS'
by Syeda Saiyidain (Age 9)
New Delhi
(This article won the Jawaharlal
Nehru Prize four the age group 9-10 in
Shankar's weekly international writing
competition for children).
*
LAST year we came to stay in Delhi.At First I was very lonely. I had
no friends to play with. So one
day father said,"What a lazy girl
you are. Why don't you go out and
play ?"You see, I did not want my
father to know the real reason. But
I'll tell you the reason. You know,
once I went to play, but the girls did
not take any notice of me. I did not
tell father because I thought he would
feel sorry. So now I said,"All right,
father, but..."Father did not care
for the"but"and said,"Go, darling".
So I dressed and went out. A girl
met me and said,"Come and play
with me."I was very happy and
played with her. After some time
her other friends came. And one of
them asked me"What is your caste ?"
I did not know, so I said,"I don't
know."When I came home I asked
father,"What is our caste ?" He said,
"We do not believe in caste."
The next day when I went to play,
the girls again asked me"What is
your caste ?"I said,"We do not
believe in caste."Then one girl said
to me,"But what are you ?"I said"I am a little girl". That girl be-
came annoyed and said,"Don't be
funny, are you a Muslim or a Hindu or
a Christian or a Parsi ?"I said,
"I am a Muslim."Then she said,
"We won't play with you."I was
very angry and sorry because I fool-
ishly thought that no girl would play
with me. So I went home with a
grumpy face.
The next day when he told me to go
out and play I said,"I won't go be-
cause they say I am a Muslim and
they won't play with me."Father
smiled and said,"Never mind, go and
play with your little niece. You have
to learn to make friends."
The next evening we were all sitting
in the drawing room. The bell rang
"Tring... Tring."I went and opened
the door, and saw a tall Sikh gentle-
man with a long white beard. His
wife and a girl of my age were with
him. I went and told father that
some people had come to see him and
he said,"Tell them to come in."
I did and then ran into my own
room. After some time father called me
and said,"Here is a new friend for
you. Go and show her your dolls
and books."I took her with me and
we two played nicely together. After-
wards they went away.
I asked mother,"What did that old
gentleman say ?"Mother said,
"Oh, they are very good people. You
know, they had heard that some girls
refused to play with you. So they
came to say,'If nobody plays with
your sweet little daughter, my daugh-
ter will play with her'."
So I started to play with her. And
then do you know what happened ?
After some time other girls also joined
us. Now we all have become friends.
One day my eldest sister, who has
passed her B. A. and thinks she is a
philosopher, said to me :"Syeda,
how many friends have you now ?"
I said,"Oh, lots and lots.""Who
are they ?"I answered."They are
all little girls, Hindus, Muslims, Chris-
tians. Sikhs and all, and we have now
made a little club. Its name is
"Happy-go-Incky Club."Then my
sister said,"There are so many people
in the world and if they also become
friends like you little girls have become
they can make the world a Happy-go-
lucky Club. Can't they ?"

### 70322: Sociological aspects of race relations

SOC) OLOG) CAL ASPECTS
OF RACE RELATIONS
WHILE so much attention isbeing given these days to
the psychological and in-
terpersonal aspects of race rela-
tions, it is well not to lose sight of
t, he importance of what may be des-
cribed, broadly speaking, as the
sociological factors in the situa-
tion. For reasons which cannot be
discussed here, there is a tendency
on the part of professional students
as well as on the part of laymen to
regard psychological factors and
interpersonal relations in race re-
lations as more fundamental than
sociological factors.
After all, it is contended, the rela-
tions which exist between members
of different races are dependent
upon how individuals of different..-...races reel towards
each other, and what
ideas they have of
each other. More-
over, it is argued,
laws and practices
involving discrimi-
nation against cer-
tain racial and na-
tional groups are the
expression of the
ideas and feelings of
individuals. But
such reasoning fails
to take into account
the source and na-
ture of racial attitu-
des and the manner
in which they are
propagated in mo-
dern societies.
Let us consider
then the source and
nature of racial at-
titudes or attitudes
which people have
towards ethnic or
national groups
other than their
own. The attitudes
of members of one
racial or ethnic
group towards mem-
bers of another
group are not indi-
vidual but social at-.
titudes. They are
social attitudes in
the sense that they
represent the defini-
tions and concep-
tions which their
own group provides
of the members of a
different racial
group.
It is needless to
emnhasize what is
generally known, namely that chil-
dren do not have racial prejudices
or that racial attitudes are not
instinctive. But it is necessary to
point out another factor of great
importance. Although children
perceive differences in colour, for
example, these differences have no
racial significance until the group
of which the child is a member de-
fines them as racially significant.
This is vividly illustrated by the
case in which a white child simply
thought that her coloured playma-
te's colour was due to too much io-
dine until her own parents told. her
that she could not invite. her col-
oured playmate to her birthday
party because she was a Negro
child. It was then that colour ac-
quired significance as a racial mark
for this white child.
In regard to such racial marks as
skin colour, hair texture, and other
physical features, it should be poin-
ted out these only become signifi-
cant for race relations when they
become symbols of racial identifi-
cation. These racial marks do not
in themselves create racial pro-.
blems. In fact, in some countries
where there are people with diffe-
rent racial characteristics, race
problems and race relations do not
exist. People are categorized ra-
ther according to their class or oc-
cupations in the particular society.
This is not strange because the
manner in whic. h people are cate-
gorized is determined by a number
of historical and social factors.
When we consider the attitudes
of the members of one racial group
towards the individuals of another
racial group, we are really dealing
by Dr. E. Franklin FRAZ/fR
with the way in which members of
a race are categorized. When one is
prejudiced towards the members of
another racial group, one treats
members of that group according
to the manner in which they are
categorized rather than according
to their individual traits or quali-
ties. It is for this reason that the
study of racial stereotypes is so
important in race relations.
The prejudiced person, as it has
been said, is not prejudiced against
the individual of a different race
so much as against the categoric
picture or stereotype of the race.
This is why it is very unlikely
that prejudice against a racial
group is the result of an unpleasant
experience with a member of that
group. If cne becomes conscious
of prejudice against a group follow-
ing an unpleasant experience with
one of its members, it is most likely
that the experience has only arous-
ed a latent attitude or evoked a
latent emotional response to the
categoric picture of the racial
group.
An unpleasant experience with a
member of a different racial group
does not necessarily lead to prej u-
dice against the group. An un-
pleasant experience results in pre-
judice against another racial group
when certain social attitudes to-
wards the particular racial group
already exist in one's own group.
If these social attitudes do not exist
the unpleasant experience is reac-
ted to as an unpleasant experience
with an individual rather than
with the representative of a racial
group. Therefore, it is important
to study the nature and source of
these social attitudes.
The source of these social attitu-
des is to be found in the social heri-
tage of a group. They are as much
of the social heritage or culture of
a group as other conceptions and
values which are transmitted
through education and other means
of communication. Just as a mem-
ber of society or a particular group
assimilates unconsciously the ideals
and values of his group, he assimi-
lates the conceptions and attitudes
of his group in regard to certain
races.
A study of art and literature,
theatres, films and radio, cartoons
and comic and strips will reveal
the current racial concepts which
are part of the social heritage of a
between races so as
to give one a lower
status as, for exam-
ple, exclusion from
certain occupations,
no amount of indi-
vidual racial good-
will can overcome
the decisive influen-
ce of these institu-
tions in the forma-
tion of social attitu-
des in respect to
race.
Even if the indivi-
dual has managed
to emancipate him-
self from the current
racial attitudes, the
institutions of so-
ciety place definite
limitations upon the
extent to which he
can express his par-
t i c u 1 a r attitudes.
The restrictions
upon the expression
of his personal
feeling and attitu-
des are increased
when he is charged
with carrying out
institutional policies
in regard to race
which are opposed
to his own concep-
tions.
Something should
be added concerning
the legal institutions
and culture of a so-
ciety. T h e re is
m u c h confusion
concerning the role
of law in changing
race relations, In
the past some social
scientists have gone
so far as to state that laws have
no influence on race relations. Then
many laymen echoing this opinion
have said that laws cannot make
people friends or love each other.
All of this is not only beside the
point, but introduces confusion
into thinking on this question.
Participation in the collective
life of a political community is sel-
dom carried on on the basis of
friendship or love. The very basis
of civilized life is law. More spe-
cifically we know from experience
that laws have been responsible for
the extension of the rights and op-
portunities of racial groups.
The main purpose of this article
has been to call attention to the
obvious fact that the thinking and
feelings of individuals in regard to
members of a different racial group
are shaped and coloured, so to
speak, by the conceptions and atti-
tudes of their own group.
These conceptions and attitudes
are communicated to individuals
by the various channels of com-
munication in a society. Despite
the growing mobility of the peoples
of the world, the vast majority of
the people of the world will conti-
nue to depend upon these means
of communication for their ideas
and feelings towards other races.
On the other hand, their attitudes
and reactions to members of a dif-
ferent racial group dwelling within
their midst will depend largely
upon the institutions and laws
which regulate their relations and
determine the extent to which they
can co-operate on a basis of equal-
ity and develop mutual under-
standing and respect.
group as well as the means by
which these concepts and attitudes
are perpetuated. Studies of the at-
titudes of people have constantly
revealed these channels of commu-
nications as the source of their ra-
cial prejudices. In fact, a number
of studies have revealed that pre-
judice may be strongest against a
racial group with whom one has
never had direct contact.
The institutions of society also
play a decisive role in perpetuating
certain racial attitudes. Where
institutions prevent easy commu-
nication and association between
individuals with different racial
and cultural backgrounds as, for
example, separate schools and
churches, or define the relations

### 70332: The Bushmen of Australia in modern civilization

iSCO C COURIER AUGUST-SEPTEMBER 1953. Page II
Cut off from the rest of the world and untouched by cutside influence for untold centuries, the aborigines of. Australia are on  of the few peoples in the wor) d whose tife is still fairly close to the s one age. Their
way of life has evolved considerably during the past century and a half of contact with Western civilization,
but vestiges of their primitive customs still exist. In their natural tribal state they possess no knowledge of metals
or agriculture. They have 0 highly developed social organization however. As in all newsy-settled countries, the
indigenous inhabitants. suffered at first from their contact with the white race. It has been estimated that atthe time of the first white settlement in 1788 there were about 300, 000 aborigines in Australia. Contact with the the
white settlers was more than they could survive and the numbers dwindled as hunting grounds were reduced
with the spread of settlements. It is estimated that there are still 60, 000 full-bloods aborigines and 25, 000 half-
castes on the mainland. They are mostly nomads found in tribes scattered over the Northern Territory, the
north of Western Australia and northern Queenstand. Many roam vast reservations. They are there encouraged to
live their traditional communal tife. Others, no longer tribal, live in supervised camps. Others again live in
normal contact with the white man and are usually in employment, particularly 9S stockmen on cattle stations. The
most complete record yet made of the life of the aborigines is now being presented in the United States under
the auspices of Unesco and the U. S. and Australian Nowional Commissions for Unesco. The exhibition opened
in Buffato in June and wit ! tour the country for nearly two years. One of the most remarkable aspects of the abori-
gine of Australia is his art-a truly primitive art that is still a living art. Like the cave men of Europe, the abori-
gines who lived thousands of years ago were artists. Through the centuries which have passed since they worked with
feathers and bark brushes and tapped away patiently with stone toots, or cut outline figures in the rock, there have
always been artists among the tribes. Unesco is now eompteting p ! ans for the publication later this year or next year
of a portfolio on Australian aboriginal art. It will include 32 large reproductions in colour of the cave paintings in
Arnhem Land-in the for north.) In word and picture the COURIER presents on these pages same aspects of the
tife-fascinating both from human and scientific points of view-of the aborigines of Australia.
by Professor A. P. fLKIN
Professor of Anthropology hi the University of Sydney, Australia
B USInIE='I are those peoples of primitive culture, who
neither garden nor pasture flocks and herds. They
depend for their living s lely on hunting, fishing
(where possible) and food gathering. Such was the
life of the Palaeolithic peoples of pre-history ; such, too,
has been recently, and still is, the life of some groups as,
for example, the Bushmen of the Kalahari Desert, South
Africa, some American Indian tribes, a fe\v groups in
Malaysia and New Guinea, and especially the Australian
Aborigines.
These last are the most interesting and indeed startling,
for here was a food-gathering people of the simplest
material culture who until 1788 had been occupying a
whole continent, undisturbed for many centuries. Indeed,
fifty years ago numbers of tribes were still living in
ignorance of the existence of other races, and it is
only during the past twenty years that all have
come into contact with white peoples. Thousands
of Aborigines, however, cannot speak English, and
still depend to a large extent on food gathering
for a livelihood. I shall take the Australian Aborigines
as my example of the part played by Bushmen in modern
civilization, for I have worked amongst and for them for
a quartet of a century.
The Aborigines had developed a very effective social and'
economic adaptation to their environment. They were
divided into tribal or smaller groups, each with its re-
cognized food-gathering territory. This varied in size, as
did the density of the population, according to the food
providing character of the region. The poorer the country
and the more arid the conditions, the larger the area re-
quired for food gathering and hunting, and the smaller and
more scattered were the groups. In good food country,
smaller areas sufficed, and groups were not isolated but
often hunted and camped together, though in group order.
wherever it was, the members of a tribal group knew
all about their own country and everything in it, where and
when food and other desired articles could and should be
found, and the signs pointing to these facts. Thus, the
appearance of flowers on certain trees was correlated with
the ripeness of yams in sandy ground, and with other
phenomena.
All in all, a large body of'natural'knowledge was
passed from generation to generation.
This was not only a feat of memory, but (C 0 n t ; n u e d

### 70332: The Bushmen of Australia in modern civilization

COMPLETELY ISOLATED
FOR MANY CENTURIES...
Very early in human history-perhaps more than 60, 000 years ago-a small band of
venturesome people from south-eastern Asia arrived in Australia. Evidence indi-
cates that they were the first to people the land of the kangaroo probably settling
in Arnhem Land in the north. Even today the life of most of their descendants has
changed very little and as a race they show archaic features which have remained
unmodified down to the presents, In their natural tribal state. they possess no
applying the results of observation. When we add to this
the skill required to get some of the desired objects, or to
make such articles as spears, spearthrowers, boomerangs,
canoes and nets, we realize that the Aborigines
had and have the intellectual ability and the
potential technical skill to adapt themselves to
new situations.
There is one provision, however. No people
can readapt itself to a new way of life overnight,
nor indeed in one generation. Consequently, as
European settlement at harbours and in good
farming and grazing land was always fast and
total, the food gathering Aborigines were de-
prived of their way of life, became hangers-
on or were involved in uneven clashes. As a
result they declined rapidly, and almost the only
Aborigines to remain in the regions of success-
ful European exploitation of the land are those
of mixed blood.
In the less favourable areas, however, white
settlement was slow and sparse. The natives
were not dispossessed, though there were clashes
between them and the"invader". But the sett-
lers needed the labour of the Aborigines, and
the latter had time to realize that by working for the lormcr
they could obtain some of the white man's goods. So a
working adaptation was reached.
As a result, the Aborigines have made a positive contri-
bution to the pastoral development of Australia in the
great inland cattle and sheep areas. As stockmen, drovers,
fencers, shearers, windmill attendants, and
general handymen, they have, for a hundred
years, done most of the pastoral work in the
"outback"and"inland". Their women, too,
have done the domestic work, either substituting
for white women or making life under hard
conditions more endurable and pleasant for the
settlers'* wives. The fact is that the pastoral
industry in both the arid and the tropical regions
could not have been developed without the
Aborigines. Further, with the spread of educa-
tion and literacy amongst them, and the
establishment of better conditions of employ-
ment and reward, their contribution towards
Australia's economic life will increase.
With very few exceptions, they have not shown
an aptitude for, or interest in, farming, but the
north-coastal Aborigines have proved themselves
good and reliable boat crews. On small govern-
ment and private trading vessels their work has
been mostly menial, but on mission boats
they have filled, and-fill, all positions, except that of
master, a post filled by a \vhite man, or, often, a man of
part-Aboriginal descent. Frequently, however, the Abori-

A NEW WAY OF LIFE
Regarded in old Colonial days as being of the lowest intelligence the aborigine
remained a despised people until a better understanding of their ways spread among
white people. In recent years sincere efforts have been made to save the most
interesting of all primitive races of man from the fate of the Tasmanians who became
extinct in 1876 with the death of a romantic figure, the"Princess Truganini". The
Australian Federal Government has launched an ambitious programme to assimilate

knowledge of metals or agriculture, but they have a highly developed social orga-

generation. Professor A. P. Elkin, author of the article below, has brought back

But much more will be achieved along cultur-
al lines. For some years now, there has been a
vogue to use Aboriginal themes in Australian
poetry, Ahoriginal art motifs (especially from
Arnhem Land, North Australia) in designs
for fabrics, murals and panellings, Aboriginal musical
themes in our musical compositions, and Aboriginal myths
and legends in interpretative dancing. It remains, now,
for the Aborigines themselves to express their art, music
and dancing in ways and places which will bring their
own interpretation of life into Australia's cultural heritage.

These paintings in ochres reveal skill, aesthetic

THE REMARKABLE'X-RAY ART
OF THE MEN OF ARNHEM LAND
MAN SPEARING A KANGAROO. This bark painting is a remarkable example of the curious X-ray art-
in-which the Australian aboriginal painters depict not only the exterior outlines but also the internal organs of
their subjects. This painting by an artist ot the Kakatu tribe was collected by Sir Baldwin Spencer in 1913 at
Oenpelli, Arnhem Land. It is now in the National Museum of Victoria, Melbourne. (Australian Official Photo.)
t FTER eight months in the field, a joint
Australian-American expedition return-
ed from Arnhem Land, northern Aus-
tralia, in November 1948 with 25 tons
of specimens which included 400 sheets of
aboriginal bark drawings and photographs and
tracings of cave paintings.
The expedition found that some of these bark
paintings closely resembled the work of pre-
historic man in the caves of eastern Spain and
of the Bushman of South Africa. The scientists
brought back some particularly interesting
tracing of a hitherto little kno\vn form called
The only musical instrument devised by the Austral
"Mimi"paintings. These, the bark drawings
and their associated legends have intrigued
anthropologists. Why is the same form of pri-
mitive art found in such widely separated places
in t. he world ? Why does the Australian aborigine
have a legend of the journey tlf the dead that
is so like the story of Charon ferrying spirits
across the Styx ? These are questions which
the Arnhem Land expedition may help to solve.
The expedition was financed by the National
Geographic Society of America, the Smith-
sonian Institution and the Australian Depart-
ment of Information. It \vas the largest
by Charles P. MOUNTFORD
scientific survey yet made in Australia, and had
1C members-11 Australians, 5 Americans.
Apart from the examples of primitive art, they
brought back specimens of 15. 000 fish, 13, 500
plants, 800 birds, 600 animal skins, and much
archaeological material.
There were four naturalists ; a unit of three
scientists investigating the health and nutrition
of the aborigines ; an archaeologist determining
their historical background and an ethnologist
examining their customs. I led the party,
directed a series of documentary films on
natural history and aboriginal life, and collect-
ed examples of primitive art, recording, lheÌI'
associated legends.
We established camps in three widely
different environments-at Groote Eylandt, a
somewhat arid island in the Gulf of Carpen-
taria about 40 miles from the Arnhem Land
coast ; at Yirkalla, a coastal region bounded by
eucalyptus forests in north-Eastern Arnhem
Land, and at Oenpelli, about 150 miles east of
Darwin.
The cave paintings and bark drawings on the
north coast of Australia, and particularly ill
Arnhem Land, represent the highest develop-
ment of Australian primitive art. They are
much more advanced both in technique and
design than the crude rock engravings around
Sydney and in South Australia, or the primitive
symbolism of the desert aborigines.
Collecting specimens was much easier in
Arnhem Land than in other parts of Australia
because the aborigines had for centuries
painted pictures on the inside of their bark
huts during the rainy seasons. All we had to
do was to give the men sheets of bark about
the size of those with which their huts were
built and ask them to paint the same pictures.
All the art of Arnhem Land is closely linked
with the beliefs and philosophies of the people.
Whether the subject is a living creature, an
inanimate object, or a heavenly body, there is
almost always a legend that explains the origin
of the subject and the country to which it
belongs. I was, however, surprised to find that
the aborigines at Groote Eylandt, YirkalIa and
Oenpelli had each developed a distinctive art
form.
At Groote Eylandt, drawings consisted of
single pictures, predominantly of sea creatures.
At Yirkalla, many design elements were
skilfully woven together in decorative panels.
The drawings at Oenpelli showed not only the
external, but also the internal details of the
creatures they depicted.
Groote Eylandt drawings, although simple in
design, were skilfully and carefully executed.
For colours, the artists used red, fellow, black
and white pigments ground to a paste on a Oat
stone, and for brushes a narrow piece of
chewed bark or a small feather. It takes a
good deal of skill to draw Hne lines on the
rough bark with these primitive feather brushes.
Most bark drawings were done in a day but
some took longer.
It must be more than 40 years since Malay
fishermen last visited the northern coast of
Australia in their sailing proas, yet the aborigi-
nes have retained an accurate knowledge of the
appearance of these boats. Bark paintings
showed their general shape and accurate details
of the tripod mast, steering paddles, and even
the number and disposition of the ropes in the
rigging.

The bark drawings and cave paintings on the north coast of Australia, particularly Arnhem Land, represent the highest development of Australian aboriginal art.

Oenpelli, our last camp, was the centre of acurious but attractive form of art known for
want of a better name, as X-ray art. In this,
the artists have not only painted the external
 features of the creatures, but also the bones and
! internal organs such as the heart, stomach, liverand intestines.
Although we collected many X-ray drawings
on sheets of bark at Oenpelli, the best examples
were painted in the caves in the rugged plateau.
The walls and ceilings in some of the larger
caves were covered with a profusion of paint-
ings of birds, fish and animals but, strangely.
none of human beings.
Deep in the labyrinth of gorges, I found the
Mimi art, an entirely different form that de-
picted almost without exception thin-bodied
human beings in strong action, running, jump-
ing or fighting. The figures were crude in
design and painted entirely in deep red.
These paintings, the aborigines say, are not
the work of their ancestors. They have been
done by a fairy-like people called the Mimi,
who live under the tumbled boulders. No one
has ever seen the Mimi, because, having parti-
clIlarly keen sight and hearing, they can detect
the approach of human beings from great
distances. When they do, they run quickly to
the rocky plateau, and blow on the face of the
boulders. The rock opens like a door to admit
the Mimis to their underground home, then
closes behind them, keeping out all intruders.
The Mimis lead somewhat the same life a ?
the present day aborigines. They have wives
and children. The men hunt animals and the
women collect yams and lily roots. In the
evening the Mimis eat the food they have
gathered. My informants had to admit,
Jiowever, that they had never seen the smoke
from the Mimi's camp fires, although they often
heard them shuffling among the rocks at night.
The aborigines pointed to the attenuated
figures of the paintings to pr. ove that the Mimis
are tall and thin-so thin, indeed, that they
can only hunt in still weather. Otherwise the
wind would break their slender bodies.
Obviously the story of the Mimi ws in vented
to explain a form of art that the aborigines
could not account for in any other way. They
distinguish sharply between a painting done by
the Mimis and that done by their own relative,
Bunbalama, the mythical
woman, responsible for
creating rain. Rectangle of
dots on body represents
clouds she has made ; the
vertical bands indicate rain.
If the painting is red, and of a human being,
it is the work of a Mimi. If it is painted ill
any other colour, it is the work of an aborigine.
There is, however, such a wide difference
between the simple though lively art of the
Mimis and the colour and skilful technique or
the modern X-ray art that no one could faii
to distinguish between them.
The resemblance between the Mimi paintings
at Oenpelli and the paintings done by prehistoric
man in eastern Spain and the Bushman of
South Africa is remarkable. The figures are so
alike that, when placed side by side, one can
scarcely'detect any difference in style even
though thousands of miles separate them and
many centuries in time.
We do not know who painted the tall, thin-
bodied running people. Probably they belong-
ed to an earlier civilization though not nec-
essarily to another race. There is abundant
evidence in the ancient rock engravings of
South and Central Australia, and the small
delicately-flaked stone implements and curious
cylindro-conical stones found along the River
Darling that a different civilization once flour-
ished in Australia.

TRANSPORTATION
The canoe is the only form of transpor-
tation devised by the Australian abori-
gine. Even then he seldom used it
for travelling from one place to another
but confined its use to crossing streams
and fishing close inshore. The canoes
are made from bark stripped in one
piece from trees and in the coastal
regions of Australie many trees may
still be seen bearing the scars on the
places from where the bark was taken.
WATER
Like most primitive races, the
Australian aborigine, living in
country where water holes are
few and scattered, carries his
water supply in the skins of
animals. His water bag is
usually the skin of the kangaroo
or wallaby, which after careful
sleeve skinning, is tied with
fibre or raw hide and filled with
grass to keep shape until it is
eventually dried out in the sun.
WALKABOUT
The Australian aborigine, in his native state, is essentially
nomadic and travels on his walkabout very lightly. His
properly is limited to fighting and hunting equipment.
The gin or lubra acts as his beast of burden, and carries,
according to the season and district, a skin waterbag, a
small dilly bag and a bark basket for the storage of food and ;
on occasion, a piccaninny. These baskets, bound with
native hemp, are light, strong and colourfully decorated.
CEREMONY
Mourning is essentially a feminine
ritual in the life of the Australian
aborigines. The bereaved widow is
required to mourn her husband from
three to six months. During this time
she wears the mourning armlet and
carries the mourning wreath as signs
of her sorrow. Both these are very de-
corative symbols of aboriginal art.
After the mourning period, the widow
is segregated from the males in the
same way as are the unmarried gills,
where she remains until she marries.
GIN
It is generally believed that aboriginal women lead a life
of semi-slavedom. But though life is harder for women
than for men the division of labour between the two is
clearly defined. The male is the hunter and warrior ; the
gin wields the digging stick and forages for most food.
Her"marriage"often takes place at an early age and she
may"re-marry"several times. One strange custom which
is rigidly observed : no man may look at his mother-in-law
nor may she in her turn look at him under any circumstances.
SUPERNATURAL
Djanba, Divine Thunder of the
Nor'-west. The Australian
aborigine thinks a great deal
about things beyond the earthly
sphere. The wld around him
is alive with supernatural
beings, friendly and hostile.
Found in the wilds of Kimberley
(W. A.) by Rev. Father Worms,
this figure was covered with
human blood applied during a
secret rain-ceremony. Inten-
tionally small, it represents
Djanba, the Invisible. Even
more awesome rites have been
rehearsed before it, witnessed
only by the initiated. Who
would dare peer into these
mysterious performances ?

CONFLICT
The shield is the on ! y form of
armour used by the Australian
aborigine through the centuries
of almost continuous inter-
tribal warfare. Gaudily deco-
rated to the individual taste of
the warrior, these shields are
made from the underbark of
trees. In the deft hands of the
quick-eyed aborigine fighter,
these shields are most effec-
tive in glancing off the spears,
throwing sticks and boome-
rangs used in native battles.
RELAXATION
Itis not generally known that
the Australian aborigine
enjoyed pipe smoking even
beþjre his contact with the
white man's civilization. His
"fragrant weed"was a
variety of the dock. the
fleshy leaves of which, when
dried, resemble tobacco.
The stems of the pipes were
often decorated or carved
to satisfy the aesthetic taste
of its owner. Smoking,
however, was restricted
by custom to the males
and to the older gins.
FOOD
Fish trapping is an art at which the Australian aborigines
who live in river country become very adept. The traps
are made from reeds, twigs and native string and are set
at strategic parts of streams where fish are known to be.
The shallow waters are dammed back and the traps moored
in a narrow outlet. Usually the tribe drive the river to the
accompaniment of help from lubras, children and dogs.
SURGERY
Surgery is practised by the Australian
aboriginal tribes for ceremonial and
operating purposes. The instruments
are flaked from flint, principally from
the almost legendary Ngillipidgi Quarry,
and are of razor-like sharpness. The
native method of treating wounds is a
crude form of cauterisation, performed
by cutting into the wound and filling
the cavity with hot cinders or clay.
Fortunately the aborigine is more sto-
ical towards pain than the white man.
PICCANINNY
Traditionally fond of children,
aborigines treat their young-
sters with tolerance, amuse-
ment and affection. Hardly
before he is over the toddler
stage the aborigine boy begins
to play with miniature spears
and other weapons. At about
the age of five this play is
taken seriously and from then
a spear is seldom out of his
hand, though he will be well
into his teens before being
considered proficient in its use.
Up to this time, his life will for
the most part be spent with
the women and children of the
tribe except when he is segre-
gated to undergo preparation
for the various initiations-an
important part of his education.
FIRE
cnarcoal which can be blown into life and so obviate the
tedious task of using the firestick. Those illustrated above
are used by the Arunta tribe from Central Australia, the
only aborigines who decorate their fire lighting sticks.
The only method of fire-making used by
Australian aborigines is with firesticks.
By revolving between their hands a
hard mulga wood stick on a piece of
softer wood, heat is generated to ignite
the tinder. On short trips the abori-
gines usually carry a glowing piece of
MESSAGES
One of the Australian aborigine's claims to
literacy is the use of message sticks which
have long baffled leading anthropologists.
The carvings are not writing in our sense,
nor are they hieroglyphics in the Egyptian
sense, but they have been used as aids to
memory, safety passports through hostile
country, requests for medicine and tobacco,
and at means of locating water holes.
THE RAIN MAKER
WITCHCRAFT
There's rarely any escape for the unfor-
tunate aborigine who is the subject of
the awesome bone-pointing ceremony,
even though he be hundreds of miles
away from the"bone"which is pointed
at him. So great is the belief in the
fearful magic of bone pointing that
immediately an aborigine hears"that
the"bone"has been pointed at him,
he lies down and within a few days is
dead, a victim of suggestion. His only
hope is the ceremonial extraction of
the bone by a medicine man. The
"bone"is usually a small round piece
of wood or bone, pointed at both ends,
and it IS ornamented with markings.

THE RACE QUESTION IN
MODERN SCIENCE (Series)
Each volume : $. 25 ; 1/6 ; 75 frs.
* Racial Myths, by Juan Comas.
The author traces the originsof racialism and its evolution
throughout the centuries., and
shows that such manifestations
take root whenever individual
and collective security appear
to be menaced. The myths of
blood superiority and of the
racial inferiority of the Jews,
coloured peoples and hybrids
are analvsed and exposed.
* Race and Biology, by L. C. Dunn.
In this booklet, the author
shows by scientific analysis
that the old views of fixed and
absolute biological differences
are without scientific justi-
fication. The operation of
heredity clearly proves that in
the human species there is no
such thing as a pure race in the
sense of one in which all
members are alike.
* Race and Culture, by Michel
Leiris.
Within the framework of
three principal sections :"Scope
and concept of race","Man and
his cultures"and"There is no
inborn racial aversion", the
author undertakes an objective
analysis of the ways in which
racial prejudice was able to
become established and to
spread for reasons that are
essentially economic and social.
* Race and Psychology, by otto
Klineberg,
By submitting examples of
the kinds of psychological tests
given to different racial groups,
and giving the reasons for their
validity or non-validity, the
author shows that the net
result of all the research con-
ducted in this field is to the
effect that innate racial differ-
ences in intelligence have not
been demonstrated. The re-
lation of physique to mentality,
the effects of race mixtures,
differences in personality and
temperament are among the
other subjects here discussed.
* The Roots of Prejudice, by Arnold
M. Rose.
An objective analysis of the
causes and effects of prejudice,
with suggestions for action to
reduce its presence in in-
dividuals or groups. The au-
thor analyses as some of the
causes of prejudice : apparent
personal advantages to be
gained thereby ; ignorance of
other groups ; and the"su-
peri<Jrity complex". He dis-
cusses also the transmission of
prejudice to children, the
psychology of prejudice, and
prejudice as a warping of the
nl'rsonaJitv.
* Race and History, by Claude Level-
Strauss.
The contributions made by
various races of men to world
civilizations constitute the cen-
tral theme of this publication.
The question of the alleged
superiority of the white man's
civilization is studied in detail ;
emphasis is placed on the
danger of evaluating cultural
institutions on a purely evo-
lutionarv basis.
* The Significance of Racial Dif-
ferences, by G. M. Morant.
Human populations differ in
mentality and behaviour ; the
problem is to discover why this
is so. In this study, the author
takes up the controversial
question of deciding how far
the observed differences are
due to essential differences in
quality, and how far they can
be attributed to modifying con-
ditions of life. His conclusion
is that although differences in
mental characters are more
difficult to define and assess
than physical differences-and
conclusions for these are hence
uncertain-it is unrealistic to
deny the existence of such
differences. However, their sig-
nificance appears to be pro-
gressively reduced as knowledge
increases.
* Race and Society, by Kenneth L.
Little.
A review of the contrasting
attitudes towards race as ma-
nifested by different national
groups, with particular em-
phasis on the racial question in
England. The author's con-
tention is that race prejudice
and its effects will diminish
only after profound economic
and political changes have
taken place.
* The Race Concept (Results of an
Inquiry).
Since the appearance in 195U
of the first Unesco"Statement
on Race"and the second
"Statement on the Nature of
Race and Racial Differences",
drawn up in 1951, much interest
has been shown, and many
questions raised, with regard to
Unesco's race programme. The
Race Concept c 1 ear 1 y and
frankly discusses the genesis,
development and controversies
surrounding Unesco's parti-
cipation in the campaign
against race prejudice and
gives the reader an intimate
glimpse into the problems that
confronted Unesco in issuing a

### 70339: Race relations and public housing in the United States

RACE RELATIONS
AND PUBLIC HOUSING
IN THE UNITED STATES
by Patricia Salter WEST
and Maria jAHODA
THE development of publicly subsidized
housing proj ects in the United States,
in which apartments are available
on equal terms to White and Negro
people, has provided numerous opportunities
for the study of attitudes-and changes in
attitudes-among these groups.
Even before the studies began, it was
noted that there had been a great demand
for this unsegregated housing by both
groups, showing at the outset that the various
motives which led people into public
housing were stronger than the prejudices
which would tend to repel them.
Observations of this unsegregated housing
were made by groups of sociologists and
psychologists who conducted community
surveys of people's actions and feelings as
tenants of these projects. One study,
supported by the Lavanburg Housing Foun-
dation of New York City and carried on by
sociologists of Columbia University's Bureau
of Applied Social Research, was of a project
in an eastern industrial city, pseudo-named
Hilltown, containing 400 Negro and
400 White families.
The other, conducted by the Research
Center for Human Relations of New York
University, studied two New York City and
two Newark, New Jersey, projects with
different proportions of Negroes and Whites
and different degrees of partial segrega-
tion.
First of all, these studies make us look
more closely at prejudices and ask where
they come from. If a white man tells us
he does not trust Negroes-assuming he is
generally a man of goodwill and good sense
- we will begin to wonder whom he has
been associating with ; but we would prob-
ably be wrong in assuming he had had
some unfortunate Negro acquaintances.
The chances would be greater that he had
never known any Negroes at all. The
tenants of United States public housing
prove this and support the feeling of a
psychologist who said that"Attitudes
toward Negroes are now chiefly determined,
not by contact with Negroes, but by contact
with prevalent attitudes toward Negroes".
True to the predictions of opponents of
non-segregated housing, many prospective
White tenants felt they were letting
themselves in for trouble, that there was apt
to be conflict between the members of the
two races. But some had these premonitory
fears more than others : and these were the
people who had never had any experience
with living in the same neighbourhood with
members of the other race before.
In Hilltown well over half (56 %) of these
"inexperienced Whites"expected real con-
flict between the two races in the projects,
while this open trouble was anticipated by
only 10% of the Whites who had had
Negroes as neighbours before.
It turned out that the latter, more expe-
rienced, Whites were also the more realistic,
for the five-year history of the project
boasted no serious racial incidents or
conflicts at all. In fact, by their own
testimony many of the trepidations were
wrong, for fully 80 % of all the Whites,
looking bask on their lives in the project,
summed up the Negroes and Whites
getting along together as"pretty well".
In these housing projects, situations exist
for Negroes and Whites to get first-hand
information about each other. But, the
sceptic will say, do people really take

Price : $1. 25 ; 7/6 ; 350 fr.
This publication is the result
of a research project on the
subject of race relations in
Brazil undertaken by Unesco.
As the title indicates, it is a
s t u d y of the relationships
between social classes in the
rural scene as well as of race
relations under rural con-
ditions. (Over 70% of Brazil's
people live in small towns of
less than 5, 000 people, or in the
countryside). Each of the
communities dealt with is rep-
resentative of a different re-
gion of rural Brazil.
THE RACE QUESTION IN
MODERN THOUGHT
(Series)
The Catholic Church and the Race
Question, by Father Yves Congar.
Price : $. 40 ; 2/- ; 100 frs.
Here, the race question in
relation to Catholic dogma is
reviewed by an eminent Ca-
tholic theologian. Father Con-
gar sets forth the position of
the Catholic Church in the
problem from the spiritual, the
social and the historical points
of view. He shows that the
principles of Catholicism are
profoundly opposed to racial
discrimination, and that the
Church has courageously op-
posed"racialism"during the
recent persecutions. (See arti-
cle by Father Congar on page
8.)
* Jewish Thought as a Factor in
Civilization, by Professor Leon
Roth (in preparation).
The author, a philosopher
and historian, examines the
contribution of Judaism to the
values which form the basis of
our civilization. He refutes the
accusation of"racialism"so
often levelled against the Jews,
by producing evidence of every-
thing in Judaism that is the
very negation of racial ex-
clusivity, and he also em-
phasizes the extent of the debt
we owe to Jewish thought and
its part in the formation of
Western civilization.

* The Teacher Was Black (A
Unesco sponsored publication) by
H. E. O. James and Cora Tenen.
The subject of this book is an
experiment in international un-
derstanding sponsored by
Unesco. It describes the re-
actions of children in an English
school to people from other
lands who came to their town
during and after the war, and
before and after these children
had been taught by two Negro
teachers from Nigeria. Before
they had had this experience
the children thought of other
races in the generally distorted
fashion they had learned from
comics, films and propaganda.
When they actually met the
Negro teachers their ideas were
modified as well as their whole
attitude to other peoples.

gation : ï and9%.
How does this change of mind come about ?
It is in all likelihood pl'Oduced by a chain
of minor events, such as women gossipillg
over laundry tubs, children meeting in
halhYL1Ys and play-yards, men borrowing
tools. These experiences, common among
neighbours enrywhere, lead to close
acquaintance and sometimes friendship,
even when they occur between Negroes and
Whites.
For example, the N. Y. U. studies showed
that in the segregated projects only about
;  % of the White housewiHs knew any of
the Negro women on a"first-name basis".
In the fully unsegregatrd pl'Ojects half and
three quarters, respectinly, of the White
housf'\YlHS were thus familiar with Negro
housewives. In HiHtown, many more Ne-
gro-White friendships were c) aimed by the
people living in unsegregated areas of the
project : in fact, the c) oser were other-race
buildings, the more likely were tenants to
have other-race friends.
Close acquaintance and friendship leads
people (some, of course : not all) to get rid
of their stereotypes about the other race and
to judge each other more on the basis of fact
than hearsay. A caSe in point : Hilltown
Whites were asked to guess the average
educational leHI of the Negro tenants
(which happened to be about the same as
lhe Whites'.) True to the stereotype which
depicts Negroes as uneducated, most Whites
guessed that their Negro neighbours were
less educated than themselves. But, 48 %
of the Whites with Negro friends and
acquaintances in lIilltown guessed correctly,
while only : 10 % of those without Negro
friends or acquaintances in llilllown guessed
correctly.
Thus, we see a circular process at work :
in one direction a beneficent, in the other, a
vicious circle. Keep races apart in separated
projects or in separate areas within a project
and they will not learn facts about each
other through personal experience ; hence
they will have to judge each other by hear-
- say, which leads to unrealistic fears and
strengthens their desired to keep part. But.
bring races closer together and you stand a
good chance of fostering friendships, which
tend to destroy stereotypes and stereotyped
fears, and which in turn leads them to ap-
prove of mixed residence.
Of course, this is a simplified picture, and
risks exaggeration. These are just [t'/ldt, t/-
des and do not necessarily hold for all
people : for example, American Southerners
and perhaps people of different economic
classes might react differently. This, fu-
ture studies will have 10 find out.
adnwlnge of this opportunity, or do they
simply draw the ('[oak of prejudice tighter
about themselves so as to avoid the conta-
mination threatened by the new contacts ?
The answer is"it depends".
If a local authority decides to interpret
unsegregated housing as requiring the
completely random assignment of apart-
ments so that some negro and White
families live on the same hallway, share the
same stairs, courtyards, playgrounds, and
other facilities convenient to nextduur
neighbours, the desirable rapprochement
really occurs, not among all but among a
considerable number of tenants. If non-
segregated housing means separate Negro
and White buildings or, worse, separate
little racial ghettos within the project, it need
not have this effect at all.
Here is some of the material from the
communitv studies which demonstrates
this point.
Two of the projects in the N. Y. t. study
did provide real next-door-neighbour living
for Negroes and Whites. The other two
had separate buildings and racia ! neigh-
bourhoods within the projects. In the former
two 38 % and 40 % were still in favour of
racial segregation : but in the latter-with
the separate racial buildings and neigh-
bourhoods-many more were for segre-

THE PITCAIRN ISLAND
DESCENDANTS OF THE
BOUNTY MUT) NEERS
(Continued from page 7.)
How far the romantic aura that
surrounds these people has seduc-
ed their visitors is beyond cal-
culation.
In the mid-nineteenth century
the typical reaction was delight
in finding so moral, upright and
virtuous a colony sprung from
mutineers, from violence and
from murder. Nowadays, being
less concerned with religiou. s
matters, with on the whole rather
different values, the present visi-
tor is less impressed by these qua-
lities and is likely to prize other
aspects of their character.
For my part I can only report
that, allowing for their isolation
and for a consequent
lack of sophistica-
tion, I found the
Pitcairn Islanders an
intelligent and at-
tractive people. And
I was struck by the
number of men and
women of impressive
character, possesses
of the qualities that
make for leadership.
Although biologi-
cally rather more of
what might be called
objective informa-
tion is accessible,
still it can only be
used for comparative
purposes with cau-
tion. Even such
standard criteria as
physical vigour, lon-
getivy or health can-
not be properly used
for such purposes
without reference to
diet, climate and va-
rious other environ-
mental conditions.
Both on Norfolk and
Pitcairn Islands the
physical condition of
the islanders was
excellent. In spite
of the inbreeding,
which has especially
characterized Pit-
cairn, I found no
physical deformities
or obvious signs of
degeneration.
On Pitcairn with a
population of 200
(1936) there were no
individuals incapa-
ble of taking care of
themselves, nor any
cases of serious
mental deficiency.
This is an excellent
record compared
with the frequency
of such cases in Eu-
rope and the United
States, especially in
remote, inbred vil-
lages.
In view of the fact
that neither on Pit-
cairn nor Norfolk is
there any resident
medical services or
even trained nurs-
ing aid, the longe-
vity of the popula--..
tion is impressive. In 1924, out
of a population of about 600 on
Norfolk, there were 24 who were
over 65 years of age, with the
oldest reaching 95 years. On
Pitcairn there were 12 between
the ages of 65 and 86 in a popu-
lation of 200.
There have been some claims
that hybrids are smaller and
weaker than their parents. Dav-
enport and Steggerda on the
basis of their study of race mix-
ture in Jamaica believed their
PRESENT DAY
ISLANDERS
data demonstrated this conclu-
sion. The Pitcairn and Norfolk
evidence is quite the contrary.
Indeed, there is evidence here of
hybrid vigour comparable to the
vigour that can be demonstrated
experimentally in a large number
of animal and plant crosses and
which is real enough to be com-
mercially valuable to seed compa-
nies.
For example, if we take size as
a measure of heightened physio-
logical vigour as is done for maize
or crossbred domestic animals,
we find that the average stature
of the parental groups is 171. 4
centimeters for Tahitian males
and 170. 6 centime-
ters for the muti-
neers (based on Bri-
tish Admiralty re-
cords but possibly a
little low since some
of the sailors were
not fully mature
men). The modern
Englishman averages
around 172 centime-
ters. The first gene-
ration descendants,
averaged 177. 8 cen-
timeters (minimum
5 feet 9 1/2 inches,
maximum 6 feet 1/4
inch). This repre-
sents an average
increase of over two
inches, with the
shortest male ex-
ceeding the average
of his parental
groups by a consid-
erable margin. Alt-
though this striking
increase has not
been fully main-
tained in the present
generation, it is still
almost an inch
above the parental
average.
As another index
of this vigour, the
reproductive rate of
the islanders is
equally notable. I
have already refer-
red to the prodi-
giously rapid growth
of the colony which
has produced in 160
odd years well over
1, 000 descendants.
This may be appre-
ciated from the birth
rate by generations.
The first generation
averaged 7. 44 chil-
dren per mating, the
second 9. 10, the third
5. 39. Since then
there has been a
further decline. The
rate in the second
generation is one of
the highest on re-
cord for any com-
munity and reflects
an unusual repro-
ductive vigour.
As far as the
evidence goes, then,
the Pitcairn exper-
iment lends no support for the
thesis that race mixture merely
leads to degeneration or at best
produces a breed inferior to the
superior parental race. In fact,
we see in this colony some support
for heightened vigour, for an ex-
tended variation and for a suc-
cessful issue of the mingling of
two diverse strains.

### 70340: World news is everyone's concern

COVER PAGE OF THE UNESCO PUBLICATION"TRANSMITTING WORLD NEWS"WHICH PRESENTS
WORLD NEWS IS E
WHEN Charles Havas founded
the world's first news agency
in Paris in 1835, Samuel F.
Morse, in New York, was developing
an instrument which two years later
was to be hailed as the first"elec-
tromagnetic recording telegraph".
Morse's invention involved use of the
"dot-dash"code which bears his
name.
The Havas agency collected and
translated extracts from the Euro-
pean newspapers it received by post
and distributed them to the Paris
press. By 1840, Havas had his own
correspondents in most European
capitals and had established a pi-
geon post to distribute news to pa-
pers in Brussels and London as well
as Paris. In the same year, Morse
opened a 40-mile telegraph line for
public business between Washington
and Baltimore.
The telegraph was soon to put the
pigeon post out of existence. At
the same time, it was enormously to
increase the scope of Havas itself
and make possible the rise of other
news agencies. But in America, as in
Europe, telegraph charges remain-
ed high. In 1848, six New York
newspapers founded the New York
Associated Press to share the ex-
pense of bringing news to their city.
They thus created a precedent in co-
operative news-gathering which was
greatly to influence development of
the world press.
The third of the world's news
agencies, Wolff's Bureau of Berlin,
was founded in 1849 following ex-
pansion of the Prussian State tele-
graph. The fourth, Reuters of Lon-
don, came into being two years later
as a result of the laying between
Dover and Calais of the first success-
ful submarine cable. Julius Reuter
had then, as throughout his career,
an instinct for"following the cable."
by Philip
It was by trusting his instinct that
he achieved world-wide success in
the news agency field.
Thus began a new era that was
eventually to put a girdle round the
earth in far less than the 40 minutes
required by Puck in Shakespeare's
Midsummer Night's Dream. With it
came a development of international
reporting by cable, telegraph, tele-
phone, radio and television which is
completely transforming man's un-
derstanding of the world around
him.
"The free flow of news is not
merely the concern of those profes-
sionally involved in its collection and
distribution, but of all men and all
nations", says Francis Williams in a
graphic study, Transmitting World
News, just published by Unesco.
Formerly editor of the London Daily
Herald and Governor of the British
Broadcasting Corporation during
1951-1952, Mr. Williams is a noted
authority on the world press.
In this study he surveys the deve-
lopment of world communications
and the press, illustrates which
areas of the world are well or insuf-
ficiently served by these media and
jshows how high costs and delays in
transmitting press reports hamper
the flow of news between nations.
Finally, he suggests means of over-
coming such obstacles to effective
enjoyment of freedom of informa-
tion.
Mr. William's book is the latest in
a series of studies produced by
Unesco in an effort to focus public
attention on obstacles to the"free
flow of ideas by word and image."
Transmitting World News is con-
cerned with the physical means of

communication."It is thus a note
on a theme as old as civilization",
the author declares."The struggle
to destroy the distances that keep
men apart goes back, in one form or
another, to the beginning of his-
tory."Modern communications
are"the direct successors of the sig-
nal fire on the hill, the drum in
the forest, the courier on the horse,
the messenger in the boat, the pi-
geon in the air, the dispatch sent by
coach or train ; of all those means,
indeed, by which communities have
sought, since society began, to satis-
fy the need to communicate rapidly
with each other."
Every day some 7, 500 newspapers
and 5, 000 radio transmitters bring
information to the world's peoples.
Ninety per cent of these journals
and 80 per cent of the transmitters
receive domestic news from over 70
national news agencies, most of
which also distribute international
news from one or more of the.
"world"news agencies.
The world agencies, which deal
largely with the transmission of news
across frontiers, are concentrated
in four national groups. They
are Reuters (British Common-
wealth)) ; Agence-France-Presse
(France) ; Tass (Soviet Union) ;
Associated Press, United Press and
International News Service (United
States).
These six agencies, Mr. Williams
points out, serve as many as 144
States and territories, which toge-
ther contain 98. 7 per cent of the
world's population. But they, like
the national news agencies and in-
dividual newspapers, are hindered in
their task of reporting news and
opinion by the lack of communica-
tion facilities, or because these faci-
lities are technically retarded, slow
and expensive.
Severely hampering the flow of
news are the high cost of transmitt-
ing press dispatches to and from
various parts of the world-notably
Latin America, the Middle East and
Asia-and the wide discrepancies in
rates charged for similar communic-
ations services. These charges
vary from country to country by
over 300 per cent.
Mr. Williams cites examples in all
continents to illustrate what he des-
cribes as the"chaotic nature of the
international press rate structure."
The ordinary press rate from Lon-
don to Moscow, for instance, is 4. 6
cents a word ; from Paris to Moscow
(approximately the same distance)
8. 8 cents. The charge from London
to Cairo is 4. 0 cents ; Paris-Cairo,
10. 0 cents. Turning from Europe to
North America, we find that the
rate from New York to Rio de Jan-
eiro is 8. 0 cents ; from Montreal to
Rio de Janeiro (approximately the
same distance), 12. 0 cents. Conver-
sely, while the charge from New
York to Sydney, Australia is 6. 5
cents, the Montreal-Sydney rate is
only 2. 0 cents.
Striking disparities are also reveal-
ed in two-way press traffic. It may
cost considerably more to send news
in one direction than in reverse.
The rate from London to New York,
for example, is 2. 0 cents ; from New
York to London, 5. 5 cents. The
charge from Rome to Bangkok is
21. 3 cents ; the return rate is 14. 3
cents.
Another related obstacle is the
frequent delays in the reception,
transmission and delivery of press
messages. These may greatly dimi-
nish or even destroy the value of
news reports. To ensure priority
of tt-patment, news agencies and
individual correspondents often
have no choice but to pay the ur-
gent press rate, which may be three
or four times the ordinary charge.
High press rates, Mr. Williams
declares, prevent newspapers and
news agencies from extending their
coverage to many parts of the world,
especially to less advanced areas
where fuller reporting is essential to
international understanding. At
the same time, smaller or less weal-
thy newspapers cannot afford to
subscribe to basic news services, let
alone maintain their own corres-
pondents abroad. The overall effect
is to limit the volume and variety of
world news, particularly information
which gives an interpretative back-
ground to current events.
As a long term solution, the author
urges establishment of a universal
low press rate. Citing the expe-
rience of certain communication
services, he suggests that a uniform
reduced rate might result in such an
increased volume of press traffic as
to be economically feasible.
Mr. Williams further proposes that
the International Telecommunica-
tion Union (I. T. U.) should establish
a consultative committee"to exa-
mine the whole question of telecom-
munication facilities in the light of
the international public interest."
This committee, jointly representing
the I. T. U. and the press, would seek
to :
1. reduce the present wide gap
between highest and lowest
rates and fix uniform charges
for two-way press traffic ;
2. obtain more uniform rental
for teleprinter networks ;
3. establish lower charges for
cable lines jointly rented by
two or more newspapers or
news agencies ;
4. assure a cheaper and more
extensive international tele-
photo service. The commit-
tee would report to the inter-
governmental conferences pe-
riodically convened by the
I. T. U. to revise the world's
telegraph, telephone and ra-
dio regulations.
- The author also draws attention
to shortages in information facilities,
pointing out that the continents
where illiteracy is high-Africa,
Asia and South America-are poor-
est in communication and press
services. As a corollary, he notes
that, of the 45 States which lack
AUGUST-SEPTEMBER 1953. Page 21
national news agencies. 31 have an
illiteracy rate of over 40 per cent.
"In view of the urgent need to
make available to the peoples of
. underdeveloped areas a basic and
independent service of essential
world news", Mr. Williams state,"the major news agencies should
examine the possibility of supplying
newspapers in such areas with a
summarized non-profit news service
transmitted by radio". He asks
telecommunication administrations
to co-operate in this public service
by providing transmitters and by
permitting direct receipt of these
newscasts by the newspapers con-
cerned.
In a foreword to the book, Unesco
declares that"the present paucity of
information to and from large areas
of the world is difficult to accept
with complacency in an era in which
science has opened up boundless
possibilities for full and rapid com-
munications". The Organization
expresses the hope that the book
will help to secure adoption of re-
medial measures at the next Inter-
national Telegraph and Telephone
Conference, to be convened by the
I. T. U. in 1955.
At the last International Telegraph
and Telephone Conference in 1949,
Unesco submitted a number of pro-
posals to assure greater facilities for
the press. The Conference made
the following favourable decisions :
(1) a new and more comprehensive
definition of press dispatches was.
adopted ; (2) administrations were
urged to increase construction of
telephone circuits as a means of
facilitating transmission of dispat-
ches ; (3) a system was adopted for
the uniform reduction of press rates.
Unesco will continue its action on
behalf of the press at the 1955 Con-
ference.
Mr. Williams'book has mean-
while been brought to the attention
of the Economic and Social Council,
at its summer session in Geneva, by
Mr. Salvador P. Lopez, United Na-
tions Rapporteur on freedom of in-
formation. In a report on press
problems, he has urged the Council
to act on the issue of rates and
priorities as part of its effort to
promote freedom of information.

During the early half of the 19th century the first news agencies such as Havas
and Reuters used pigeons to distribute news. By 1840 Havas had pigeon ser-
vices working between Brussels, London and Paris. Reuter's first news venture,
in 1850, included among other things, a pigeon post between Aachen and Brussels.

florins, the equivalent of £1, 200 at
present values.
The collection of Rimington Wil-
son (2, 310 volumes) included, in
addition to printed works and incu-
nabula, many extremely valuable
manuscripts. One of these was a
copy of the Cessoles manuscript,
referred to above, dating from 1466.
This library was put up for auction
in London in 1928 and Bernard
Quaritch, a firm dealing in ancient
books, acquired most of the works.
Vida's poem, translated into English
verse by Oliver Goldsmith-a manu-
script written entirely in the Eng-
lish author's hand-was sold for
not.
The largest
of all chess
libraries was
that of John
G ri swold-
White, a
lawyer of Cle-
veland, in the
United States,
who died in
1928 at the
age of 83. He
spent more
than 60 years
assembling a
collection 0 f
12, 000 volumes
which includ-
have produced theorists of impres-
sionist, cubist and surrealist chess.
It is thus easy to see how enthu-
siasm has led so many chess lovers
to make collections of ancient and
contemporary books. The first
systematic study on this question
was the work of Dr. A. van der
Linde. This first-rate player pro-
duced the first, and already very
complete, bibliography on works
published up to his time (Gesc/ncTe
und Literatur des Schachspiels, Ber-
lin, 1874).
In addition to the Rimington
Wilson collection and his own, van
der Linde refers to several other
large chess libraries of the middle
19th century. In particular he
speaks of the collection of R. Franz,
which was broken up ; that of van
Heydebrand von der Las. a, which
was in Poland at the outbreak of the
ed some items of inestimable worth
on the game of chess. He bequeath-
ed his collection to the city of
Cleveland which now, therefore, pos-
sesses the largest public chess libra-
ry in the world.
Other public chess libraries which
came into existence in a similar
way include that of Princeton
University in the United States
which was founded on the collection
of 2, 000 volumes-some of them
extremely rare-which formed the
collection of'E. B. Cook, and that of
the Municipal Library of Grenoble,
France, which, since 1856 has
possessed a fine collection inherited
from Frédéric Alliey.
The most remarkable of existing
private chess libraries is undoubtedly
that of a Dutchman, Dr. Niemeyer,
of Wassenaar, near The Hague.
Among its 4, 000 volumes is a first
edition of Damiano's treatise of
which only three copies now exist (1)
as well as a first edition (1749) of
Philidore's famous work,"L'Analyse",
the first really rational work on
chess. Although, in addition to his
mother tongue, M. Niemeyer speaks
English, German, French, Italian,
Spanish, Greek, Latin and several
other languages, he still needs the
help of a translator in order to read
some of his books for they include
texts in many Slav languages, in
Arabic, Yiddish, Chinese, Japanese,
Icelandic, as well as in such dialects
as Telegu, Urdu and many others.
To be able to replay all the moves
in a game it is not necessary
to know the language in which
the book describing the game is
published. Chess notation is in-
ternational. and so it is easy for a
player in any country to follow the
performances of champions of other
nationalities.
Dr. Niemeyer's library,. however, is
only one part of his chess collections.
He has many varied and precious
items which evoke the history of
chess, prints, engravings, autographs
and chess sets.
Before the outbreak of the Second
World War two other chess libraries
were often referred to-those of
Harald Folk and Albrecht Buschke.
The first of these collectors disap-
peared during the conflict, and the
second is now living in New York.
The author of this article has a
library comprising more than 1, 600
works.
To deal adequately with the sub-
ject of collections of chessmen and
chess sets would require a separate
article. Some of these items have
great historic importance. The Bib-
liotheque Nationale in Paris, for
instance, possesses a few chessmen
from the ivory set given to Charle-
magne by the Em-
peror of Byzan-
tium. Visitors to
one Paris museum.
the Musée de Clu-
ny, can admire a
magnificent chess-
board of cedar
with chessmen car-
ved in quartz and
mounted on silver-
gilt which were
offered to St. Louis
by the Prince of
the Bedouin.
These ancient
chess sets com-
mand high prices.

dia before the fifth century A. D. in
which four players used a pattern
of 64 squares, that chess, as we
know it today, was evolved.
From India chess was introduced
into Persia in the 6th century during
the reign of Chosroes the First and
immediately became extremely pop-
ular. In"Shahname" (The Book
of Kings) a history of Persia written
in verse by the celebrated poet Fir-
dousi, there are two chapters des-
cribing and praising the game.
While new cultural currents were
taking chess from India to China
and later to Korea and Japan in the
East, and from Iran to Russia and
Scandinavia in the West, the Arabs
conquered Persia and were quick to
adopt the game. So it was under
the banners of Islam that the noble
game was introduced first into
Spain from where it spread to all the
Mediterranean countries of Europe.
Towards the XIIIth century when
it had conquered practically the
whole of Europe, the game of chess
acquired its present form, and it is
from this period that the beginnings
of a vast flood of writing exclusively
about chess can be dated. The
oldest known European manuscript
on the subject, that of Jacobus de
Cessole which was written around
1200 A. D., contains just a few refer-
ences to the game. The writing of
books on the subject of chess which
has progressively increased down the
centuries was really inaugurated by
two other manuscripts-that of King
Alfonso of Castille (1252-1284), now
kept in Madrid, and the celebrated
work known as the"Bonus Socius"
(circa 1286) the principal copy of
which is now preserved in Florence.
Today there are more than 20, 000
works on chess. There are also
many others like the already men-
tioned Book of Kings and Rabelais'
ALTHOUGHwe know
"'*'that games
played on a series
of squares date
back to very an-
cient times, for we
find them illus-
trated in Theban
paintings made
during the reign of
Rameses the Third,
and also in Greek
and Roman fres-
coes, the game of
chess itself is not
as old as many
people imagine. It
was from a game
first played in In-
French (18th century), Ivory and ebony.Russian (19th century). Red and white ivory.Siamese (19th century). Painted ivory.

COURIER,
AUGUST-SEPTEMBER 1953. Page 23
International by its system of notation and its universal popularity, chess is a cultural activity combining unaerstanding and friendly rivalry. (COI Photo).
dating from the 10th century was
purchased by the American Art
Galleries, New York, for $7,000 in
1927. Today the most famous col-
lections are those of Mr. Liddell, in
New York and of M. J. Maunoury, in
Paris.
Chess is an international game
which because of its system of
notation enables enthusiasts in all
countries to follow its development
throughout the world. It is also
international because it has spread
to every continent creating links
between Europe and the remote
islands of the Pacific and between
equatorial forests and polar regions,
and today it provides an example of
one of the few cultural activities in
which broad understanding and
friendly rivalry prevails.
The International Chess Fede-
ration (FIDE) includes practically
every country in the world. At its
congress, held in Copenhagen in 1950,
its president Folke Regard, could
rightly say :"We may hold different
political conceptions, but in our in-
ternational chess activities we are
not subject to any political pre-
judices. Between the chess players
of the world there also exists a deep
friendship that is completely free
from all political conceptions and
ideologies. We are convinced that
in reality the same friendship exists
between all men.
"We hope that the leaders of all
countries will realise that the
greatest desire of their people is for
peace in their own time and security
for future generations, and that the
leaders can meet in the same spirit
as that which presides at the
meetings of players and organizers
of chess games."
The chess sets and the chess
pieces which are reproduced on
these two pages and on the last page
of the Courier are taken from the
magnificent collection obtained by
M. Jean Maunoury, of France, from
almost every country in the world.
The photographs of these objects
are printed here with the kind per-
mission of M. Maunoury. His col-
lection is one of the most famous
of its kind in existence in the world.
