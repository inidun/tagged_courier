### 61092: The Odyssey of the human conscience

THE ODYSSEY
OF THE HUMAN
CONSCIENCE
The demand for human rights is so long-standing and so profound,
' the violation of human rights has been so ruthless and so wide¬
spread in recent times and is still so prevalent today, that we are not entitled
to rest on our laurels. The battle is raging on several fronts, in many parts
of the world, and the news reaching us is far from being only news of
victory.
I sometimes wonder whether the main thing was not and is
not, now more than ever to probe deeper for a better understanding ;
and, to that end, to awaken or accustom the mind to the very thought
of human rights, which is by no means as instinctive and familiar as
people think, or often pretend to think.
I t is, in any case, a fact that we have seen precious words impov-
erished over the years through being uttered mechanically,
without reference to their spiritual roots. And now, today, we find that
human rights are in danger of losing their prestige and their power of
inspiration, even before they have been completely assimilated and made
a reality.
In certain countries and some circles, there are people who say
that human rights have become meaningless, lifeless, in a revolutionary
age where it seems normal to sacrifice the justice and happiness of today
to the virtue and prosperity of tomorrow. Others aver that human rights
are devoid of substance in a technological civilization, where produc¬
tivity is the supreme value and where the two crucial problems are increas¬
ed production and distribution of goods. Others, again the apocalyptic
or the indifferent simply proclaim the end of the human race, even its
non-existence, and in any case the end of humanism. Let us take heed;
man is no longer much in fashion among the leaders of the nations, the
technocrats and the know-it-alls of our planet.

HUMAN
RIGHTS
	 TOMORROW by Hanna Saba
Assistant Director-General of Unesco
Í
4
VERY day we hear with growing concern of new acts committed
in open violation of human rights and disregard for human dignity. The
countless victims of these acts are not only men and women whose
rights are denied them, systematically or unwittingly, by their own govern¬
ments. In many instances, violations of human rights are the direct or
indirect consequence of war or of the "military actions" which some states
feel obliged to take in defence of their interests. The full development
of the individual human being, with due respect for the rights which
safeguard human dignity, would appear to be incompatible with the
defence by states of what they consider to be their supreme national
interests.
The present situation has thus bitter¬
ly disappointed those who believed
that we were close to an era when,
progressing beyond the status of prin¬
ciples proclaimed by international as¬
semblies, human rights would be incor¬
porated in the laws of nations, respect¬
ed by governments, and guaranteed by
the provision of legal recourse to
appropriate national and international
bodies.
Instead, the situation seems to have
justified the pessimism of those who
maintain that human rights have be¬
come meaningless and without value in
an age of revolutionary change such
as that of our present civilization, and
that it is normal to sacrifice the justice
and happiness of today to the virtue
and prosperity of tomorrow.
But these disappointments should
not make us lose sight of the progress
already achieved. The magnitude of
the reactions aroused by violations of
human rights is in itself a reason for
hope and confidence. To condemn a
violation is to recognize a right. And
the depth to which the world's con¬
science is outraged and revolted is a
measure of its attachment to a prin¬
ciple that has been violated.
As the Proclamation of Teheran,
adopted in April 1968 by the Inter¬
national Conference on Human Rights,
has noted, substantial progress has
been made in defining standards for

al of Unesco for International Standards

tions. He was formerly a member of the
Egyptian diplomatic service.
the enjoyment and protection of human
rights and fundamental freedoms since
the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights was adopted in 1948. Important
international covenants defining civil,
political, economic, social and cultural
rights have been unanimously adopt¬
ed by the member states of the United
Nations.
Moreover, while it is true that the
reign of justice is one of man's oldest
aspirations, we should remember that
the Universal Declaration and the co¬
venants, conventions, recommenda¬
tions and declarations that clarify and
implement the principles it proclaims
are new and important developments
in the field of human rights.
We have only to cast back our minds
to the recent past to see how far
the ideas that then prevailed differ
from those now embodied in the Uni¬
versal Declaration. In place of the
principles of equality for all and the
elimination of discrimination of any
kind, notably in terms of race, religion,
sex or social status, which the Decla¬
ration proclaims and which today we
consider as imperatives, ancient, trad¬
itional concepts held sway, based on
a hierarchical system embracing
states, peoples, races and social cate¬
gories, with women in many countries,
accorded the status of a minor, if not
of a slave.
These age-old concepts continue to
influence the minds of many, and a
considerable gap exists between the
"principle" of equality for all before
the law and the "fact" that many
distinctions and discriminations have
survived from ancient times and are
still practiced today.
Furthermore, the individualistic con¬
cept of human rights found in the great
American and French declarations,
from which the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights drew inspiration, does
not always correspond with concepts
of society that are based on the pre¬
eminence of the group.
The governments of certain newly-
independent countries warmly en¬
dorsed rules that should put an end
to the idea of hierarchies of states
and races on which colonialism was
based, but are now finding it extremely
difficult to enforce these rules, largely
because of deep-rooted prejudices
against the idea of equality for women
or because of tribal hatreds which,
even today, result in the massacre of
innocent people.
Similar prejudices have existed for
centuries in other, older states where
two ethnic groups live together only
at the price of the domination of the
one by the other. Even differences in
religion are sometimes the cause of
discrimination, although far less so
than in the past.
F,INALLY and in the pre¬
sent state of affairs this may perhaps
be the most important consideration of
all the ignorance, disease and poverty
which afflict hundreds of millions of
human beings, and the obvious inade¬
quacy of the resources available to
governments to combat these evils,
are preventing entire peoples from en¬
joying the conditions of life com¬
patible with human dignity.
To give reality to human rights is
thus an immensely difficult under¬
taking. It calls for prolonged effort,
and one of the first tasks must be
to educate, to teach, to persuade, to
win over all mankind to believe in
and adhere to principles that may con¬
flict with certain deeply-ingrained ways
of thinking and ways of life, and with
powerful vested interests.
Thus, in order for man to truly in¬
tegrate his freedom and responsibility
in the realities of everyday life, he must

first be liberated from the misery of
hunger and the servitude of ignorance,
so that he may understand the world
around him, communicate with his
fellowmen, and receive, transmit and
compare experience, knowledge and
ideas.
For this he must first be able to
read. Therefore, one of the imperative
tasks in the promotion of human rights
is to free' over seven hundred and fifty
million adult illiterates from the dark¬
ness of ignorance and draw them into
the mainstream of modern life.
But so deeply-rooted is the egoism
challenged by the Universal Declara¬
tion and so powerful are the prejudices,
outmoded traditions and practices it
seeks to eradicate, that the principles
of the Declaration will never become
realities until they are profoundly im¬
planted in the hearts and minds of
each and everyone. The demand for
human rights to be respected must
become so universal, so natural and
so imperative that no authority would
dare to evade its obligations. And to
bring that about, it is vital that the
principles be explained, justified and
taught to all.
From this standpoint, it is far more
important to help people grasp the
general concept of inalienable rights
than to analyze the provisions of any
one right in particular. Above all, we
need to understand and make others
understand that to be effective, respect
for human rights must be unconditional,
absolute.
No reason, be it blatantly bad or dis¬
sembled with false arguments and
there are sometimes honourable rea¬
sons, advanced on patriotic, family,
religious or ideological grounds
should be allowed to prevail against
them. The Idea of a right implies that
it can be claimed unconditionally, and
the concept of respect for every human
being as one In whom that right is
vested inevitably compels us to
acknowledge its universality.
It cannot be repeated too often that
no constraint by force, other than that
of the law, no intimidation, no fear is
compatible with this essential require¬
ment, nor is any system of humiliation
or segregation, nor the reign of chaos
or despotism.
The International Conference on
Human Rights, in Teheran, unanimous¬
ly adopted a resolution on the educa¬
tion of youth in the respect for human
rights and fundamental freedoms, and
urged that this education should be
given to children at an early age. It
called on states to ensure "that all
means of education should be employ¬
ed so that youth grows up and
develops in a spirit of respect for
human dignity and for equal rights of
all men and all peoples without dis¬
crimination as to race, colour, lan¬
guage, sex or faith."
The Teheran Conference also Invited
Unesco "to develop its programmes
aimed at making children aware, from
the time they start school, of respect
for the dignity and rights of man and at
making the principles of the Universal
Declaration prevail at all levels of
education, particularly in institutions
of higher learning where the future
cadres are trained."
Since its inception, Unesco has de¬
voted considerable effort to promoting
the spread of education throughout the
world. It believes a belief with which
all economists concur that education
is not only a basic human right, but
at the same time a prerequisite of
development, which alone will permit
all men to attain human dignity in its
widest sense, by freeing them from the
servitude of poverty.
Unesco believes that education,
which enables everyone to exercise
his rights to the full and gives sub¬
stance and reality to those rights,
should be based on certain fundamen¬
tal ethical principles. Since 1948, when
it met in Beirut, the Unesco General
Conference has urged that the Univer¬
sal Declaration of Human Rights
should be incorporated in all school
teaching programmes and that know¬
ledge and understanding of its prin¬
ciples should be promoted as widely
as possible.
IHE undertaking of so vast
an enterprise obviously requires the
collaboration of all those who can use
their influence to promote its aims,
and in this connexion I would like to
pay tribute to the non-governmental
organizations for the outstanding work
they have accomplished in fostering
civic education.
It Is not only in schools and univer¬
sities that human rights must be taught.
And whether they are concerned with
education itself or with one or another
of the professions, whether they are
striving for improvements In the status
accorded to women or for the protec¬
tion of moral or religious values, these
organizations go directly to the indivi¬
dual, whom they can reach more easily
than intergovernmental organizations
such as Unesco.
These organizations can exert a
decisive influence on public thought
and opinion. In all the countries where
they are active, they can make known
and understood the principles of the
Universal Declaration, and thereby help
to make respect for human rights the
imperative demand of all citizens and
the specific obligation of governments,
in other words, an integral part of
national life in all countries.
The road ahead will doubtless be
long, the difficulties great and the dis¬
appointments many. But hope and
constancy can never fail those who
have faith in Man.
This address was delivered to the Inter¬
national Conference of Non-Governmental
Organizations on Human Rights, held at
Unesco headquarters, In September 1968.

### 59299: The Right to be a man

"Le Droit d'être un Homme "
(The Right to be a Man) is the
title of a book just published
in French by Unesco to mark
the 20th anniversary of the
Universal Declaration of Human
Rights. It is the first book
ever to present on such a
broad canvas and in such
detail a panorama in words
of human beings in every
corner of the world and in
every age asserting and
claiming the right of man
"to be a man". The Unesco
anthology comprises over
1,100 quotations and extracts
from every period between
3,000 B.C. and the mid-
twentieth century. The book
was prepared by the Swiss
philosopher, Jeanne Hersch,
who for the past two years
directed Unesco 's Division of
Philosophy. In the following
article. Miss Hersch looks back
at the centuries-long struggle
for human rights in the light of
modern man's development.
The book is scheduled to be
published in English in
December 1968 under the title
"Birthright of Man" (see
page 35). In this issue the
"Unesco Courier" is pleased
to present a small selection
ofpassages from this unique
work (see page 9).

An elephant which exists is an ele¬

a guinea fowl. To speak of the "right
to be a man", then, means that a
person can exist without being truly a
man, a human being, without even the
possibility of being one.

different from being a member of the
zoological species called "man," as
in the case of an elephant or a guinea
fowl.
To be truly a man Is to make use of
two, quite special abilities: the ability
to think, and the ability to decide, and
by so doing, to participate deliber¬
ately and responsibly in life.
It seems simple. But a great number
of conditions must be fulfilled.
First, in order for man to be able to
think and decide, the primary menaces
which threaten all life hunger, cold,
physical constraint, violent death
must be decreased (they can never
be completely defeated), so that
instead of having to fight for his exis¬
tence, man can begin to think of and
base his decisions on other things.
His mind as well as his body must be
allowed to stand erect, instead of
being forced to remain on all fours,
like an animal.
This implies that man can express
his thoughts and translate his deci¬
sions into action, free from physical
hindrance of any kind, without hand¬
cuffs or other shackles. That he can
make use of his hands, his feet, his
voice, his pen and his other facilities.
For thoughts and decisions that are
not incarnated in the stream of
common experience have the incon¬
sistency of dreams.
I have just used the words "stream
of common experience." For man is
not alone. When he thinks and takes
decisions, it is always as part of the
community of people around him.
He thinks for them, with them, about
them, and in their name, even when
they are not consciously in his mind.
His decisions are shared by his
fellowmen or they are not, but the
community is always involved in the
reasons and consequences of these
decisions. Whether he is aware of
it or not, his fellowmen are always
present in his thoughts and actions (if
only by the fact that he makes use of
language to express himself) and they
are Involved, negatively or positively,
at every moment.
Therefore he must seek out his
fellowmen, compare his thoughts and
deeds with theirs, associate himself
with them so as to improve their
stream of common experience, or
associate himself with certain groups
amongst them in order to resist the
others.
But that is not all. .Neither the
satisfaction of basic needs nor the
absence of physical constraint, nor,
indeed, the free confrontation of ideas
and the free association of thoughts
are enough. Man can neither think
nor act in a vacuum. There must be
some substance that continuously
feeds and nourishes his thoughts and
actions. And he must know the
context in which his thoughts and
actions will be rooted if he is not to
grope blindly, oblivious of the imme¬
diate consequences of his decisions.
The nourishing substance is called
culture. The knowledge of the context
is called information.
And finally, if in our thoughts and
actions we are to resist the many
tensions and burdens of the world
and society, deep inside us there
must be some absolute point at which
we will always draw the line.
The Universal Declaration of Human
Rights the first to proclaim univer¬
sally that the rights of every man,
whoever he may be, must be
recognized plays a direct educa¬
tional role, since it sets down the
basic rules for a universal system of
civic and moral order. It also plays
an indirect role by acting as an ins¬
piration for national and international
legislation in which the general 'princ¬
iples proclaimed in the Declaration
are embodied as concrete, specific
and verifiable regulations that those
who suffer oppression can use to
obtain redress by direct recourse
either to the authorities of their own
country or to the court of world
public opinion.
The importance of this cannot be
overestimated. Yet the precise
wording of the articles of the Declar¬
ation should not blind us to the
historic roots of human rights. These
roots reach far down into the past
and touch the universally voiced
notion of "the right to be a man." It

THE RIGHT TO BE A MAN (Continued)
is from this deep fund that the
Unesco anthology has taken its
sustenance, drawing on the most
diverse sources, across time and
space, of human history.
The anthology contains more than
1,100 fragments culled from every
epoch between 3,000 B.C. and 1948
A.D., the year the Universal Declar¬
ation was adopted. From every
continent, every latitude and longi¬
tude, from fable and tragedy, legis¬
lation and proverb, political treatises
and ritual texts, from funerary in¬
scriptions and popular songs from all
of these come the basic themes indi¬
cated above.
The passages selected are by no
means limited to pious statements of
noble sentiment. Many express the
loud voice of protest or the cry of
revolt of those whose human dignity
has been flouted. Such cries and

protests are proof that the right to be
a man has always existed as mankind's
aspiration and that mankind has
suffered from its violation.
Here, in language and expression
assuming a multitude of forms, there
spreads out before us the broad
canvas of themes which have inspired
the Universal Declaration: the human
person, his relations with his fellow¬
men; the special regard we owe to
the weak: exiles, foreigners, the poor,
the vanquished, women, children, the
infirm; the duties of those in power,
the limits of powers, the conditions
of legitimate rule; civil liberties and
freedom of expression; the association
of liberty and truth; social rights and
individual liberty; education, science
and culture as prerequisites for a
really worthwhile life; force, curbed
or restricted by law; independence
and national identity; the universality
of the "spirit of man" and all it
implies in society's obligation to man;
the interconnexion between rights and
duties. And finally, we see how the
bases and ultimate goals of human
rights have varied: sometimes
compounded with God, then with
Nature, then with abstract principles
and now, in modern times, become
a sort of sphere of the absolute,
without support, poised precariously
on itself.
Thus, in his search for identity across
the ages, man has never ceased to
claim for himself and his fellowmen
the right to fulfil his true vocation.
An aspiration at once so universal
and long-standing poses formidable
problems when confronted with what
our present-day world has to offer.
If the principle of the work contract
with conditions requiring the workers'
consent had already been engraved ;
in stone as long ago as 3,000 B.C.,
whereas today forced labour still
exists, what hopes can we place in a
Declaration of Human Rights? But
on the other hand, if the demand for
these rights has been able to survive
the many ordeals and violations that
mark man's history, what force can
ever stifle it?

who looks sincere seem true, those from an evil face false even though they
be just. We listen to the case of a man of pleasing countenance and believe he has
been persecuted, but hear an ugly man's arguments, and think him wrong.
"And all because, the heart being swayed by what the eyes see, before a
person has even spoken we are already deciding in our hearts that he is criminal,
or virtuous, or upright; and when we hear the pleadings, we often have ample
confirmation of our thoughts. But when it comes to delivering judgement, there
are odious men among' those who appeared likeable, and likeable among
the odious, false men among the sincere, upright among the crooked and
I know not how many morel The heart of man is difficult to fathom, and never
entirely written in the face.
"Formerly, judgement was rendered according to people's colour, their demeanour.
This is possible for.those who are never wrong, but men like Shigemuni are
often deluded by what they see. For not only is everyone frightened if he has
to appear in court, but quite naturally terrified at the sight of the judge who can
have him put to death or let him live; he cannot say what he should, and finds
himself condemned for some felony or misdemeanour. Better, then, that we
should not see each other's faces: and that is why I ordered the separation."
Thus, praying daily to the gods, he would swear to be utterly impartial, and having
set his heart to rights both inwardly and outwardly, he would proceed to hear
cases and deliver his judgements.

Freedom from fear
ATHARVAVEDA
Book XIX, 2200-1800 B.C., India
Anthology translated from the Sanskrit
May the mid-region grant us freedom from fear; may both these, heaven
and earth, [grant us] freedom from fear. May there be freedom from fear
for us from the rear, from the front, from the above, and from the below. May
there be no fear from friend or from foe, from those we know or
from those who are far away. May there be no fear for us by night and
also by day. May all the quarters be friends to me.

De Officiis
Tyranny unthroned
Those who in a free state deliberately put themselves in a position to be feared
are the maddest of the mad. For let the laws be never so much overborne by
some one individual's power, let the spirit of freedom be never so intimidated,
still sooner or later they assert themselves either through unvoiced public
sentiment, or through secret ballots disposing of some high office of state.
Freedom suppressed and again regained bites with keener fangs than freedom
never endangered.

How Don Quixote
liberated the farmer's servant
Don Quixote and Sancho Panza
Picasso (1955)

Don Quixote had not gone far, when out of a thicket on his right there seemed
to come feeble cries as of someone in distress, and the instant he heard them
he exclaimed, "Thanks be to Heaven for the favour it accords me, that it so
soon offers me an opportunity of fulfilling the obligation I have undertaken,
and gathering the fruit of my ambition. These cries, no doubt, come from some
man or woman in want of help, and needing my aid and protection"; and
wheeling, he turned Rosinante in the direction whence the cries seemed to proceed.
He had gone but a few paces into the wood, when he saw a mare tied to an
oak, and tied to another, and stripped from the waist upwards, a youth of about
fifteen years of age, from whom the cries came. Nor were they without cause,
for a lusty farmer was flogging him with a belt and following up every blow
with scoldings and commands, repeating, "Your mouth shut and your eyes openl"
while the youth made answer, "I won't do it again, master mine; by God's
passion I won't do it again, and I'll take more care of the flock another time."
Seeing what was going on, Don Quixote said in an angry voice, "Discourteous
knight, it ill becomes you to assail one who cannot defend himself; mount your
steed and take your lance" (for there was a lance leaning against the oak to
which the mare was tied), "and I will make you know that you are behaving as
a coward."
The farmer, seeing before him this figure in full armour brandishing a lance over
his head, gave himself up for dead, and made answer meekly; "Sir Knight, this youth
that I am chastising is my servant, employed by me to watch a flock of sheep that
I have hard by, and he is so careless that I lose one every day, and when I punish
him for his carelessness and knavery he says I do It out of niggardliness, to

escape paying him the wages I owe him, and before God, and on my soul he lies."
"Lies before me, base clown!" said Don Quixote. "By the sun that shines on us
I have a mind to run you through with this lance. Pay him at once without another
word; if not, by the God that rules us I will make an end of you, and annihilât«
you on the spot; release him instantly."
The farmer hung his head, and without a word untied his servant, of whom Don
Quixote asked how much his master owed him.
He replied, nine months at seven reals a month. Don Quixote added it up,
found that it came to sixty-three reals, and told the farmer to pay it down
immediately, if he did not want to die for it.
The trembling clown replied that as he lived and by the oath he had sworn (though
he had not sworn any) it was not so much; for there were to be taken into
account and deducted three pairs of shoes he had given him, and a real for two
blood-lettings when he was sick.
"All that is very well," said Don Quixote; "but let the shoes and the blood-lettings
stand as a set-off against the blows you have given him without any cause; for
if he spoiled the leather of the shoes you paid for, you have damaged that of
his body, and if the barber took blood from him when he was sick, you have drawn
it when he was sound; so on that score he owes you nothing."
"The difficulty is, Sir Knight, that I have no money here; let Andres come home
with me, and I will pay him all, real by real."
"I go with him!" said the youth. "Nay, God forbid! no, Señor, not for the world;
for once alone with me, he would flay me like a Saint Bartholomew."
"He will do nothing of the kind," said Don Quixote; "I have only to command,
and he will obey me; and as he has sworn to me by the order of knighthood
which he has received, I leave him free, and I guarantee the payment."
"Consider what you are saying, señor," said the youth; "this master of mine is
not a knight, nor has he received any order of knighthood; for he is Juan Haldudo
the Rich, of Quintanar."
"That matters little," replied Don Quixote; "there may be Haldudos knights:
moreover, everyone is the son of his works."
"That is true," said Andres; "but this master of mine of what works is he the
son, when he refuses me the wages of my sweat and labour?"
"I do not refuse, brother Andres," said the farmer; "be good enough to come along
with me, and I swear by all the orders of knighthood there are in the world to
pay you as I have agreed, real by real, and perfumed (that is, completely)."
"For the perfumery I excuse you," said Don Quixote; "give it to him in reals,
and I shall be satisfied; and see that you do as you have sworn; if not, by
the same oath I swear to come back and hunt you out and punish you; and I
shall find you though you should lie closer than a lizard. And if you desire to
know who it is lays this command upon you, that you may be more firmly bound
to obey it, know that I am the valorous Don Quixote of La Mancha, the undoer
of wrongs and injustices; and so, God be with you, and keep in mind what you have
promised and sworn under those penalties that have been already declared to you."
So saying, he gave Rosinante the spur and was soon out of reach. The farmer
followed him with his eyes, and when he saw that he had cleared the wood and
was no longer in sight, he turned to his boy Andres, and said, "Come here, my
son, I want to pay you what I owe you, as that undoer of wrongs has
commanded me."
"My oath on it," said Andres, "your worship will be well advised to obey the
command of that good knight may he live a thousand years for, as he is a
valiant just judge, by Roque, if you do not pay me, he will come back and do as
he said."
"My oath on it, too," said the farmer; "but as I have a strong affection for you,
I want to add to the debt in order to add to the payment;" and seizing him by the
arm, he tied him up to the oak again, where he gave him such a flogging that
he left him for dead.
"Now, Master Andres," said the farmer, "call on the undoer of wrongs; you
will find he won't undo that, though I am not sure that I have quite done with
you, for I have a good mind to flay you alive as you feared." But at last he untied
him, and gave him leave to go look for his judge in order to put the sentence
pronounced into execution.
Andres went off rather down in the mouth, swearing he would go to look for the
valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha and tell him exactly what had happened,
and that all would have to be repaid him sevenfold; but for all that, he went
off weeping, while his master stood laughing.

### 59299: The Right to be a man

"Study of a helmet"
by Albrecht Dürer
(1514)
JOSÉ MARTI
Cuba
The Golden Age, 1889
The fury of liberty deprived
Freedom is the right of every man to be honest, and to think and speak without
hypocrisy... Certain men can live happily without honour; others suffer terribly
when they see that those around them lead dishonourable lives. .In this world,
there has to be a certain amount of light, just as there has to be \a certain
amount of honesty. Whenever there are many men without honesty, there are
always others who preserve in themselves the honesty of many men put together.
These are they who rebel with terrible fury against those who take away the
freedom of a nation, which is to rob men of their honesty. In these men are
contained thousands and thousands of men; a whole people is contained in them,
indeed, the whole of human dignity: such men are sacred.
When I remember, my heart is heavy
1GNACY KRASICKI
Poland
Fables. 1779
"Tell me," the young finch said to the old, "Why do you sigh?
This cage where we live is a very fine place." "Oh! it's where you were born,
so it seems so to you, but it doesn't to me, alas, I remember that once I was free,
and. that's why I sigh."
JOSEPH, NEZ PERCÉ INDIAN CHIEF
North America
19th century
The Earth is the mother of all, and all ought to possess equal rights to her
benefits. It is like expecting rivers to flow uphill to imagine that a man who
was born free can be happy when he is confined to a given area and freedom
to go wherever he fancies is taken from him. An Indian whose movements are
restricted to a narrow piece of land will not be happy, and will not be able to
develop or prosper. When I think of the conditions under which we have to live,
my heart is heavy within me.

Suffocating nightmare
The centralized State apparatus, with its complicated and ubiquitous military,
bureaucratic, clerical and judicial organs, coils about the living body of civil
society like a boa constrictor... All even the minor interests resulting from
the relations between the various social groups were severed from society
itself, made Independent thereof, and set against it in the guise of the State's
interest, administered by the priests of the State divinity (Staatspriester): the
hierarchy of the officials... All revolutions without exception have merely perfected
this State machine instead of getting rid of this suffocating nightmare.

The majority must prevail.
In addition to the existing ten Commissioners, the people shall elect twenty
others among citizens over forty years of age who, after swearing that they
will draw up the measures they consider best for the State, shall draft the public
safety proposals. Any other citizen may also make proposals, so as to ensure
that the one chosen is the best possible.

When civil disobedience becomes a duty
The practical reason why, when the power is once in the hands of the people,
a majority are permitted, and for a long period continue, to rule is not because they
are most likely to be in the right, nor because this seems fairest to the minority, but
because they are physically the strongest. But a government in which the majority
rule in all cases cannot be based on justice, even as far as men understand it.
Can there not be a government in which majorities do not virtually decide right and
wrong, but conscience?...
The mass of men serve the state thus, not as men mainly, but as machines,
with their bodies. They are the standing army; and the militia, jailors, constables,
posse comitatus, etc. In most cases there is no free exercise whatever of the
judgement or of the moral sense; but they put themselves on a level with wood
and earth and stones; and wooden men can perhaps be manufactured that
will serve the purpose as well. Such command no more respect than men of
straw or a lump of dirt. They have the same sort of worth only as horses and
dogs. Yet such as these even are commonly esteemed good citizens.
Others as most legislators, politicians, lawyers, ministers, and
office-holders serve the state chiefly with their heads; and, as they rarely make
any moral distinctions, they are as likely to serve the Devil, without intending it,
as God. A very few, as heroes, patriots, martyrs, reformers in the great sense,
and men, serve the state with consciences also, and so necessarily resist it for the
most part; and they are commonly treated as enemies by it...
How does it become a man to behave toward this American government today?
I answer, that he cannot without disgrace be associated with it. I cannot for
an instant recognize that political organization as my government which Is the
slave's government also.
All men recognize the right of revolution; that is, the right to refuse allegiance
to, and to resist, the government, when its tyranny or its inefficiency are great
and unendurable. But almost all say that such is not the case now. But such
was the case, they think, in the Revolution of 75. If one were to tell me that
this was a bad government because it taxed certain foreign commodities brought
to its ports, it is most probable that I should not make an ado about It, for
1 can do without them. All machines have their friction...

are organized, I say, let us not have such a machine any longer. In other words,
when a sixth of the population of a nation which has undertaken to be the refuge
of liberty are slaves, and a whole country is unjustly overrun and conquered
by a foreign army, and subjected to military law, I think that it is not too soon
for honest men to rebel and revolutionize. What makes this duty the more urgent
is the fact that the country so overrun is not our own, but ours is the invading
army...
Unjust laws exist: shall we be content to obey them, or shall we endeavour to
amend them, and obey them until we have succeeded, or shall we transgress them
at once? Men generally, under such a government as this, think that they ought
to wait until they have persuaded the majority to alter them. They think that,
if they should resist, the remedy would be worse than the evil. But it is the
fault of the government itself that the remedy is worse than the evil. It makes
it worse. Why is it not more apt to anticipate and provide for reform? Why does
it not cherish its wise minority? Why does it cry and resist before it is hurt?
Why does it not encourage its citizens to be on the alert to point out its faults,
and do better than it would have them?...
Under a government which imprisons any unjustly, the true place for a just man
is also a prison.

If I considered only force and the results that proceed from it, I should say that

that, as soon as it can shake off the yoke and does shake it off, it does better;
for, if men recover their freedom by virtue of the same right by which it was
taken away, either they are justified in resuming it, or there was no justification
for depriving them of it.

SIMON BOLIVAR
Speech to the Assembly of Angostura
Venezuela, February 15. 1819
Nothing is more dangerous than to leave power in the hands of one citizen for
a long period. The population gets accustomed to obeying him, and he to
ordering it about, whence spring usurpation of power and tyranny-
Good habits, and not force, are the pillars of law and justice; and the exercise
of justice is the exercise of freedom...
Many nations, both in the past and in the present, have thrown off the yoke of
oppression; but only very few of them have known how to enjoy a few precious
moments of freedom. All too quickly they have fallen back into their ancient
vices; for it is peoples themselves, rather than their governments, which drag
tyranny in their wake... Only democracy, in my opinion, is capable of providing
absolute freedom. But where is the democratic government that has managed
to combine at a given moment power, prosperity and permanency?
If only.

And now I shall tell a tale to kings, wise though they may be. Thus spoke the
falcon to the speckled-throated nightingale as he bore him aloft amidst the clouds,
impaled on his cruel talons. The nightingale groaned piteously and the falcon said
roughly: "Wretched creature, why are you complaining? You have fallen
to someone far stronger than yourself. You will go wherever It pleases me
to take you, sweet songster though you be, and I shall choose to eat you
or to set you free. He who resists one more powerful than himself is insane; he
cannot win, and suffering is added to his shame." Thus spoke the swift falcon,
soaring proudly with wings outstretched...
But you, Perses, hearken to Justice. Do not allow extravagant thoughts to
grow within you. Immoderation is an evil thing for poor people; even the great
find it hard to support and the burden of it crushes them on the day when they
run into adversity. Far better ¡s the road which goes the other way and leads to
works of Justice.
For you, Perses, take this advice to heart; listen well to Justice and put violence
aside forever.

proclaimed in the Universal Declaration are unfortunately
too often ignored when they are not openly violated or trampled
underfoot . . . The Universal Declaration does not reflect the realities
of our world today, nor is it the proclamation of a state of affairs
which individuals and nations alike can be proud of. It is the public
and universal recognition of a duty that devolves on all of us,
confronted by a world of violence, misery and injustice. The Declaration
alone will not eliminate these evils, but through it are revealed sharply
the torment of our world and the determination of the many to put
an end to the multitude of abuses that mark our contemporary history."

The individual and truth
HENRY DAVID THOREAU
United States of America
Civil disobedience, 1849
Is a democracy, such as we know it, the last improvement possible in government?
Is it not possible to take a step further towards recognizing and organizing
the rights of man? There will never be a really free and enlightened State until
the State comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent power,
from which all its own power and authority are derived, and treats him accordingly.
I please myself with imagining a State at last which can afford to be just to all
men, and to treat the individual with respect as a neighbour; which even
would not think it inconsistent with its own repose if a few were to live aloof from
it, not meddling with it, nor embraced by it, who fulfilled all the duties of
neighbours and fellowmen. A State which bore this kind of fruit, and suffered it to
drop off as fast as it ripened, would prepare the way for a still more perfect
and glorious State, which also I have imagined, but not yet anywhere seen.
RUSSIAN PROVERB Truth is stronger than strength.
The law of the tiger
VOLTAIRE
France
Treatise on Tolerance, 1763
The natural law is the law directed to all men by nature. You have brought up
your child: he owes you respect as his father and gratitude as his benefactor.
You are entitled to the produce of the land you have cultivated with your hands.
You have made and received a promise; it must be kept.
Human law can have no other foundation than this law of nature; and the great,
the universal principle of either, throughout the Earth is: "Do not unto others
what you would not have them do unto you." Now, by this principle, how
can one man say to another: "Believe what I believe, and believe what you
cannot believe, or you shall die." Yet this is what they say in Portugal, in
Spain and in Goa. In certain other countries, they are, for the present, content,
to say merely: "Believe, or I will loathe you; believe, or I will do you all the harm
I can; monster, your religion is not mine, so it is no religion at all; you shall
be held in loathing by your neighbours, your town, your province."
If human law were to operate thus, then the Japanese should detest the Chinese,
and they the Siamese; the Siamese should persecute the inhabitants of the
Ganges and they would fall upon the inhabitants of the Indus; a Mogul would
tear out the heart of the first Malabar to cross his path; Malabars would slit
the throats of Persians, and Persians would massacre Turks; and all together
would fling themselves upon Christians, who have for so long devoured each other.
The law of intolerance is therefore absurd and barbarous; it is the law of the
tigerand yet more horrible, since tigers only rend each other's flesh for food
whilst we have exterminated one another for a paragraph.
The four freedoms
20 FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT
United States of America
"Four Freedoms" speech, January 6,
1941
We look forward to a world founded upon four essential human freedoms.
The first is freedom of speech and expression everywhere in the world.
The second is freedom of every person to worship God in his own way
everywhere in the world.
The third is freedom from want which, translated into world terms, means
economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime
life for its inhabitants everywhere in the world.
The fourth is freedom from fear which, translated into world terms, means a
world-wide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion
that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against
any neighbour anywhere in the world.
That is no vision of a distant millenium. It is a definite basis for a kind of world
attainable in our own time and generation.

the maximum number of nationals are citizens in the true sense . . . For a small
State has nothing else save this real and effective freedom, which fully offsets the
advantages of a large State.

Adrift in a climate of suspicion...
Secret denunciations are evidently abusive but are sanctioned and made
necessary in many nations by the weakness of their constitutions. It is a practice
which makes men false and dissembling. He who suspects another of
informing sees in him an enemy. Thus he becomes accustomed to masking
his own feelings and, by dint of hiding them from others, he ends up hiding
them from himself. Woe to men who have reached this point; lost and adrift
without firm or clear principles upon the vast sea of opinion, always in fear of
the monsters which threaten them. They cannot enjoy the present, for it is
always poisoned by uncertainty for the future. Deprived of the lasting pleasures of
peace of mind and security, the few happy moments scattered here and there
in their sad lives and used up in haste and confusion hardly console them for
having lived . . .
Who can defend himself against calumny when it is armed with the strongest
shield of tyranny, secrecy? What sort of government can it be where he
who governs sees an enemy in each of his subordinates and thinks himself
obliged to take away the peace of mind of each one of his subjects in order to
ensure the peace of mind of all?
MARIANO MORENO
On Liberty of Authorship
Gaceta de Buenos Aires, 1810
Truth and virtue, contain within them their own best defence; discussion and
debate reveal them in all their splendour and brilliance; if discourse is restricted,
mind will vegetate like matter; and error, falsehood, prejudice, fanaticism and
brutishness will divide the peoples and will cause forever their abasement,
ruin and destitution.

From the speech in defence

a seditious libel, January 29, 1794
Censorship the means that do not justify the end
What calamities are the people saved from, by having public communication
left open to them? I will tell you, gentlemen, what they are saved from, and what
the government is saved from; I will tell you, also, to what both are exposed by
shutting up that communication ... If you doubt of the horrid consequence
of suppressing the effusion even of individual discontent, look to those enslaved
countries where the protection of despotism is supposed to be secured by such
restraints. Even the person of the despot there is never in safety. Neither
the fears of the despot nor the machinations of the slave have any slumber the
one anticipating the moment of peril, the other watching the opportunity of
aggression. The fatal crisis is equally a surprise upon both: the decisive
instant is precipitated without warning by folly on the one side, or by frenzy
on the other, and there is no notice of the treason till the traiter acts.
. . . The press extinguished, the people enslaved, and the prince undone! As the
advocate of society, therefore of peace of domestic liberty and the lasting
union of the two countries I conjure you to guard the liberty of the press,
that great sentinel of the state, that grand detector of public imposture; guard
it, because, when it sinks, there sinks with it, in one common grave, the liberty
of the subject and the security of the Crown.

EMANUEL ARNOLD
Czech writer
The Interim Law of the Press, 1849
The only valid account of this interim law on the press which we can offer is that
it has been enacted in order as an interim measure to teach writers to hold
their tongues, and, after they have mastered this task within the interim period,
to become dumb once and for all.
If while this law is in force Czech writers still want to advocate the truth in every
respect, they will have to be as intrepid as Jan Zizka, for this law threatens
to put the writer into the dock even for a word.
Editors would do well to petition the government for permission to move their
furniture straight away into jail and conduct editorial work there. Failing this, and
assuming a political journal of a limited size, some four editors would be required:
two to serve the sentences, the third to sit in the dock, and the fourth to do the
actual editing. But the fourth would have to refrain from having a drink
of champagne, lest a spark of the French spirit be lit in his veins, for in that case
twice the number would not suffice to conduct the paper. Besides, the publisher
would have to possess several gold mines to pay the fines from profits. An editor
who is not a mere figurehead and carries the flame of love for humanity in his
heart would hardly ever be available in his office but would be found frequently
in jail, where, if tanned by the sun of liberty, he would have an opportunity to
bleach his skin.
The writer could not utter a single word against oppression by the lackeys of the
mighty, unless he wanted to hear the grating of the prison door. Every political
treatise he wrote would be but a pinch of dust, which a foreign writer, living
in freedom, could blow away with a single breath. This would, of course, scarcely
benefit the common people, and as a result the nation may sink again into darkness.
But since our people, as is generally known, have a passion for politics and
a passion for truth, they cannot be expected to put up with such a state of affairs.

Debates on the Freedom of the Press
Rheinische Zeitung, 1842
The true censorship that which is based upon the very essence of the freedom
of the press is criticism; that is the court before which the freedom of the
press has elected to be tried...
Censorship itself admits that it is not an end in itself, that there is nothing
intrinsically good about it, that it is founded on the principle that the end
justifies the means. But an end which has need of unjust means is not a just end.
. . . The writer in no way considers his works as a means. They are ends in
themselves: he is so far from regarding them as a means, for himself or for
others, that, if necessary, he will sacrifice his existence to their existence and,
much like the religious preacher, will lay down the principle that "it is better to
obey God than men" those very men among whom he none the less
belongs by his human needs and desires . . . The first freedom for the press
consists in not being an industry. The writer who so lowers the press
as to use it as a material means, deserves as punishment for such lack of
inner freedom, to lose his outer freedom by censorship. More accurately,
indeed, his existence is already his punishment.
Man is not free by print alone
ALEXANDER HERZEN
1812-1870, Russia
Letters
People imagine that it is enough to demonstrate the truth, like a mathematical
theorem, to have it accepted; that to believe in it oneself is enough to make
others believe in it. In fact, however, it is not at all like that: some people say
something, others listen to them and understand something else, because they
are not at the same stage of development. What did the first Christians preach,
and what did the multitude understand? The multitude understood everything
that was incomprehensible, absurd and mystical; everything that was clear
and simple was inaccessible; the multitude accepted everything
that fettered the conscience but nothing which set man free. Similarly, later
on, it understood revolution solely as a bloody execution, a guillotine, a vengeance;
a bitter historical necessity became a shout of triumph; with the word "fraternity"
was coupled the word "death;" "fraternity or death" became a sort of
"your money or your life" of the terrorists. We have experienced so much
ourselves, we have seen so much and, what is more, our predecessors have
experienced so much for us, that in the end it has become unpardonable for us
to let ourselves be carried away, to believe that to make known the Gospel
to the Roman world is enough to turn it into a democratic social republic, as the red
apostles believed; or that it is enough to publish a two-column illustrated
edition of the Rights of Man for man to become free.

Against the ten thousand faces of servitude
ANTON CHEKHOV
Gooseberries, 1898
Silent protest
We neither see nor hear those who suffer, and the tragedy of life takes place
behind the scenes. All is quiet, all is peaceful; only statistics make their silent
protest: so many people went out of their mind, so many gallons were drunk,
so many children starved to death . . . And, of course, such a state of affairs
is necessary; of course, those who are happy feel comfortable only because those
who are unhappy bear their burden in silence; if they did not, nobody would
be happy. It is a sort of communal hypnosis.
On every contented, happy man's doorstep there should be someone with a hammer
in his hand, who would keep reminding the happy man by his knocking, that there
are unhappy people in the world, and that, however happy he may be, sooner
or later life will show him its talons, and misfortune will befall him, in the form
or sickness, poverty or loss, and no one will see him or hear him, just as today
he neither hears nor sees others.

Children of darkness
The mine delivers its gang and the pit its bondsmen . . . troops of youth alas!

are the mothers of Englandl But can we wonder at the hideous coarseness
of their language when we remember the savage rudeness of- their lives?
Naked to the waist, an iron chain fastened to a belt of leather running between
their legs clad in canvas trousers, English girls, for twelve, sometimes for sixteen
hours a day, on hands and knees haul and hurry tubs of coals up subterranean
roads, dark, precipitous, and plashy: circumstances that seem to have escaped
the notice of the Society for the Abolition of Negro Slavery. These worthy
gentlemen too appear to have been singularly unconscious of the sufferings
of the little Trappers (children who open and shut the traps), which is remarkable,
as many of these unhappy children are in their employ.
See too these emerge from the bowels of the earth! Infants of four and five
years of age, many of them girls, pretty and still soft and timid; entrusted with
the fulfilment of most responsible duties, and the nature of which entails of them
the necessity of being the earliest to enter the mine and the latest to leave it.
Their labour indeed is not severe, for that would be impossible, but it is passed
in darkness and in solitude. They endure that punishment which philosophical
philanthropy has invented for the direst criminals, and which those criminals
deem more terribhe than the death for which it is substituted.

Hour after hour elapses, and all that reminds the infant Trappers of the world

The massacre of the innocents
JONATHAN SWIFT
Ireland
A modest proposal for preventing the
children of poor people in Ireland from
being a burden to their parents and for
making them beneficial to the public,
1729
It is a melancholy object to those who walk through this great town, or travel in the
country, when they see the streets, the roads, and cabin doors, crowded with
beggars of the female sex, followed by three, four or six children, all in rags,
and importuning every passenger for an alms. These mothers, instead of being
able to work for their honest livelihood, are forced to employ all their time
in strolling to beg sustenance for their helpless infants; who, as they grow up,
either turn thieves for want of work, or leave their dear native country to fight
for the Pretender in Spain, or sell themselves to the Barbadoes.
I think it is agreed by all parties that this prodigious number of children in the arms,
or on the backs, or at the heels, of their mothers and frequently of their fathers,
is in the present state of the kingdom a very great additional grievance; and
therefore whoever could find out a fair, cheap and easy method of making these
children useful members of the commonwealth, would deserve so well of the public,
as to have his statue set up for a preserver of the nation.
But my intention is very far from being confined to provide only for the children
of professed beggars; it is of a much greater extent, and shall take in the whole
number of infants at a certain age who are born of parents in effect as little able
to support them as those who demand our charity in the streets . . .
I shall now therefore humbly propose my own thoughts, which I hope will not be
liable to the least objection.
I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London,
that a young healthy child, well nursed, is at a year old a most delicious,
nourishing, and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked or boiled;
and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricassee or ragout.
I do therefore humbly offer it to the public consideration that of the 120,000 children
already computed, 20,000 may be reserved for breed, whereof only one-fourth
part to be males; which is more than we allow to sheep, black cattle, or swine;
and my reason is that these children are seldom the fruit of marriage,
a circumstance not much regarded by our savages, therefore one male will
be sufficient to serve four females. That the remaining 100,000 may, at a year old,
be offered in sale to the persons of quality and fortune through the kingdom;
always advising the mother to let them suck plentifully in the last month, so as
to render them plump and fat for a good table. A child will make two dishes
at an entertainment for friends; and when the family dines alone, the fore or hind
quarter will make a reasonable dish, and, seasoned with a little pepper or salt,
will be very good boiled on the fourth day, especially in winter . . .
After all, I am not so violently bent upon my own opinion, as to reject any offer,
proposed by wise men, which shall be found equally innocent, cheap, easy and
effectual ... I desire those politicians who dislike my overture, and may perhaps
be so bold as to attempt an answer, that they will first ask the parents of these
mortals, whether they would not at this day think it a great happiness to have been
sold for food at a year old in the manner I prescribe, and thereby have avoided
such a perpetual scene of misfortunes as they have since gone through the
oppression of landlords, the impossibility of paying rent without money or trade,
the want of common sustenance, with neither house nor clothes to cover them
from the inclemencies of the weather, and the most inevitable prospect of entailing
the like or greater miseries upon their breed forever.

If I were born a woman...
KEMAL PASHA ATATURK

The contempt in which we have. held our women, this is the explanation for the
failure of our social system. Destiny meets out our alloted span of life, but it is
activity that alone gives life its meaning. And if, in any social organism, only
a part of the members are active while the rest do nothing, then that organism
becomes paralyzed. If a social organism is to move ahead and attain its goals
it must fulfil specific obligations and leave nothing to chance. If, then, our society
has need of science and technology, such knowledge must be acquired by men
and women alike, on equal terms and for identical reasons. For, as we all know,
the dominant fact of life and of every field of endeavour is that efforts must be
shared. Within this sharing out of work, women must accomplish the tasks
that fall to them, but these tasks must include full participation in the activities
that make for the well-being and happiness of all.
Housework is the least imperative and the least important of women's social duties.

If I were born a woman, I would rise in rebellion against any pretension on the part
of man that woman is born to be his plaything. I have mentally become a woman
in order to steal into her heart. I could not steal into my wife's heart until
I decided to treat her differently than I used to do, and so I restored to her all her
rights by dispossessing myself of all my so-called rights as her husband.
I realized that the wife is not the husband's bondslave, but his companion and
his helpmate, and an equal partner in all his joys and sorrows as free as the
husband to choose her own path.
Equality in all respects
THOMAS MORE
England
Utopia, 1516
This wise sage, to be sure, easily foresaw that the one and only road to the general
welfare lies in the maintenance of equality in all respects. I have my doubts
that the latter could ever be preserved where the individual's possessions are his
private property. When every man aims at absolute ownership of all the property
he can get, be there never so great abundance of goods, it is all shared by a handful
who leave the rest in poverty. It generally happens that the one class
pre-eminently deserves the lot of the other, for the rich are greedy, unscrupulous,
and useless, while the poor are well-behaved, simple, and by their daily industry
more beneficial to the commonwealth than to themselves ... I admit that this
burden can be lightened to some extent, but I contend that it cannot be removed
entirely. A statute might be made that no person should hold more than a certain
amount of land and that no person should have a monetary income beyond that
permitted by law. Special legislation might be passed to prevent the monarch
from being overmighty and the people overweening; likewise, that public offices
should not be solicited with gifts, nor be put up for sale, nor require lavish
personal expenditures.
PEDRO CIEZA DE LEON
Spanish chronicler of Peru
16th century
Public welfare under the Incas
. . . Such fear was there of the princes that, in so vast a land, every people was
as orderly and well-governed as if the Lord were present to punish any who
did contrary. That fear was issue of the lords' own worth and of their justice,
it being known that if they should perchance do evil, the chastisement of those
who did so did immediately follow, neither prayers nor bribes availing. And as
always the Incas acted well towards those placed under their dominion, not
permitting that they be oppressed, nor too much tribute taken from them, nor other
injustice done to them, besides which, many with barren provinces in which their
forefathers had lived in need were commanded that they should be made fertile
and abundant and were provided with those things that there were lacking;
and to others that lacked clothing because they had no flocks, it was commanded
that flocks should be generously given. In short, it was known that, just as these
lords would be served by their people, who paid tribute to them, so too did they
preserve their lands for them, raising them from ignorance to great skill, and from
being indigent to lacking nothing.
A vision of man triumphant
MAXIM GORKI
U.S.S.R.
Vladimir l/yich Lenin, 1920
How does Lenin see the new world?
Before me, a marvellous vision of the earth ... All men are reasonable, each feels
personally responsible for all that is done by and around him. In the garden-cities
majestic buildings rise; the forces of nature, tamed and marshalled by his
intelligence, are everywhere working for man; and he himself at last! is really
master of the elements. His physical energy is no longer spent on heavy, dirtying
work but made over to the spirit, and entirely concentrated on life's great
problems . . .
Technically bettered, socially enhanced, work is becoming his pleasure. Really free
at last, his reason has become the most precious thing in the world and truly
fearless . . .
I do not believe I am attributing dreams to Lenin that are foreign to him, or that
I am romanticizing this man I cannot imagine him without this splendid dream
of future happiness for all men, of happy, joyous life. The greater the man,
the more audacious his dreams.

The causes that estrange men from one another are principally three: 1. differences
of opinion: we are not able to think of the same things in the same way: 2. hatreds:
we cannot admit differing opinions about the same things without friendship
suffering as a result. Hence, we cannot differ in our opinions without developing
impassioned and prejudiced feelings one against another; 3. open wrongs and
persecutions: which are the results of our hates, to our mutual undoing.
The first conflict originates in the mind, the second in the will and In the feelings,
the third in those secretly or openly opposing forces which make for mutual

Civitas gentium
IMMANUEL KANT
German philosopher
Eternal Peace, 1795

The idea of the law of nations, understood as implying the right to make war,
is really inconceivable (since this would mean the right to decide what is just,
not according to external laws, universally applicable and limiting the freedom
of each individual, but by force and according to subjective maxims). It is
inconceivable unless we take it to mean that men of such a turn of mind are
fully entitled to destroy one another and find eternal peace in the vast grave-mound
that is heaped over them with all the horrors of violence. To the reasonable
mind, there is no other way in which States maintaining reciprocal relations
can escape from lawlessness, the source of declared wars, than by renouncing,
as individuals, their primitive (anarchical) freedom and adapting themselves to the
public constraint of laws, and thus form a "State of Nations" (civitas gentium)
which, growing freely and steadily, would finally be extended to embrace all

Peace of Europe, 1692
Peace is maintained by justice, which is a fruit of government, as government
is from society, and society from consent.
Now if the sovereign Princes of Europe, who represent that society, or independent
state of men that was previous to the obligations of society, would, for the same
reason that engaged men first into society, viz. love of peace and order, agree
to meet by their stated deputies in a General Diet, Estates, or Parliament, and
there establish rules of justice for sovereign princes to observe one to another...
and thus to meet yearly, or once in two or three years at farthest, or as they
shall see cause, and to be styled the Sovereign or Imperial Diet, Parliament, or
State of Europe...
The place of their first session should be central, as much as is possible,
afterwards as they agree before which sovereign assembly, should be brought
all differences depending between one sovereign and another, that cannot be
made up by private embassies, before the sessions begin;... and that if any
of the sovereignties, that constitute these Imperial States, shall refuse to submit
their claim or pretensions to them, or to abide and perform the judgment thereof,
and seek their remedy by arms, or delay their compliance beyond the time
prefixed in their resolutions, all the other sovereignties, united as one strength,
shall compel the submission and performance of the sentence, with damages to
the suffering party and charges to the sovereignties that obliged their submission.

THE RIGHT TO BE A MAN (Continued)
The cats and the ratsa Somali folk tale
.
Illustration for La Fontaine's Fables
engraved by Jean Ignace Grandville
It is said that the Cat clan once had a meeting. The purpose of the meeting was
to make a decisive attack against the Rat clan. The meeting was chaired by the
King of the Cat clan. When the meeting was convened and everybody* was .
present, the King spoke and said: "O Cat clan, greetings. Today we are assembled
here because, as you all know, the Rat clan has been having a prosperous year.
The world has been good to them. Their numbers have multiplied and they have
grown very fat. We, on the other hand, have been suffering from famine. We
are all thin and weak. Therefore, O clansmen, we must think of a way to catch
all the Rats in order to fatten ourselves on their juicy flesh. How shall we go
about it?"
An old wise Cat then took the floor. He said: "Long live the King! I have a
suggestion to make. I suggest that we trick the Rat clan into making a solemn
pledge of peace with us. We should call for an inter-clan peace conference. The
meeting should be in a treeless plain where the Rat clan would have no shelter;
and then it would be quite easy for us to catch them all."
The suggestion of the old, wise Cat was received with enthusiasm. The King
of the Cats spoke again. He said: "Old one, may your wisdom live long! You
have offered a wise suggestion. I will now go and inform the King of the Rats
about this offer of peace, and I will try to secure his approval. Await news from
me." All the Cats then cheered: "Long live the King!" And the meeting broke up.
The King of the Cats then went to the King of the Rats. Since there was
no love lost between the two clans, and since they could not trust each other at that
time, they had to speak to each other from a distance.
The King of the Cats spoke: "O King of the Rats; O symbol of freedom; O wisest
of all sages; may you live long! Peace be with you. How are you?"
The King of the Rats then came out and said: "O King of the Cats; O tree whose
shade covers all: O judge of the world; O shelter from evil; may peace be with
you. How are you?"
The King of the Cats, coming directly to the point, said: "I bring peace. I come
to make a proposal to you and your subjects on behalf of my subjects and
myself. As you know, the Cat clan and the Rat clan have always been enemies.
This hostility has harmed both you and us. Our continuous practice of killing
you has reduced your number. We, on our part, have suffered from the hunt.

that peace would be the best thing. We now officially call for a meeting
between us on the Plain of Dirindiir. There we shall solemnly pledge peace,
and we shall be true brothers. We propose that the meeting should take
place on the day after the full moon, at mid-morning."
The King of the Rats then responded: "Long live the King! We have officially

LTHOUGH women have made encouraging pro¬
gress in their quest for equal rights with men, there are
relatively few nations even among the so-called developed
countries where their sex is no longer a factor in deter¬
mining their position in society. Where mankind has been
only too eager to embrace new ideas and approaches in
other matters, when it comes to human rights it still often
clings to anachronistic concepts which do not, in fact
never did, correspond to reality.
The Declaration on the Elimination of Discrimination
against Women, adopted by the United Nations one year
ago, and reaffirmed at the International Conference on
Human Rights in Teheran in April this year, is by the
necessity of its existence an indictment against the
injustices which continue to be inflicted upon women.
Implicitly calling the world's attention to the laws,
customs, regulations and practices which still discriminate
against women, it urges their complete abolition, and the
establishment of effective legal protection for equal rights
of men and women.
By stipulating the need for full political rights for women
to be guaranteed in law, it is at the same time a reminder
and a rebuke to countries whose women are denied voting

received this proposal. We agree to the day you have picked for the meeting.
Let us hope for a conference of peace."
The King of the Cats then left. When His Majesty was out of sight, the King
of the Rats called his subjects. He said: "The King of the Cats came to me.
He talked to me about peace, and he suggested that we enter into a pledge
of peace with them. I have accepted this offer. The meeting is to be held at
the treeless Plain of Dirindiir. I cannot break my word. You know it is not
a noble thing to do so. Therefore, we have to go and meet them. However, we
cannot trust the Cat clan. Experience teaches us so. What shall we do?"
Then an old sage among the Rats spoke: "I suggest that every Rat should
dig himself a deep hole at Dirindiir before the day of the meet. When the
appointed day comes, we should all go there in the early morning, and every
Rat should remove the soil from the hole to a far place so as to avoid suspicion.
Then every Rat should sit at the edge of his hole. If the Cat clan comes
in peace, it is well and good. But if, as we expect, they attack us, then
every Rat should immediately retreat into his hole."
This advice was accepted, and they all dispersed. Every Rat then went to the
plain and dug himself a hole, disguised its mouth, and removed the soil.
The day of the meeting came. The Rat clan went early to the Plain of
Dirindiir, and every one of them sat at the edge of his hole. At mid-morning
the Cat clan, expecting a feast, presented themselves. When they were near
enough to be heard, the King of the Cats surveyed his subjects and asked
them to sit down, because he did not want the Rat clan to be suspicious.
And then he called to the King of the Rats and said: "Great King of the Rats,
are all your subjects present?"
The King of the Rats replied: "Yes, they are. Are all your subjects here too?"
Confirming this, the King of the Cats then said: "O King, I shall now inform
my subjects of the protocol of the meeting. Please wait." Saying this, he
turned and looked critically at his clan. Being satisfied with their state of readiness
for the assault, he turned once more in the direction of the Rat clan. He
saw how the Rats were all fat and had had a good year. He saw the King
of the Rats showing every sign of the affluence of his race in his abundant
flesh. He decided to attack him personally. He then raised his voice in the
battle cry of the Cats and called to his army: "Catch them all. Let no one escapel"
When the King of the Rats saw them charging, he stood on his tiny hind legs
and called to the members of his clan: "Clansmen, into your holes dive!"
In a second they were all in, and there was no trace of them.
The Cat clan therefore not only had no succulent feast that day; but what
is worse, they suffered the disgrace of breaking a solemn promise. The
Cats forgot the Somali proverb that says "Tab hayow lagaa tab hayee"
(O you, who think yourself clever, remember that there is always someone
cleverer still).

### 61051: Men, women: new letters of credit

rights, to hold public office or exercise public functions.
In many areas, women who marry citizens of another
country are forced to take their husband's nationality, or
become stateless; inequalities in civil law often prohibit
them from acquiring, administering, and inheriting property;
the difference in the status of husbands and wives remains
an almost implacable obstacle to equal rights; and the
practices of child marriage and the betrothal of young
girls is still common in certain countries. In enumerating
these abuses, the Declaration on the Elimination of Dis¬
crimination against Women lays down positive guidelines
for their removal.
Because there are legal and traditional barriers still
blocking women from exercising their right to an education,
and thus diminishing their contribution to society, equal
rights are imperative at all levels of education, including
equal opportunities to benefit from scholarships and grants.
Even basic requirements like the right to participate in
adult literacy programmes are often denied them.
Progress has, of course, been made in the field of
education. But as educational opportunities become more
extensive, enabling women to acquire greater knowledge
and skills, safeguards must be instituted to ensure that
they can enter professional and business life on a basis
equal to men.
The Declaration insists that strong measures must be
taken wherever women do not have free choice of
work, equal pay for equal work, discrimination on account
of marriage or maternity (such as dismissal from work due
to maternity) and insufficient social benefits.
Against the background of International Year for Human
Rights, 1968, the Declaration on the Elimination of Dis¬
crimination against Women stands out as a major Instru¬
ment in the struggle to secure the rights and freedoms of
all human beings.
United Nations Secretary-General U Thant, in his
address to the international non-governmental organizations
at their recent conference on human rights at Unesco
headquarters in Paris, said "The discriminations against
women which still persist, the "incapacities" of women,
whether political, legal, social or economic, are unlikely
to be overcome without the active co-operation' of men
and women who must join in persuading governments and
society to assure the advancement of women to full
equality, and to enable women to participate fully in the
development and progress of their nations."

Letters to the Editor
HUMAN RIGHTS IN PRACTICE
Sir,
My favourite reading ¡n the "Unesco
Courier" are the articles that give one
a better understanding of other peo¬
ples and their ways of life, and also
those that deal with major world prob¬
lems. But it seems to me that you
are overcautious (vis à vis the coun¬
tries contributing to Unesco's budget)
inasmuch as you cite noble principles,
yet pass over questions such as Viet
Nam, Biafra, the Kurdish problem,
Israel, Czechoslovakia, etc. I agree
it is far easier to speak of things in
abstract terms, but the true meaning
of human rights is to be found in real
life situations. Bravol nevertheless,
for your indictment of racism in
South Africa. Keep it up.

NOISE ANDTRAFFIC PROBLEMS
OF ANCIENT ROME
Sir,
Your reader Ludwig Börnstein, of
Tel-Aviv (January 1968 issue), rightly
supports his contention that "the noise
nuisance is already of long standing"
by a quotation from- the Roman poet
and satirist Juvenal, who was deriding,
in his own fashion, the impossibility
of rest and sleep in Rome owing to
the abominable noise from rolling
wagons, mingled with the hoarse
shouts of cattle drovers in the night.
Caesar decreed that no wheeled
vehicle should enter Rome between
sunrise and sunset, a drastic but ap¬
parently successful step because the
law was copied by other cities of the
Roman Empire and maintained long
after Caesar's assassination.
Before he issued the decree, Rome
during the day was choked with wag¬
ons, chariots, cattle, thousands of
pedestrians, military patrols, etc., so
that the entire commercial life of the
city was coming to a standstill. To
relieve this situation, Caesar kept the
streets free for pedestrians in the
daytime by forcing wagons to travel
at night hence the broken rest of the
unhappy inhabitants!
In "Daily Life in Ancient Rome",
(published in England by Routledge
and Sons, 1941) Jerome Carcopino,
director of the Ecole Française de
Rome, and member of the Institut de
France, writes: "From sunrise until
nearly dusk, no transport cart was
henceforward to be allowed within the
precincts of the Urbs. Those which
had entered during the night and had
been overtaken by the dawn must
halt and stand empty."
I feel the concluding sentence of the
author to this particular chapter is
also worth noting:
"And suddenly in the twinkling of
an eye they are transformed [i.e. the
day-time streets and their hubbub] by
a logical and imperious decree, swiftly
imposed and maintained generation
after generation, symbol of that social
discipline which among the Romans
compensated for their lack of tech¬
niques, and which the West today,
oppressed by a multiplicity of discov¬
eries and the complexities of progress,
is for its salvation striving to imitate."
The Romans, always so practical,
made an earnest attempt to solve the
traffic problem while we are still
talking about itl

IN THE LAND OF THE ATOM
Sir,
Congratulations on your first-rate
number, "Peaceful Uses of the Atom"
(July-August 1968). People need to
be shown that atomic energy is not
necessarily a force for man's de¬
struction, but, on the contrary, that it
can serve many peaceful ends.
Many persons still equate nuclear
research with only one result nuclear
explosions. This, as you have shown,
is not the case, since nuclear research
has had applications in many fields,
from sterilization of medicines and
gauging the thickness of paper to the
dating of archaeological remains by
means of radioactive çarbon-14.
I enjoyed reading "Charting the
Nuclear Labyrinth" by I.H. Usmani and
"Twilight Lives of Man-Made Atoms"
by Georgi Flerov and Vladislav Kuz-
netsov, and in particular the cartoon-
feature, "Sophie and Bruno in the Land
of the Atom" which, I am sure, also
initiated many adults into the principles
of atomic power. To include such a
clear and easily understood text was
an excellent idea.

AUSTRALIA'S
DWINDLING KANGAROOS
Sir,
There may yet be time to avoid a
national tragedy in Australia if action
is taken to halt the slaughter of the
kangaroo, which has been hunted to
the very brink of extinction by pur¬
veyors of pet foot and fur products.
The kangaroo's destruction is ab¬
solutely unjustified: his meat, because
of its parasitic content, is not healthy
pet food, and its export value is negli¬
gible; he is not a pest and does not
compete with sheep for forage; and
he is not numerous. Two million kan¬
garoos are being slaughtered every
year. Three species have already been
wiped out and a fourth, the Big Red
kangaroo, has been reduced by almost
75 per cent in the last ten years.
All people, everywhere, who care
about preserving the kangaroo from
extinction should appeal to both their
own governments and to the Australian
state governments for an immediate
ban to be placed on the ruthless
slaughter of this dignified, docile and
defenceless animal, one of the living
wonders of the world.

A PAGE FOR YOUTH
Sir,
Why not devote a page each month
to youth? It could become a forum
where young people would air their
views on current problems and topics
(some suggested by you). An ex¬
change of ideas between students
would interest many people. Perhaps
you could also devote space each
month to facts about one or other of
the careers open to young people on
completing their studies. I know
many other student readers of your
magazine who agree with me.

HUMAN RIGHTS YEAR
AND WORLD PEACE
Sir,
The cover photo caption of your
issue on International Year for Human
Rights (January 1968) states: "When
the founding fathers of the United
Nations drew up the U.N.'s Charter
at San Francisco in 1945, they estab¬
lished in the very first paragraph of
the Preamble their fundamental ob¬
jective: 'to save succeeding, gener¬
ations from the scourge of war." But
how do things look today, when we
think of what has happened in Viet
Nam, Tibet, Israel and other places?
Where is the fundamental right for all
men and nations to enjoy a peaceful
existence, free from constant threats
of war? The right of women the
world over no longer to see their
sons, husbands and brothers shed
their blood in senseless wars? What
do the much discussed human rights
mean when even this, the most funda¬
mental of them all, cannot be achieved?

VIVISECTION OVERLOOKED
Sir,
Your issue on World Health Tomor¬
row (March 1968) discussed medical
experimentation on man, but said
nothing about vivisection a closely
related problem. In my view, you
should make good this omission in a
future issue.

From the Unesco Newsroom...
Nobel Peace Prize
for French jurist
The Nobel Peace Prize, for 1968 has been
awarded to Mr René Cassin, the distin¬
guished French jurist, for his work as vice-
president of the U.N. Commission on
Human Rights, which drew up the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights adopted in
1948, and for his efforts during the past
20 years to promote respect for human
rights in Europe and throughout the world.
Mr Cassin took part in the preparatory
meeting in 1944 which led to Unesco's
foundation, and was French representative
to the United Nations from 1946 to 1958,
during which he became president of the
U.N. Commission on Human Rights (see, the
"Unesco Courier", January 1968). He
recently retired from the presidency of the
European Court of Human Rights.
Get 'Help'
Voluntary organizations in the U.K. have
set up a non-profit making trust, the Com¬
munity Publications Group, to publicize the
social problems they are tackling and to
encourage people to take a hand in volun¬
tary work. Its first major project is "Help",
a new illustrated magazine presenting news
"of every group trying to build a better
community." "Help" (subscription £2.2.0.)
is sold by volunteers so that the 25 per
cent distribution "profit" will go to a volun¬
tary organization of the subscriber's choice.

Unwary workers

More accidents at work occur on the day
after the weekend rest than at any other
time, possibly because workers have not
adjusted themselves to the normal working
routine, reports the Hadassah-Hebrew
University Medical Centre, in Israel. Other
findings from the centre's studies: men are
more accident-prone than women, as are
employees aged over 55 in comparison
with younger workers.
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi
Prize for literacy work
The Brazilian Movement for Fundamental
Education, an organization which operates
a radio-school network for adults in the
less-developed rural areas of Brazil, has
been awarded the 1968 Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi Prize for work in literacy. The
$5,000 annual prize, donated by the Shah-
inshah of Iran, was awarded at a cere¬
mony in Unesco H.Q., Paris, during the
celebration of the second International
Literacy Day, on September 8, 1968.
Push-button fishing
Crewless fishing boats which can cruise
and catch fish under remote control from
a mother ship miles away are being de¬
signed in the Soviet Union for an expanded
fisheries programme. Vessels would carry
electronic gear for detecting fish at depths
of up to 2,500 feet.
Imperishable literature
A new line of books, which it is claimed
are practically ¡ndestructable, or at least
child-proof, are being produced for very
young readers in Britain. The books are
printed on plastic pages too strong for
children to tear. Crayon, pencil and food
marks can be washed off, and the books
are nonflammable and non-toxic.
Diagnosis by radio
Doctors in remote areas of Latin America
will soon be able to send electrocardio¬
grams by shortwave radio for expert pro¬
cessing in the U.S.A. Through Project
Med-Aid (Medical Assistance for Isolated
Doctors), electrocardiograms will be trans¬
mitted to the computer-complex of Duke
University in the United States, thousands
of miles away, for study and analysis by
specialists whose findings will be sent
back to the doctor on the spot. Med-Aid
has been on the air for over two years,
and more than 320 calls for specialist advice
have been answered.
Temples of Abu Simbel
dedicated on new site
The new site of the Abu Simbel temples
was inaugurated before representatives of
40 nations and 12 international organiza¬
tions on September 22. The dedication
ceremony marked the completion of a four-
year, $36 million salvage task during which
the 3,200 year-old Nubian monuments were
dismantled and re-erected on a plateau
200 feet above the original site. The rescue
of the temples from inundation by waters
of the Nile rising behind the new Aswan
High Dam is one of the achievements of
the Unesco sponsored International Cam¬
paign to Save the Monuments of Nubia,
launched in 1960.
Computer-minded museums
The first conference on the, use of com¬
puters in museums to detect art forgeries,
classify archaeological findings, and analyze
artistic content was held recently at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.
One museologist described how "pictures"
of ancient Egyptian pottery, written with an
electronic "light pen", can be stored in a
computer's memory. The pictures can then
be compared on a screen with other im¬
ages and analyzed statistically and visually.
Flashes,..
Over 450 nuclear reactors now operate
in the research centres or electric power
plants of 48 countries, according to the
International Atomic Energy Agency.
The world has more than 246,000 cine¬
mas, well over 8,000 TV transmitters and
over 17,000 radio stations reports the latest
edition of the Unesco Statistical Yearbook.
A permanent European Youth Centre
will be opened in Strasbourg next year by
the Council of Europe.
The recent Unesco-sponsored confer¬
ence on the Application of Science and
Technology to the Development of Asia has
urged Asian countries to spend at least
one -per cent of their annual Gross National
Product on research and development
before 1980.
Peru has been the world's top fishing
nation since 1962 with an annual catch of

RENE MAHEU
re-elected
Director-General
of Unesco
Mr. René Maheu, Director-General
of Unesco since 1962rwas unanimous¬
ly re-elected to a six-year term of
office, on October 19, 1968, by the
Unesco General Conference, meeting
in Paris. It is the first time that a
Director-General of Unesco has been
re-elected to a second term. Mr. Maheu,
who is French, joined Unesco in 1946.
He was appointed Assistant Director-
General in 1954, and Deputy Director-
General in 1959.
In his address to the General
Conference following his re-election,
Mr. Maheu reviewed the new prob¬
lems that now confront Unesco, and
outlined the ways in which the organ¬
ization would meet them. "The state of
the world gives us cause for concern,"
he said, "and in some respects does
not favour the success of our enter¬
prises. Too often, the peoples are
witnessing, either helplessly or even
willingly, a general weakening of their
leaders' determination to solve the
problems of mankind with the methods
and ethics of international co-opera¬
tion. This demands renewed firmness
and resolution on the part of the inter¬
national organizations.... One day, no
doubt," Mr. Maheu added, "nations
will realize that what must be changed
is the organization of the world Itself...
Until that day comes, and in the pres¬
ent circumstances, continuity is of
paramount importance to Unesco. But
this continuity will not be immobility."
Mr. Maheu then recalled Unesco's
four main tasks: the elimination of illi¬
teracy, the renovation of education, the
implantation of science and the re¬
newal of culture, which, he said, would
be pursued with the same vigour as
in the past.

### IGNORE

THE MIND INDOMITABLE
"Know that your authority extends only upon the
bodies of your subjects, and that kings have no power
over their hearts. Know that while you may have
dominion over men's worldly goods, you will never
subjugate their minds. "
Advice to rulers, attributed to the Sassanian king
Ardashir I, 3rd century, Persia
