With deft and telling brush strokes, a 16th century
Japanese Buddhist priest, Shugetsu, executed this
painting, "Rain", using the "ink-splash" technique in
which forms are created from the chance configuration
of freely spattered ink. Shugetsu was the disciple of
the great Japanese priest-painter Sesshu and accom¬
panied his master on a trip to China in 1468. He died at
the age of 70 in 1520. The compression of form, the
allusive poetry, the delicate balance of lines and space,
characteristic of much of Japanese painting came as a
revelation to European artists of the 19th century, parti¬
cularly the impressionists, and has since had a marked
influence on Western modern art (see page 28).

which ended Japan's isolation and led to rapid modernization
of the country. This event is being commemorated by Unesco

E ARLY in 1868 a young man
whom the world was to know as the
Emperor Meiji emerged into history
from behind the curtain of courtiers
and ceremony that had for centuries
isolated the Japanese throne.
For more than 200 years Japan had.
remained a closed country, ruled by
Shoguns (military governors) who had
reduced the emperor to a figurehead.
Kl KIMURA is one of Japan's foremost
authorities on the history of the Meiji era.
Historian and novelist, he is president of
the Meiji Culture Research Association and
was formerly cultural adviser to the Tokyo
Metropolitan Government. Among his many
books on cultural and historical questions
are "Emperor Meiji" and "A Study In the
Cultural Intercourse between Japan and
U.S.A."
But by the middle of the 19th century
this self-enforced isolation of Japan
suddenly came to an end. Besieged
by foreign powers clamouring for the
country to open up to Western com¬
merce, and threatened by rebellious
.feudal lords,- the fifteenth Tokugawa
Shogun yielded power to the Imperial
house.
The youthful Meiji Emperor, Mitsu-
hito, and his dynamic advisers open¬
ed Japan not only to Western ideas
and commerce but to all the tempest¬
uous currents of the 19th century
world. The Meiji Restoration exactly
one hundred years ago was like the
bursting of a dam behind which had
accumulated the energies and forces
of centuries. Japan set out to achieve
in only a few decades what had taken
Photos Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Japan
centuries to develop in the West: the
creation of a modern nation, with
modern industries and political institu¬
tions, and a modern pattern of society.
Young Samurai changed their Japan¬
ese dress for top hats and dark suits
and sailed off to Europe and America
to study Western techniques of
government, industry and war. In a
tour de force of modernization, the
Meiji revolutionaries raised their
country to be a peer of the Western
powers, in less than 40 years and
without sacrificing Japan's traditional
culture.
The events leading to the Restora¬
tion started the year after- Meiji was
bom, when Commodore Matthew
Perry's "Black Ships" from the United
States steamed into Kurihama Bay in

EMPEROR MEIJI (Continued)
From national
seclusion to
doors open
on the world
1853 on a mission of diplomacy and
commerce.
After Perry signed a treaty of amity
with the Shogun the next spring,
Russia, the Netherlands and Great
Britain secured similar agreements.
Hermit-Japan, after secluding itself for
over 200 years, slowly began to
resume contact with the outside world.
6
HEN Japan re-opened its
doors, it was stagnating under a feudal
system which had divided society into
four distinct castes: warriors, farmers,
artisans and tradesmen. So all-per¬
vasive was this caste system that it
exercised control over the very lives of
the people to the extent of prescribing
exact rules on all activities relating to
daily life and behaviour. Even the use
of language, both written and spoken
was determined by the individual's
social class.
The Confucian ethic, with its em¬
phasis on the practice and cultivation
of the cardinal virtues of filial piety,
kindness, righteousness, propriety,
intelligence, and faithfulness, consti¬
tuted the foundation on which all
relations between superiors and in¬
feriors, one's obedience to authority,
and the concept of master-servant
were formalized. Society was stable,
but totally immobilized.
The Japan of those days was more¬
over an impoverished agrarian state.
Even in the late 1870s, some 75 to
80 per cent of the employed popula¬
tion were engaged in agriculture. Per
capita annual income was estimated
at about 65 dollars. In other words,
Japan was a nation sustained by a
farming community working at a bare
subsistence level.
Right from the time of Perry and
the first treaties the Japanese were
interested in international relations on
the basis of independence and equal¬
ity. There was a danger, they felt,
that the Great Powers might dominate
them, and a way of thinking, not in
terms of the clan but in terms of the
state, was born from this feeling.
The confrontation between groups
advocating an open-door policy and
those who urged the exclusion of
foreigners was, for a time, bitter. Both
factions had the same goal: to pre¬
serve national independence. When
the champions of seclusion realized
that this freedom could be maintain¬
ed only through intercourse with
foreigners, they made common cause
with their former opponents.
Conflict also arose over whether
Japan should return political power to
the throne or continue the traditional
Shogunate system of government.
Again, national independence was the
determining factor.
In 1867, both the Shogun and Em¬
peror Komei, Meiji's father, died. The
young Emperor and the new Shogun,
Yoshinobu were duly installed in the
highest offices of the land.
Yoshinobu was a man of vision, con¬
vinced that Japanese Independence
hinged on the country being unified and
modernized. In late 1867, encouraged
by a coalition of fiefs led by the strong
provincial clans known as the "Satcho
Dohi," he surrendered his authority
to the Emperor and ended 700 years
of military rule.
In February 1868, the Reformation
began: Emperor Meiji assumed su¬
preme executive authority, and inform¬
ed foreign representatives that his
title should replace the Shogun's in
all existing treaties.
Encouraged by his counsellors,
many of whom he chose from the
Samurai, Japan's warrior class, Meiji
broke the strict prohibition which
barred foreigners from the capital,
Kyoto, and received the represen¬
tatives of the Great Powers in a New
Year's audience. He also cast away
the feudal edict against travel, and
journeyed the 27 miles from Kyoto
to Osaka to attend a naval review.
H IS major step in the first
year of the Reformation came when he
summoned his nobles to the royal
palace and,, in their presence, took
the "charter oath" by which he prom¬
ised that a deliberative assembly
would be formed, all classes would
share in the government, and that
justice, not ancient custom, would in
future be the guiding principle of the
administration.
In the same year, he separated
Japan further from its past by moving
the capital from Kyoto to Edo and
renaming it Tokyo, or Eastern Capital.
In the beginning, the Reformation's
leaders devoted almost all their
energies to developing a sound econ¬
omic base for the new state: the
monetary system had to be stabilized,
taxes levied, new industry developed,
and foreign markets opened.

THE GREAT
SHRINE
In 1868, Emperor Meiji
transferred Japan's capital
from Kyoto to the city of
Edo which was renamed the
Eastern Capital (Tokyo).
There, in 1920, the people of
Japan raised the Meiji Jingû
(Meiji Shrine) to the memory
of the great Emperor-reformer.
Left, the morning ceremony
at the shrine. People in
their thousands come to pay
homage every day and
especially on feast days
(right). Surrounding the
imposing edifice are splendid
gardens and thickly wooded
grounds planted with
hundreds of thousands of
trees from all over Japan.
Within the gardens is the
Meiji Art Gallery in which
hang paintings, by leading
Japanese artists depicting
the great events of Emperor
Meiji's reign.
One prerequisite change was the
abolition of the feudal system which,
with autocratic chieftains governing
and levying taxes over huge estates,
stood squarely in the way of econo¬
mic progress. No central government
could effectively unify Japan if it
continued to exist.
Feudalism had been a way of life
since the 12th century, and the clans
were strong. Yet such was the spirit
of the times that the four great Sat-
cho Dohi clans of the west returned
their estates to the Emperor in 1869,
and entreated him to re-organize them
under a uniform set of laws. The
lesser clans soon followed, and be¬
tween 1871 and 1872 the four classes
of warrior, artisan, farmer and trades¬
man were abolished.
The most important factor in Jap¬
an's economic development was a
strong and integrated control by the
central government. This strength was
needed to enforce three difficult deci¬
sions made in the first half of Meiji's
reign, and which were to have endur¬
ing effects on Japan's prosperity.
First, the government resisted the
temptation to unite the country through
foreign military adventures. Six years
after the young Emperor took power,
strong members of the government
favoured going to war with Korea
after Korean shore batteries had fired
on a Japanese gunboat. Despite the
fact that such action would have tem¬
porarily unified the country, which was
plagued by discontented elements at
the time, the proposal was rejected
in 1873, and the nation's energies were
turned to solving domestic problems.
The second decision was to deflate
the economy in 1881. Serious infla¬
tion at that time made it difficult to
promote modern industry and invest¬
ment. Disregarding public dissatis¬
faction, the Meiji government firmly
introduced stringent fiscal measures
that halted inflation in 1884, with the
result that the economic goals set in
1868 were achieved in 1885, as
planned.
T
HE third decision concern¬
ed the financing of new industry. The
Meiji leaders avoided the comparatively
easy solution of allowing foreign in¬
vestment, reasoning that ¡t might make
Japan dependent on foreign nations.
Instead, they raised the necessary
funds by instituting a land tax. Invest¬
ment from abroad was restricted.
Meiji Japan built its modern indus¬
try on a traditional foundation. Raw
silk and tea were the original main
stays of Japan's exports, and these
were encouraged (even the Empress
set up a cocoonery in the palace
grounds to promote sericulture) be¬
cause their foreign exchange earning
power helped establish new industries.
Hokkaido, then a vast virgin island
at the north of the Japanese archi¬
pelago, was opened up with American
assistance (see page 62). Agriculture
and Japan's chemical industry (today
the second in the world) were started.
Apple trees, never before seen in Ja¬
pan, were planted, and the first dairy
industry was begun.
After seeing its success in the West,
the Meiji leaders believed firmly in
private enterprise. But centuries of
feudalism had left the country with few
industrial traditions or skills, and Japan¬
ese investors were cautious about
risking their capital in new and some¬
times strange ventures.
To foster industrial growth, joint-
stock companies were encouraged,
with emphasis on foreign-exchange
firms, trading companies and transpor¬
tation companies; government sub¬
sidies were granted to key businesses
and industries, and favourable tax
concessions made.
The government also built model
factories in the steel, cement, plate-
glass, firebrick, woollen textiles and

EMPEROR MEIJI (Continued)
Far-sighted leader
of a peaceful revolution
spinning industries. They were set up
on a profit-making basis but with the
primary aim of introducing European
production methods and techniques
into Japan.
In all its efforts to modernize indus¬
try, the Reformation leaders were
aided and encouraged by Emperor
Meiji who travelled throughout the
islands, inspecting shipyards, opening
factories, and visiting development
areas.
Reforms in other fields were far-
reaching : education was made com¬
pulsory, all restrictions were lifted on
Japanese going abroad, Christianity
was permitted, vaccinations, postal
service, telegraphs, and steamships
were introduced, torture was abol¬
ished, European dress was prescribed
for officials (with the Emperor showing
the way by adopting Western military
dress), and European and American
advisors were freely employed.
Great efforts were made in the field
of education; the government knew
that for Japan to be wealthy and
strong, the intellectual level of the
people had to be raised. The Japanese
appetite for knowledge had already
been whetted under the Tokugawa
Shoguns when private temple schools
flourished, and the study of Western
science, primarily in the medical field,
was pursued through Nagasaki, the
only city open to foreign trade.
Before the Reformation, education
had progressed to the point where
50 per cent of the male population
and 15 per cent of the female popu¬
lation had received some formal
instruction.
A
8
policy of equal opportu¬
nity was established in Meiji Japan. To
draw gifted students from poor homes,
education was made free at military
academies and teacher training
schools and colleges.
Western learning was introduced
with the approval of the Emperor who
himself had studied Occidental books,
notably Johann Bluntschli's "Allge¬
meines Staatsrecht", a work on poli¬
tical science used by German, French
and British universities at that time.
In 1890, the Emperor ordered that
the guiding principles of school educ¬
ation be compiled in an "Imperial
Rescript on Education". It enjoined
all students to honour their ancestors,
respect their parents, be loyal to
superiors and serve their country.
That the educational policy was
successful can be seen from the fact
that by 1885, 42 per cent of the
students at Tokyo Imperial University
were commoners compared to 25 per
cent in 1878, and at the end of the
Meiji era, primary school attendance
was 95 per cent.
This love of learning of the Japan¬
ese people, coupled with an academic
level which was extremely advanced,
although limited to a narrow sphere,
provided the conditions necessary,
once Western instruction was intro¬
duced, to bring about an amazing dis¬
semination of general education, and
produced scholars of international
calibre.
Dr. Hideyo Noguchi, who was des¬
tined to become a world-famous bac¬
teriologist in tropical diseases, started
from humble beginnings as the son of
a very poor farmer. Other distin¬
guished scientists of the Meiji era were
Jokichi Takamine who synthesized
adrenalin, Shibasaburo Kitazato who
isolated the gangrene bacteria, and
Kiyoshi Shiga who isolated the dysen¬
tery germ.
Japan's modernization was carried
out to counter the impact of the West,
and the much needed reforms were
mainly instituted by the strong central
government. Yet, those outside the
government, including its critics, also
worked effectively for Japan's renewal.
For example, Yukichi Fukuzawa, a
pioneer educator, in expressing his
opposition to the tendency toward an
increasing governmental predomin¬
ance, established Japan's first private
institution of higher learning, Keio
University. Nevertheless, he was
always concerned with the indepen¬
dence of the state and, as an educator,
he worked for its betterment by
increasing the capabilities of his fellow
Japanese (see page 12).
Emori Ueki, a prominent liberal poli¬
tician, was another example of "crea¬
tive opposition". While severely criti¬
cizing the authoritarian Meiji govern¬
ment by preaching freedom and
equality, he declared that any person
who did not extend his capacities and
utilize his talents was failing the nation.
Taisuke Itakaki, another liberal of
the Reformation, was tireless in his
efforts to persuade the government to
institute a deliberative assembly, and
in 1881 it issued an edict declaring
that a national parliament would be
established in 1890 with the inter¬
vening nine years to be devoted to
government preparations for an orderly
change.
Hirobumi Ito, one of the statesmen
who played a major role in reshaping
Japan, was sent to Europe in the same
year to study Western governments,
and determine which one should serve
as the model for Japan. After evalu¬
ating the American, British, and
French systems, he chose the Imper¬
ial German constitution as best suited
for Japan's needs. It provided for an
elected assembly, but made the
government responsible to the throne.
In 1889, Emperor Meiji promulgated the
new constitution, and one year later
the legislature was convened.
P,
ARALLEL to governmental,
social and industrial progress, the Jap¬
anese took on the considerable task
of persuading their foreign treaty part¬
ners to revise the terms of their
agreements. The existing treaties,
which favoured the foreign signatories
with low import duties (mostly five per
cent), and gave their citizens exemp¬
tion from Japanese law courts, had
been signed under vastly different
conditions.
It took 11 years for Japan to get
the terms it wanted. The break came
when Great Britain finally agreed to
a new treaty abolishing extra-terntor-
iality, and giving Japan the right to
set its own import tariffs. Similar
treaties with other countries were soon
concluded, and the Emperor fixed 1899
as the year that they would come into
force.
During this time, foreign wars had
been avoided, but in 1894-1895, Japan
declared war on China over Korea and
defeated the Chinese on the battle¬
field. In 1904 hostilities broke out with
Russia, Japanese troops entering Man¬
churia. A peace treaty was signed the
following year.
During the remainder of Emperor
Meiji's reign, Japan moved within the
circle of great powers consolidating
its position as a vital component of
international politics and trade.
On July 30, 1912, Emperor Meiji died
at the age of 59. Under him, Japan
had emerged from behind the ritual
screen that had shielded It from the
rest of the world to become the leading
power in Asia and a peer of the West.
The revolution that Meiji presided
over was even more remarkable in that
it was orderly and controlled, and
enhanced the monarchy rather than
destroyed it, a result mainly due to the
capable leaders who, in this period of
"Enlightened Rule", shaped the new
Japan.

THE SPIRIT Landscape gardening in Japan is a subtle,
creative art whose history goes back
1,400 years. Throughout that period it has'
retained a characteristic unifying concept.
Like Japanese painting, the Japanese gar¬
den seeks to express the essence of
nature rather than to represent nature
itself. Flowers figure little in its compo¬
sition, which is dominated by the use of
rocks and natural stone. The impression
of infinite space offered by the coastal
landscape on the island of Honshu (above),

for instance, is recaptured with skill and
artistry within the narrow confines of the
garden seen below, itself an archipelago
of rocky islands set in an ocean of gravel.
Symbolically, a vessel in stone (left of

life. Kenzo Tange's modern garden

Hall, evokes the same feeling of the sea,
with its waters lapping the pebbled beach
against a background of terraced cement,
recalling Japan's ricefields.

IN TWO DAYS AND NIGHTS
by Yukichi Fukuzawa
In the middle of the 19th century, a bitter controversy raged
in Japan whether to reject all things Western or to adopt
Western science and ideas. Outstanding among the men
who supported the introduction of Western ways was
Yukichi Fukuzawa (1835-1901), an outstanding scholar of
Chinese, Dutch and English. Fukuzawa visited Europe
and America and gained firsthand knowledge of Western
customs and institutions. He wrote voluminously on the
subject for 30 years. He started a newspaper which
became one of the great Tokyo dailies. He founded a
school which is now Keio University. All this is delightfully
told in his "Autobiography" which appeared in 1899, two
years before his death. We publish here a section from
the chapter entitled "Student Ways at Ogata School," in
"The Autobiography of Yukichi Fukuzawa" translated by
his grandson, Eiichi Kiyooka, and published by Columbia
University Press, New York and London, 1966, in the
Unesco Collection of Representative Works.

GATA Sensei was a doc¬
tor to Lord Kuroda of Chikuzen, the
grandfather of the present nobleman
of that name. It was not that he went
to Chikuzen or to Yedo to serve him,
but he was simply the lord's favourite
doctor in Osaka. Whenever Lord
Kuroda passed through Osaka on his
annual journey to Yedo, Ogata would
present himself to pay his respects in
the feudal headquarters on Nakano-
shima.
One year the third or fourth year
of Ansei (1856-1857) Ogata Sensei
had returned from this visit of state to
his lord when he sent for me in his
own room» and showed me a new
volume of Dutch print.
"Today on my visit to his lordship,
he showed me this book, saying he
had recently acquired it. So I asked
for permission to look it over during
his stay here."
I took in the book with devouring

Vanderbilt (?). The contents seemed
to hold much that was new to us, es¬
pecially the chapter on electricity.
All that we knew about electricity
then had been gleaned from fragmen¬
tary mention of it in the Dutch readers.
But here in this new book from Eur¬
ope was a full explanation based on
the recent discoveries of the great
English physicist, Faraday, even with
the diagram of an electric cell. My
heart was carried away with it at first
sight.
"This is a wonderful book, Sirl" I
exclaimed. "How long do you think
we might keep it?"
"Well," he replied, "I was told that
my lord will stay in Osaka for two
days. I suppose he would not mind
our keeping it until his departure."
"I should like to have my friends
share in seeing the book," I explained,
and bore the volume back to the dor¬
mitory.
"Look at thisl"
All the young men rose up as one
and crowded around me and the book
as eager as I was. Two or three of
the older students and myself decided,
on talking it over, to make a copy
of it.
"See here," we said. "Just looking
at the book won't do you any good.
We must get together and copy it."
But then, to copy a volume of a
thousand pages! We decided to do
just the final chapter, the one on elec¬
tricity. If we could have broken the
book up and divided the copying
among the thirty or fifty "ready-quill
men," the entire contents might have
been kept. But of course injuring the
nobleman's possession was out of the
question.
However, we worked at full speed,
and the Ogata students could work
expertly. One read aloud; another
took down the dictation; when one
grew tired and slowed down, another
was waiting with his quill, and the
exhausted one would go to sleep
regardless of time, morning, noon or
night.
Thus, working day and night, through
meal hours and all, we finished the
whole chapter in the time allotted, and
thus the section on electricity, about
three hundred pages including its
diagrams, remained with us in manu¬
script. We finished reading it against
the text for correction and regretted
that we had no more time for the
other parts.
But to have retained so much we
counted fortunate, and when the even¬
ing of Lord Kuroda's departure came,
we all handled the book affectionately
in turn and gave it a sad leave-taking
as if we were parting with a parent.
When we heard from Ogata Sensei
that Lord Kuroda had paid eighty ryo
for the book, we were dumbfounded.
Such a cost was so far beyond our
conception that we should never have
had even the desire or ambition to
acquire such a treasure.
This event quite changed the whole
approach to the subject of electricity
in the Ogata household. I do not hesi¬
tate to say that my fellow students
became the best informed men on the
new science in the entire country. I
dare say I owe to the copy of this
book much of the knowledge which

of the electrical industry today.
Many years later I remembered the
book and wished to see the original
again. A number of times I called at
the Kuroda residence for the times
had changed and I had become a per¬
sonal friend of the lord but I was
always told that since the great uphea¬
val of the Restoration (1868), the book
had been lost. I have always regretted
this, feeling its loss like separation
from an old friend.
I think this incident will prove that
the young men around Ogata Sensei
were, as a group, as zealous for
foreign culture as any students in the
world. Every now and then a student
came from Yedo to Ogata's school
to study, but never did anyone leave
it for that purpose. If any went to
Yedo, it was for teaching and not for
more study.
We often talked about this fact
among ourselves, and said proudly
that we, the Osaka students, were
above any In the country. But it could
not have been that all the good stu¬
dents gathered in Osaka and no able
ones lived in Yedo. It seems to me
that the situation of the country then
created this contrasting standard of
scholarship in the two cities.
In Yedo, though the country's inter¬
course with foreign lands was yet at
its beginning, there were constant de¬
mands for the Western knowledge
from the government offices and from
the various feudal nobility resident
there. Consequently anyone able to
read foreign books, or make any
translation, secured the reward of this
patronage. There was even the possi¬
bility of a poor language student being
made a high salaried Samurai of
several hundred koku overnight.
Osaka, on the contrary, was a city
of merchants devoted to internal com¬
merce; it was hardly to be expected
that anyone there wanted to be in¬
formed on Dutch gunnery or Western
arts. Therefore, however much we
studied, our work and knowledge had
The Meiji era was preceded by 700 years of feudalism, begun in 1192 when
Yoritomo became Japan's first governor, establishing the Shogunate which ruled
independent of the Emperor until 1868. Throughout the centuries of Shogunate
domination, innumerable statues of the first Shogun were carved. Wood
sculpture of Yoritomo (above) dates from later Edo period (1603-1868).
Under the Shoguns Zen Buddhism flourished, and its impact on the cultural life
of Japan led to the creation of some of the finest Japanese literature and art.
practically no connexion with the ac¬
tual means of gaining a livelihood or
making a name for ourselves.
Not only that, but the students of
Dutch were looked upon with contempt
by most men. Then why did we work
so hard to learn Dutch? It would seem
that we were simply labouring at diffi¬
cult foreign texts for no clear purpose.
However, if anyone had looked into
our inner hearts, he would have found
there an untold pleasure which was
our consolation. In short, we students
were conscious of the fact that we
were the sole possessors of the key
to knowledge of the great European
civilization. However much we suffer¬
ed from poverty, whatever poor clothes
we wore, the extent of our knowledge
and the resources of our minds were
beyond the reach of any prince or
nobleman of the whole nation.
If our work was hard, we were proud
of it, knowing that no one knew what
we endured. "In hardship we found
pleasure, and the hardship was plea¬
sure." To illustrate, our position was
like that of someone taking bitter medi¬
cine without knowing exactly what it
was good for. We simply took it
because nobody else could take it the
more bitter it was, the more gladly
we took it.

THE GREAT MANIFESTO
OF FUKUZAWA
Encouragement
of Learning
Jifp
|l £X
In 1872, Yukichi Fukuzawa published his "Encouragement of Learning." The
essay first appeared as a pamphlet, and the public took to it "like the thirsty to
water." Some 200,000 copies were sold an extraordinary figure for the time.
Fukuzawa went on to publish a series of seventeen essays, all called
"Encouragement of Learning," between 1872 and 1876. They established him
as a thinker and an intellectual leader of the New Japan. The basic ideas in
his first essay, published below, are as fresh and virile to the men of today as
they'were to those of 1872. As Eiichi Kiyooka has written: "There were many
other scholars who advocated new thoughts, but Fukuzawa was foremost
in force and clarity of expression, and above all in reaching a wide circle of
people. It is certain that there has never been in all the history of Japan an essay
that compares with this one in its influence on the Japanese people."

"H EAVEN never created a
man above another nor a man below
another," It is said (1). Therefore, when
men are born, Heaven's idea is that
all men should be equal to all other
men without distinction of high and low
or noble and mean, but that they
should all work with body and mind,
with dignity worthy of the lords of
creation, which they are, in order to
take all things in the world for the
fulfillment of their needs in clothing,
food, and dwelling, freely but without
obstructing others, so that each can
live happily through life.
However, taking a wide view of this
human world, we find wise men and
ignorant men, rich men and poor men,
men of importance and men of little
consequence, their differences like
those of the cloud and the slime. Why
should all this be? The reason is
apparent. In the Jitsugokyo it is said,
"If a man does not study, he will have
no knowledge. A man without know¬
ledge is a fool." The distinction be¬
tween the wise and the foolish comes
from whether they have studied or not.
In society there are difficult tasks
and easy tasks. Those who undertake
difficult tasks are called men of high
standing and those who undertake
easy tasks are called men of low
standing. All the tasks In which one
must use his mind and which involve
much worry are difficult, and those in
which one labours with hands and legs
are easy. And so, physicians, schol¬
ars, government officials, or big mer¬
chants and big farmers who employ
many serving men are to be called
men of high standing and importance.
When a man is high in standing and
importance, his house will naturally be
wealthy and, from the viewpoint of
lowly people, he will appear to be high
beyond their reach. But looking into
the root of it all, we will find that the
difference comes merely from whether
the man has learning or not, and that
there are no Heaven-made distinctions.
The proverb says, "Heaven does
not give riches to men, but gives it to
the labour of men." Therefore, as I
have said before, a man is not born
with rank or riches. Only those who
strive for learning and are capable of
reasoning will become men of rank
and riches while those without learn¬
ing will become poor and lowly.
Learning does not mean knowing
strange words or reading old, difficult
literature or enjoying poems and writ¬
ing verses and such accomplishments,
which are of no real use in the world.
These accomplishments give much
pleasure to the human mind and they
have their own values, but they are
not to be valued and worshipped as
much as the usual run of scholars has
tried to make out.
Since time immemorial, there have
been very few scholars in Chinese
classics who were good household
providers or merchants who were
accomplished in poetry and yet clever
in business. For this reason mer-

general use.

chants and farmers become concern¬
ed when their sons take to learning
seriously, thinking that their fortunes
will eventually be ruined. This is
natural in anxious parents, and proves
that this kind of learning is far remov¬
ed from and quite useless to daily life.
Therefore, this kind of learning
without real use should be left to other
days and one's best efforts should be
given to real learning that is near to
men's everyday use for instance, the
forty-seven letters of the alphabet, the
composition of letters, bookkeeping,
the abacus, and the use of scales.
A

DVANCING farther, there
will be many subjects to be taken up:
Geography is a sort of story of and
guide to Japan and all the countries of
the world; Natural Philosophy is the
study of the nature and the function of
all things under the heavens; History is
a detailed chronology and studies the
conditions of every country in the
world, past and present; Economics
explains the management of a house¬
hold and of a country and of the
world; Ethics gives the natural princi¬
ples for a man's conduct of himself
and with his fellow men and shows
how he should behave in society.
For the study of these subjects, one
should read the translations of West¬
ern books. In writing one may let the
Japanese alphabet suffice in most
cases. If there should be a youth with
a promise in scholarship, let him learn
the "letters written sideways" and let
him grasp the fundamentals in even
one field or one subject, and accord¬
ing to these let him investigate the
principles of things near him, and thus
let him fulfil the need of every day.
Such is Jitsugaku (Scientific Know¬
ledge or Real Learning) for all men,
which should be generally imbibed
without distinction of high or low in
society. Only after this, should men
pursue the separate ways of Samurai,
farmer, artisan, and merchant, and the
household business of each. In this
way a man may attain his independ¬
ence, a house its independence, and
the nation too will attain independence.
In the pursuit of learning, the impor¬
tant thing is to know one's proper
limitations. The nature of a man as
he is born is not bound or restricted;
a man as an adult man and a woman
as an adult woman should be free
and unrestrained in their actions.
However, by stressing freedom alone
without regard to one's proper limit¬
ations, one is most liable to fall
into waywardness and licentiousness.
What is. meant by limitations is to
conform to the reason of Heaven and
humanity and to attain one's own
freedom without infringing upon that
of other men.
The boundary line between freedom
and waywardness lies in whether one
infringes on others or not. For ins¬
tance, when one is using one's own
money, it may seem that one is free
to indulge in wine and women and to
abandon oneself to licentiousness.
But it is not so by any means. One
man's licentiousness will become the
temptation of many men, causing the
general degeneration of the society
and the disruption of education. Even
if the money he spends is his, his sin
cannot be pardoned.
The problems of freedom and inde¬
pendence exist with a nation as much
as they do with an individual man.
Since ancient times, Japan has been
an island country far to the east of
the Asian continent, not associating
with foreign countries, living on its
own produce, and never being sensi¬
ble of want.
But since the Americans came in
the Kaei Era, foreign trade and inter¬
course began and developed to the
state we see today. There have been
arguments of many kinds even after
the opening of the ports, some advo¬
cating loudly the closing of the ports
and the expulsion of foreigners.
However, these arguments take a very
narrow point of view like that of the
proverbial frog at the bottom of a
well; they are not worthy of our note.
T
AKE Japan, take any nation
of the West; every nation is under the
same heavens, illumined by the same
Sun, enjoying the beauty of the same
Moon, sharing the same ocean, breath¬
ing the same air, possessing the same
human sentiments. Therefore, what¬
ever we have in excess we should give
to them, taking to us whatever they
have in excess, teaching each other
and learning together, never ashamed
nor boastful, each fulfilling the needs
of the other, mutually praying for the
happiness of all.
So, according to the reason of
Heaven and the ways of man, a nation
should hold mutual intercourse with
all others, and when reason is against
it, it should bow even before the black
natives of Africa, and when reason
is on its side, it should stand In
defiance of the mighty warships of
England and America, or when the
honour of the country is at stake,

No longer will

but only by
his ability
every man in the whole nation should
throw down his life to defend the
glory of the country. Such should be
the picture of a free and independent
country.
Since the return of the Imperial rule,
Japan's system of government has
come to be much changed. Externally
she associates with the world under
international law; internally she guides
the people to an understanding of
freedom and independence, permitting
the plain people to take family names
and to go on horseback, which one
may consider the finest act of all
times. One may say that the move¬
ment to make the four classes Samu¬
rai, farmer, artisan, and merchant
equal has here been placed on a firm
footing.
I
HEREFORE, henceforth
among the people of Japan there will
be no such thing as the rank to which
a man is born. Only by his ability and
the position he holds will a man's rank
be determined. For instance, it is
proper to pay respect to a government
official, but this is not the respect of
the man himself. We should pay
respect to the fact he holds his posi¬
tion because of his ability and admin¬
isters the precious laws for the
benefit of the people. It is not the
person that one is to respect; it is
the law that one is to respect.
All people remember that during the
Shogun's regime the August Jar of
Tea used to be carried along the
Tokaido Highway. Not only the Jar
of Tea but a hawk in the Shogun's
household was more precious than an
ordinary man; when a horse of the
Shogun's household came by, all the
travellers on the highway stood aside.
Everything, even a piece of stone or
tile, appeared awesome and precious
when the words "belonging to the
Shogun" were attached to it.
Though disliking it for many centur¬
ies, people had become used to it,
and thus the ugly custom came to be.
After all, this did not come from the
dignity of the law, nor from the value
of the things themselves; it was
simply a cowardly device of the
government to show off its power and
to restrict the freedom of the people.
One may call it an empty pretence
without substance.
Nowadays, as such miserable laws
and customs are to be discontinued
throughout the country, people ought
to set their hearts at ease, and if there
should be the least complaint against
the government, they should never
hold it against the officials in secret,
but they should seek a proper channel
to present the case and to argue about
it quietly and without hesitation. If
the case should be in accord with
Heaven's reason and with humanity,
one should fight for it even at the risk
of one's own life. Such shall be the
lot of a man who calls himself a citizen
of a civilized nation.
As I have said before, an individual
man and an individual nation are free
and unrestricted according to Heaven-
made law. And so, if this freedom of
the nation is in jeopardy, one should
not fear to stand against all the nations
of the world, if one's individual freedom
is in jeopardy, one should not stand in
awe of even the government officials.
Moreover, at the time when the
equality of the four classes has been
established, all men should feel secure
in giving free rein to their activities
as long as they follow the ways of
Heaven. However, as every man has
his position in society, he must have
ability and virtue appropriate to his
position. In order to give ability and
virtue to oneself, one must learn the
logic of things. In order to learn the
logic of things, one must study his
letters. This is the reason for the
urgent need of learning.
A;IS we look around today,
the position of the three classes-^-far¬
mer, artisan, and merchant has ad¬
vanced a hundred fold, and soon will be
on a level with the Samurai. Even now
the way has been opened for drawing
talented men from among the three
classes into government service.
Therefore, all men must reflect upon
themselves and realize that they now
occupy a high position, and therefore
must behave in a manner worthy of
that position.
There is no one more pitiful and
obnoxious than the ignorant and the
illiterate. In the extreme of ignorance,
they lose the sense of shame. When
they grow poor and hungry because
of their ignorance, they do not blame
themselves, but they envy the rich,
sometimes banding themselves to
force a petition or even taking to
armed rioting.
Shall I call them shameless, or shall
I call them lawless? They owe their
security to the law of the nation and
they carry on their household business
under the law. They take advantage

of it when they may: Yet, when their
personal greed dictates, they break
the law. Is this not an outrage on
fair reason?
It sometimes happens that a well-
established man with some means
knows only how to accumulate money
but is entirely ignorant in educating
his children. Uneducated children will
be foolish, which is not to be wonder¬
ed at, and they will become lazy and
licentious, finally squandering away
like a wisp of smoke the fortunes
inherited from their ancestors.
To rule such foolish men, reason
will not do; the only way will be to
keep them in order by the show of
force. A proverb of the West says,
"Over foolish people, there is a harsh
government." It is not that the govern¬
ment is harsh of itself; it is the foolish
people who bring harshness upon
themselves.
If the government over foolish
people is harsh, reason requires that
the government over wise people
should be good. Therefore, in our
country, too, we have this kind of
government because there is this kind
of people.
Should our people ever sink into
deeper ignorance and illiteracy, the
government will become even severer
than today. Should people turn their
minds to learning, acquire an under¬
standing of logic, and advance toward
civilization, the government will move
toward freedom and leniency.
The severity or leniency of the
government are natural consequences
of the worth or unworthiness of the
people themselves. Who in the world
would prefer harsh rule to good rule?
Who would not pray for strength and
fortune for his own country? Who
would welcome humiliation from for¬
eigners? These are human sentiments
common to all.
The important thing for everyone
for the present is that he should
regulate his conduct according to
humanity, and apply himself earnestly
to learning in order to absorb a wide
knowledge and to develop abilities
worthy of his position. This will make
it easy for the government to rule
and pleasant for the people to accept
its rule, every man finding his place
and all playing a part in preserving
the peace of the nation.

### 59105: The 'Secret' of Japan's educational triumph

by
Masunori Hiratsuka
THE SECRET
OF JAPAN'S
EDUCATIONAL
TRIUMPH
"IulAPAN is a country of
Islands in the Orient far away from
here. . . As an Oriental country, Japan
has her own fine cultural traditions;
at the same time she has achieved
a remarkable advancement in mod¬
ern technology and such rapid
economic progress that it has even
been called "a miracle." I believe it
is very significant for us to study the
education of such a country."
These observations were made by
Professor Joseph A. Lauwreys, one
of the world's outstanding scholars
on comparative education, in introduc¬
ing a lecture on the development of
modern Japanese education which
I gave at the Institute of Education
of the University of London several
years ago.
Japan ¡s a small country, smaller
than California only one of the fifty
states in the U.S.A. Yet its population
is just over 100 million and it is now
one of the world's giant industrial
nations.
The development of modern edu¬
cation in Japan has been so remarkable
that its enrolment ratio in higher edu¬
cation is today one of the highest in
the world. The enrolment ratio in the
second stage of secondary education
(senior high schools) is now the
world's second highest, and that of
elementary education has been main¬
tained at more than 99 per cent for
boys and girls alike since 1920.
People from every continent have fre¬
quently asked me the same question :
"How has Japan managed to achieve
such rapid progress In schooling within
MASUNORI HIRATSUKA is director of
Japan's National Institute for Educational
Research and chairman of the National Fede¬
ration of Institutes for Educational Research.
A leading authority on educational prob¬
lems in Japan, he became Dean of the
Faculty of Education at Kyushu University
in 1953. Dr. Hiratsuka was director of
Unesco's Department of Education in I960,
and is now a member of the Japanese Na¬
tional Commission for Unesco.
a single century?" Some have even
asked me to divulge the "secret" of
this success.
What interests me particularly about
the question in that those who pose it
appear to imagine that Japan's educa¬
tional resources were almost negligible
before 1872 when its modern school
system was established.
So I always make a point of explain¬
ing that Japan is a country whose
people have maintained a high respect
for education and culture throughout
their long history, and that facilities for
education in various forms did in fact
exist before the Meiji Restoration in
1868. And I never fail to stress the
fact that a solid foundation had been
laid for the rapid advancement of
modern Japanese education.
In 1966 Unesco commemorated the
anniversary of the great Japanese
woman novelist, Shikibu Murasaki, who
wrote her famous "Tale of Genji" in the
Heian Period, 950 years ago. The trans¬
lation of this work into English in the
1930s, revealed to Western readers the
narrative skill of Shikibu Murasaki, in
her account of the adventures of the
hero, Prince Genji, and also her per¬
ceptive descriptions of the court life
of her day.
Shikibu Murasaki is only one of a
number of highly gifted Japanese wo¬
men writers, essayists and poets of the
Heian Period, which witnessed a rich
flowering of art and literature in Japan
and many kinds of cultural and educ¬
ational activities in which Buddhist
priests notably played a leading role.
St.Francis Xavier, a Jesuit priest who
came to Japan in the 16th century,
recorded in one of his letters that the
country had two universities and that
the Japanese people were very In¬
dustrious and polite. Besides the two
universities there were many Buddhist
temple schools whose functions were
similar to those of the cathedral and
monastery schools in medieval Europe.
When we talk about modern educ
ation in Japan, we should not overlook
certain important historical develop¬
ments of the Edo period (1603-1868)
which immediately preceeded the Meiji
Restoration :
Under leyasu Tokugawa, founder
of the Tokugawa Shogunate which
governed Japan during the 265 years
of the Edo period, respect for learning
was made the highest principle of
government, and military training was
relegated to second place ;
With the exception of some minor
troubles, Japan enjoyed over 200 years
of peace a fact unprecedented in
world history ;
Through the integration of Chinese
and Japanese classics with Buddhism,
a religion which had done much to
enrich the country's arts and learning,
a unique Japanese culture was formed ;
Though society was divided into
four categories warriors, farmers, ar¬
tisans and merchants people in all
parts of the country spoke a single
language ;
Japan had two major religions
Buddhism and Shintoism whose
followers were drawn from every class
of society.
Of paramount importance was the
fact that various types of educational
facilities existed and were open to
people from every section of the
community. Towards the end of the
Edo period, Japan had more than
50,000 "Terakoyas", a form of one-
teacher one-classroom school, through¬
out the country. These schools, where
reading, writing and arithmetic were
taught to commoners, were run without
financial support from the government.
For the warrior class there were about
300 schools which were equivalent to
the levels of present-day senior high
schools and junior colleges.
Other types of popular education 1 Q

activities ard apprenticeship in tech-

nical and professional skills ; opportu¬
nities for education were also available
in winter youth camps in agricultural
communities and in Buddhist and
Shinto pilgrimage groups. Through all
these facilities designed to meet the
practical needs of daily life, many
people received some measure of
education.
All children of the warrior class, most
townspeople and a large proportion of
the more prosperous farmers were
literate. Thus, in 1872 when the modern
school system was established in Japan
and the State made itself largely re¬
sponsible for education, a solid found
ation for the development of public
education on modern lines had already
been prepared.

of the Meiji Restoration were resolved
to give top priority to education in their
plans for developing and modernizing
their country. They were dissatisfied
with Japan's existing educational sys¬
tem and looked abroad, seeking to
learn from the experience of other
countries. The great spirit of the Five-
Point Imperial Covenant "to seek
knowledge far and wide" was given
full effect in the field of education.
Japan learned a great deal from the
educational systems of the Nether¬
lands, England, France, U.S.A. and
Germany.
In August 1872 the new public educ¬
ation system, of which Japan can be
rightly proud, was established. It laid
special emphasis on democratic prim¬
ary education. Regardless of sex,
social status or means, all students
were enrolled in the same type of
primary school.
The emphasis on equality in educ¬
ation had already been demonstrated
in 1871 when the Japanese Govern¬
ment, with the future development of
national education in mind, sent

universities in Japan has» almost doubled in the past

five girls to study in the U.S.A. The
youngest, surprisingly, was a little girl
aged seven. Thus the government
affirmed its belief in the important role
that women would play in the modern¬
ization of Japan. Needless to say
many young men also went abroad to
study. Without exception they returned
to make important contributions toward
the making of the new modern Japan.
The first government programme for
the development of education was an
ambitious one. The initial plan,
announced by the Ministry of Education
in September 1872, envisaged the
division of the country into eight uni
versity districts, in each of which there
were to be one university and 32 se¬
condary schools. Each secondary
school district, in turn, was to include
210 primary schools.
In other words, it was proposed
to establish eight universities, 256 se¬
condary schools and 53,760 primary
schools in Japan. The strong em¬
phasis placed by the Meiji govern¬
ment on a democratic education with
equal opportunity for all provided the
basic foundation on which the modern
nation of Japan has been built.
By 1880 there were 28,000 primary
schools with over two million pupils
(just over 40 per cent of school
age children). The enrolment ratio
which was only 25 per cent in 1872
rose to 95 per cent by 1905, and in
1907, the period of compulsory educ¬
ation was extended to six years. Today
the duration of compulsory education
is a full nine years, and enrolment
throughout this period is 99.9 per cent.
Japan's secondary school system has
undergone some important changes
in the course of its development.
After 1886, the main function of sec¬
ondary education, in line with the
European pattern, became more or less
a preparatory stage for college en-

JAPAN'S EDUCATIONAL TRIUMPH (Continued)
'Operation 6-3-3' renovating a nation's school system
trance rather than an extension of
primary education. At the same time,
many types of secondary schools for
technical and vocational training were
opened in order to meet the various
needs of a developing society.
In 1941, only about 20 per cent of
primary school graduates entered
regular four or five year secondary
schools. But this did not mean that
for the remaining 80 per cent schooling
ended with primary education. Statis¬
tics show that some 60 per cent en¬
tered higher primary schools and about
10 per cent were enrolled in part-time
courses for young people. Thus only
about 10 per cent did not receive any
further schooling.
Various opportunities for technical
and vocational training were offered to
graduates of higher primary and pri¬
mary schools through apprenticeship
and on-the-job training in private enter¬
prises. Many young people attended
the so-called miscellaneous schools
which gave short courses in such
fields as dressmaking, cooking, type¬
writing, hairdressing and car driving.
Before the Second World War, a
great variety of institutions of higher
education were open to pupils after
they had completed six years in prim¬
ary school and five years' secondary
education. As of 1945, universities
numbered 48; higher schools, 33;
various kinds of professional schools,
309; teacher training schools of various
types, 106; and higher normal schools,
seven. But the number of students in
these institutions amounted to only
four per cent of the 17 to 21 age group.
Japanese education since the Meiji
era has played a very important role in
promoting social mobility. Many of
Japan's outstanding leaders, including
scholars and statesmen, came from
remote villages. They attained their
present positions not only by their
own efforts, but because educational
opportunities were offered them.
The country people of Japan have a
well known saying that children should
be given a good education even if
farmland has to be sold to pay for it.
Japanese people have continued to
maintain their traditional respect for
learning since the Edo period. Various
types of scholarship programmes have
been established which have aided
a great number of young people from
the poorer sections of the community.
In 1947, in the midst of social chaos
and economic strains due to the war,
the 6-3-3 educational system (six years
of primary school, three years of lower
secondary school and three years of
upper secondary school) was adopted,
and compulsory education was extend¬
ed to nine years.
This was regarded by some as a
rash enterprise, but the decision was
taken because the Japanese people
were convinced that their country
could be reconstructed only through
the promotion of a truly democratic
system of education. And indeed, the
development of the new educational
system was achieved through the
efforts of countless people.
In this connexion, I recall a visit I
made to the U.S.A. in 1950, at the
invitation of the State Department, to
study the U.S. system of higher educ¬
ation. While I was in Abilene, Texas,
I happened to mention that Japan had
adopted the 6-3-3 system simultan¬
eously throughout the country. One
professor told me that he did not see
how that was possible. I was happy
to be able to tell him that by the
sincere and enthusiastic efforts they
had made for their country's recon¬
struction, the Japanese people had
turned the impossibility into reality.
A
LTHOUGH the 6-3-3 sys¬
tem was set up in Japan under the
guidance and inducement of the occu¬
pation authorities, its introduction was
not due to their compulsion alone.
Already in the mid-1 930s there were
scholars among the Japanese Prime
Minister's advisers who regarded the
6-3-3 system in the United States as
the most advanced democratic system
of education in the world, and they
recommended that it be introduced
into Japan.
At the beginning of the 6-3-3 system,
about one half of lower secondary
school graduates entered upper sec¬
ondary schools while most of the
other half left school and took jobs.
Today about 75 per cent enter upper
secondary schools.
The rapid increase in this ratio in
recent years has given rise to many
serious problems. Due to the severity
of the examinations for entry to upper
secondary schools, the lower second¬
ary school has become a preparatory
stage for such examinations rather
than an intermediate stage between
primary education and secondary educ¬
ation proper in which special emphasis
is given to observation and guidance of
the individuality, aptitude and ability of
each pupil.
There has been a tendency in Japan
to regard upper secondary schools of
the general academic type as being
superior to most of the other types,
such as those which provide technical
and vocational education. Regrettably,
those who are labelled good teachers
in Japan are in most cases so judged
by the number of their students who
enter the best-known higher schools.
Japan's Central Advisory Council on
Education has now submitted a report
on the reform of upper secondary
education. After an examination of the
whole situation, it proposes, among
other changes, to diversify the contents
of upper secondary school education;
to provide compulsory education, in
one form or another, up to the age of
18 for those who do not enter the
regular upper secondary schools ; and
to considerably improve and expand
facilities for part-time education, cor¬
respondence courses, miscellaneous
school education and social education.
The Council particularly insisted on
the need for an all-out effort to provide
pupils with educational opportunities
that correspond to their individuality,
aptitude and ability. The Ministry of
Education and local governments are
now striving to implement the Coun¬
cil's proposals.
Under the postwar reform of the
educational system In Japan, various
types of institutions for higher educ¬
ation were reorganized simultaneously,
in 1948, into four-year colleges whose
courses strongly emphasized general
education. Later, a Master's course of
two years and a Doctorate course of
a further three years were offered at
the new colleges which had formerly
been universities. More recently, grad¬
uate school education has also been
rapidly expanding.
The number of students receiving
higher education has been increasing
far more rapidly than was foreseen,
particularly since 1955. The enrol¬
ment ratio is now about 18 per cent.
One of the main reasons is the rise
in the standard of living; another is
Japan's rapid economic growth. A
further and even more important
reason is that those who believe
in the democratic right of equal oppor¬
tunity in education have increasingly
sent their children to colleges and uni¬
versities.
As of 1967 there were 369 univer¬
sities and university institutes, 451
junior colleges, and 54 technical
colleges in Japan. Within ten years,
the enrolment ratios are expected to
reach 85 per cent for upper secondary
schools and 25 to 30 per cent for
higher education.
The number of women students at
higher educational institutions has
been Increasing year by year, which is
very gratifying in a democratic society.
Prior to the war women were not
admitted to the Tokyo Imperial Univer¬
sity, except in rare cases. Christian
mission schools played a very impor¬
tant role in the education of Japanese
women, and most of the outstanding
women leaders were educated in pri¬
vate colleges. Today most junior
colleges are for women.
Instruction in special fields is provid¬
ed by various educational institutions ma
such as the miscellaneous schools / j
where cooking, dressmaking, flower
arrangements, etc. are taught. On-the-
job training in private firms and factor-

JAPAN'S EDUCATIONAL TRIUMPH
(Continued)
ies and correspondence courses have
been becoming increasingly popular.
Recently, education for mothers ^ has
been promoted through special "mo¬
thers'" schools throughout the country,
but Japan is still far behind other
advanced countries in this respect.
Needless to say, teacher training is
the most fundamental factor for the
development of education, and has
been given special priority by the
government. In 1943, teacher training
schools were reorganized into colleges
at the higher education level. In 1948
it was decided that school teachers,
including those in primary schools,
must qualify at a four-year university
course, and at the same time, the
status of teacher training colleges was
raised to university level.
With the rapid advance of science
and technology, mass communication
media such as radio and television
have themselves become a major area
of education. The school broadcasts
of NHK (Japanese Broadcasting Cor¬
poration) have been very useful not
only in enhancing the educational
effect of classroom teaching, but
also for correspondence course pro¬
grammes in secondary education.
They are now proving to be an indis¬
pensable means of education for chil¬
dren and students at schools in remote
areas where educational facilities and
materials are still insufficient. Thus,
they are playing a big role in elimin¬
ating regional differences in educ¬
ational levels and in improving general
educational standards.
Radio, TV, films and other kinds of
audio-visual aids to teaching have been
increasingly utilized in Japanese
schools, improving the quality of educ¬
ation at all levels.
In conclusion, I would like to point
out some of the fundamental problems
facing Japanese education today.
Firstly, education is generally consid¬
ered as a form of school education.
Not enough attention is paid to
education at home, which is extremely
important, nor to the significant
influence of pre-school environments
upon children. No less important is
the significance of social education or
adult education after the end of school
education. What is really important
is the idea of life-long education.
Secondly, a limited view is taken of
human ability. Ability is generally
understood as intellectual, while the
existence of other kinds of abilities
technical, artistic, social (for better
human relations) and physical abilities
are easily forgotten.
Thirdly, the evaluation of vocations
is based on this erroneous view of
human abilities. It is unfortunate that
the meanings and social roles of dif¬
ferent vocations are not fully appre¬
ciated.
Educational leaders in Japan are now
trying to develop an education that is
truly worthy of the name, taking into
consideration the individuality, aptitude
and ability of each student.

J APAN is the world's lead¬
ing shipbuilder, second greatest pro¬
ducer of motor vehicles and elec¬
tronics, and third largest producer of
steel. It is the leading exporter of
textiles and textiles machines: 20 per
cent of the world's staple fibres are
made there. And it is a major fishing
nation with an annual catch of 12 mil¬
lion tons.
Yet only 15 per cent of Japan is
arable, and below the surface of the
land, there are few mineral resources,
the basis on which most industrialized
countries are built.
The phenomenon of modern Japan
is due to many reasons, not the least
of which are the industry and intelli¬
gence of its people. But equally im¬
portant is their unique ability to rise
to the challenge of foreign culture,
while maintaining their own identity.
When the Meiji Reformation initiated
its open-door policy to the West, the
tools of Occidental civilization the
Japanese seized most eagerly were
science and technology. Using them
with skill and imagination, they built

Plant in Iran, and in the U.S.A.

dustrial nation, in just 30 years.
Despite the curtain of isolation arbit¬
rarily run down around the island
empire by its feudal government, West¬
ern science found its way into Japan in
1823, when Philip Franz von Siebold, a
German medical officer in the service
of the Dutch (the only Westerners
allowed to maintain contact during
Japan's national seclusion) opened a
school in Nagasaki to teach medicine
and botany.
He was expelled from Japan in 1829
when he was found in possession of
a map of the country, at that time a
serious offence for foreigners. How¬
ever, the seed of modern learning was
planted, and one of his students. Tak-
ano Chöei, became a distinguished
scholar of Western sciences, spreading
the new knowledge mainly through
his translations into Japanese of Eur¬
opean scientific works.
Near the end of the feudal govern¬
ment's rule, a research institute for
"foreign" sciences was established in
1853 where astronomy, geology, phy-

sics, mathematics and chemistry, as
well as Western languages, were
taught. Science instruction was also
started at two military schools. In¬
dustry, in the form of blast and rever-
batory furnaces, and iron and cotton
mills, was also begun.
When the Imaginative Meiji leaders
came to power In 1867, their approach
to science ana technology stemmed
from their policy of strengthening the
nation by "seeking knowledge far
and wide." They brought modern
science to Japan by importing not only
books but brains: almost 600 Western
engineers, lured by salaries as high
as $2,000 dollars a month, as well as
the challenge of modernizing a med¬
ieval country, came from the West
to direct new technological projects.
Although six government ministries
were involved in promoting science
and technology, the leading body in
the early years of the Reformation
was the Ministry of Technology which
established the railway and telegraph
services, managed government plants
and mines, built lighthouses, and
promoted the education of Japanese
engineers, mainly through its adminis¬
tration of the school of technology,
founded in 1871 and later amalgamated
with Tokyo Imperial University.
The Imperial University was Jap¬
an's first university in the true sense
that research as well as education was
carried out. Founded in 1877, it be¬
came the leading centre for training
modern scientists and engineers.
Foreign instructors were predominant
in the beginning, with 12 of the 15 pro¬
fessors of science coming from abroad.
Various countries influenced various
disciplines: mathematics, physics and
chemistry developed chiefly under the
Influence of the United States and
Great Britain, medicine under Ger¬
many, and agriculture, biology, geology
and mineralogy almost equally under
Britain, U.S.A. and Germany.
As science was being brought to
Japan by foreign experts, Japanese
students were being sent abroad to
study. The main aim of the govern¬
ment in sending the students abroad
was to train them as teachers, and in
1884 they started to replace foreign
instructors. By 1893, scientific educa¬
tion had passed completely into the
hands of Japanese professors.
Since the modernization of industry
was forcibly initiated by the Meiji gov¬
ernment, its role was important in
the development of science and tech¬
nology, especially the latter. Through
the national research institutes attach¬
ed to each government ministry, re¬
search and development was encour¬
aged, promoted and systemized,
especially with a view to improving
industrial technology.
Development at this time in the
various branches of science included:
calendar compiling and land surveying
by the Bureau of Geography, estab¬
lished in 1871 ; the founding of the
Tokyo Meteorological Observatory in
1875, which had twenty meteorological
stations in operation by 1900; the for¬
mation of the Japan Seismology Soc¬
iety in 1880, the first such organiz¬
ation in the world; and research work
in physics and biology.

major contributor to Japanese biology.
He arrived from the United States in
1877 to find that "evolution," whose
principles had been ennunciated by
Charles Darwin twenty years before,
was an unknown concept. He introduc¬
ed it in his lectures and public meetings,
and the idea was spread further by
Japanese scientists.
In the early 1890s, about the time
Japanese professors were replacing
Westerners in the academic structure,
Japanese scientists began to come
into their own.
Perhaps the first creative Japanese
chemist was Takamine Jokichi who
discovered and synthetized adrenalin
In 19!/0, and the enzyme, Taka-Dias-
tase, in 1909; in 1910, another chemist,
Suzuki Umetaro, discovered vitamin B;
Nagoka Nantaro took Japan's first step
in the direction of nuclear physics
when he published his "Theory on
Atom Structure" in 1903; Kitazato Shi-
basaburo's Institute for Research of
Infectious Diseases, founded in 1892,
was regarded as one of the world's
three leading research Institutes. The
Japanese, although still striving to
reach the level of Western science,
began to reap the fruits of their intel¬
lectual industry and determination.
At the end of the 19th century, with
the development of the textile, ship¬
building and machine industries, the
manufacture of iron, coal mining, and
the electric power industry, Japan
gradually caught up with Western in¬
dustrial powers.
By 1919, manufacturing had sur¬
passed agriculture as Japan's most
important economic activity, and the
industrial "centre of gravity" shifted
to heavy and chemical industries.
World War One had a profound effect
on Japanese science. Until then, it
had developed in step with the West,
but with international relations disrupt¬
ed, Japan's scientists for the first time
charted an independent course. Re¬
search institutions were founded during
and immediately after the war and
through them science was finally har¬
nessed to technique and industry to
serve as a driving force for progress.
Post-World War One scientific
achievements were numerous: in phy¬
sics, research into metals, especially
new steels aided Japanese industry,
and nuclear physics made rapid pro¬
gress with Yukawa Hideki presenting
his "Theory of Mesotrons" in 1934 (for
which he received Japan's first Nobel
Prize in 1949). The second Nobel
Prize awarded to a Japanese went to
another physicist, Tomanaga Shini-
chlro in 1965.
In geophysics, Japan continued to
pioneer seismological research; in bio¬
logy, Fujii Kenjiro did outstanding re¬
search on chromosomes; in medicine,
advances in the study of cancer were
remarkable, beginning with the arti¬
ficial generation of cancer in 1915 and
later studies of liver cancer; in chem¬
istry and agriculture, diligent in¬
vestigations often had direct bearing
on industry and food production.
However, this new maturity was to
bear too little positive results in the
decades that followed: Japanese
scientific and industrial efforts were
subordinated in the early 1930s to the

Japanese welders and painters form a
striking pattern on the hull of the
big cargo vessel under construction,
far left. This giant ship will soon
be dwarfed by mammoth ocean tankers
of 500,000 tons which Japan, the
world's largest shipbuilder, will be
constructing by 1970. Japan's position
as an industrial colossus has been
attained despite its few mineral
resources. Every inch of the land is
exploited to the full, epitomized in
the extraordinary photo of tiny Hajima

buildings, cliff faces and Erector

military establishment, which led the
country to defeat in World War Two.
For several years after the war,
scientific and technological research
activities in Japan were virtually
suspended. American occupation
forces banned research on atomic
energy, armaments, and aeronautics,
and dismantled Japan's cyclotron.
In 1951, the peace treaty was
signed, and in 1954 research in atomic
physics and the development of
atomic energy were resumed. The
Science and Technology Agency was
established in 1956 to co-ordinate
activities in those fields, and in the
same year Japan's Atomic Energy
Commission was formed.
About 1955, Japan's post-war
prosperity began and, recognizing the
indispensability of science and techno¬
logy to the resurging economy, the
government and private enterprise
built new universities, faculties and
research institutes.
There was a conspicuous reliance
in Japan at that time on foreign tech¬
niques, but efforts were started, and
are being continued, by industry
to redress this situation through
financing scientific and technological
research at universities, and expanding
or establishing their own research
institutions.
Poor conditions for study impose
great restrictions on the development
of basic research. This has resulted
in a great many Japanese scientists
going abroad in search of better re¬
search facilities, a situation that has
hardly improved, especially in math¬
ematics, physics and chemistry.
Although there are many universities
in Japan, most of them were raised
to their present status during post-war
reforms . and they are inferior in
equipment to those founded before
the war. When the education reform
started in 1949, Japan had 172 science
and technological facilities: by 1963
they had increased to 263, 130 nation¬
al, 29 public, and 104 private.
In 1963, there were 107 research
institutes attached to the universities,
used jointly by all three types of
universities for basic research.
Apart from these centres, there are
about 80 national research Institutes,
attached to government ministries,
which do basic research as well as
conduct other investigations in such
fields as public health, disaster
prevention, industrial technology, etc.
Between 1953 and 1965, Japan
increased its expenditure on scientific
and technological research nine times
to $1,180 million. Private sources
provided more money than the gov¬
ernment, whose research spending
on defence is low, compared to other
countries, accounting for only about
one per cent. In fact, industry spent
almost three times the government
amount on research in 1963-64.
However latest figures show that the
Japanese government is increasing its
share: in 1967-68, official spending on
research and development rose by
almost 15 per cent.
The government, for the most part,
finances the national and public uni¬
versities since tuition fees and other
incomes amount to only five per cent
of their expenses. Private universi¬
ties, attended by 70 per cent of
Japan's students in higher education,
depend mainly on tuition fees for
their financing, and in order to secure
the necessary funds, they enrol many
students some maintain, too many.
Their facilities are not as good as
the national universities, so the
government has instituted special sub¬
sidies to assist them with equipment
expenses and student research.
A LTHOUGH science and
technology students have Increased
twice as fast (between 1954-64) as
students in other faculties, their num¬
bers need to be greatly increased,
and an enrolment of a further 170,000
is planned.
Possible reasons for the shortage
of students may be the comparatively
modest salaries and the system of
remuneration of Japanese scientists
and engineers, particularly early on in
their careers. Pay is largely based
on status and seniority, and there is
insufficient recognition of talent.
Recently, a new staff system was
introduced in industry, intended to
encourage higher knowledge and
creativity.
Despite these problems, Japan has
been able to develop into one of the
six most advanced technological
countries of the world. The key
industry in this prodigious rise has
been electronics, where Japan's
output is second only to the U.S.A.'s.
In 1966, Japan produced over three
thousand million dollars worth of elec¬
tronics, 30 per cent of which was ex¬
ported. In telecommunications, the
country's micro-wave networks are
second largest in the world, and handle
all television broadcasts and half the
telephone transmissions. Japan's 100
million people have 13 million tele¬
phones and 20 million TV receivers.
The best known product of Japan's
electronics industry is the transistor
radio, a now commonplace instrument
of communication that has had far-
reaching effects on listening habits
throughout the world.
Among Japanese electronic advan¬
ces have been the Esaki diode, and
the development of a novel computing
device called the "parametron"' which
performs logical and storing functions
in telephone exchanges, telegraph
printers, machine tools, and in digital
computers.
Computers, in fact, are the core of
Japan's electronics industry, in the
absence of any large defence or
space programme, and Japan uses
more computers than any other
nation. Its first automatic computer
was built in 1952, and a current
ambitious programme, to build an ultra¬
high performance computer system,
began with State aid in 1966.
Japan has also been a leading
nation in the development of peaceful
uses of nuclear energy. In 1967, the
Japanese Atomic Energy Commission
began a big new ten-year programme
of research, development and utili¬
zation, with an estimated budget of
over $1,200 million. Nuclear power
Installations are to be increased with
a target capacity of 6,000 megawatts
for 1975, and between 30,000 and
40,000 MW for 1985.
Also in 1967, the keel was laid for
Japan's first nuclear ship, an 8,300 ton
vessel which is to be launched
in 1969.
To keep Japan's economy vigorous,
a "Medium-Term Economic Plan" was
introduced in 1965. Among the
scientific measures which were
recommended in support of it were:
the need to couple the advancement
of science and technology with
Japan's economic growth, improve the
quality of scientists and engineers,
increase research in public welfare,
raise the level of technological work
in agriculture, forestry and fisheries,
and the smaller enterprises, assist and
encourage research by tax relief, and
improve the research environment.
This last mentioned is no mere
platitude. A complete new "Science
City" north of Tokyo, is to be com¬
pleted by the mid-1970s. Its residents
will be 52,000 scientists and engineers
working in 40 laboratories, to improve
the world around us.

### 59109: Japan's contribution to Western literature and the arts

JAPAN'S CONTRIBUTION
TO WESTERN
LITERATURE
AND THE ARTS
by Earl Miner

UST as there ¡s a creative
interplay between tradition and change
within a national literature, so is there
commonly a fruitful encounter between
the artistic genius of one nation and
the differing genius (which is common¬
ly not well understood) of another.
Among the nations, Japan is at once
unusually creative and unusually sus¬
ceptible to foreign modes. It has also
proved highly effective in exporting
features of its culture to other nations.
More than that, we may say precisely
that the dominant spiritual or intellec¬
tual effect of Japan upon other nations
has been artistic.
If too little is known abroad about
Japanese law, philosophy, linguistics,
rhetoric, social theory, and other na¬
tional achievements, the reason is
hardly that Japanese are by nature
without talent for such enterprises than
that other countries have had a greater
need for Japanese understanding of
human experience in artistic forms.
Enthusiasm and doubt over Japan
are not new responses. After arriving
in Japan in 1549, St. Francis Xavier
declared, "these people are the delight
of my heart." In 1577, another Jesuit
wrote that, religion apart, Europeans
were barbarous by comparison with
Japanese. In 1668, it was claimed
that Japan "exceeded in beauty and
magnificence all the pride of the Vati¬
can at this time and the Parthenon here¬
tofore." But the country was often
regarded as a symbol of the far-away,
and the cruel or "impenetrable."
By 1856 the self-isolation of the
EARL MINER, professor in the Depart¬
ment of English at the University of Cali¬
fornia (U.S.A.), has written widely on
Japanese literature and its influence on
Western arts and literature. He is the
author of "Japanese Tradition in British and
American Literature" (Princeton University
Press, New Jersey, 1951). A well-known
translator into English of Japanese litera¬
ture, and notably poetry, he is co-author
with Professor Robert Brower of "Japanese
Court Poetry" (Stanford University Press,
Stanford, U.S.A., 1962). As a Fulbright
professor of English literature, he taught at
the universities of Osaka and Kyoto in 1961.
country had become a source of irri¬
tation to powers like England, France
Russia, and the United States ; and
there was a sense that little more could
be said or done until the nation was
open once more. Yet in that same
year, according to cherished French
legend, Félix Bracquemond discovered
a volume of Hokusai's wood-block
prints which soon became his "bre¬
viary."
Because the terms in which French
writers and artists regarded Japanese
culture were to dominate or charac¬
terize Western cultural interest in Jap¬
an for half a century or more, we may
defer consideration of them for the mo¬
ment while we examine the responses
of those two countries more closely
involved in the opening of Japan.
It might seem strange that the Unit¬
ed States and England benefitted far
less artistically from first-hand contact
with Japan than the French from more
detached interest, but it was France
that was on the verge of a great artis¬
tic revival, and we must understand at
once that a nation, in this case Japan,
is often most influential in these mat¬
ters from a dim distance.
I NSTEAD of seeking aesth¬
etic inspiration, the United States
entered into its passionate and ambi¬
valent attachment with Japan (one need
only compare the American story, Ma¬
dame Butterfly, with the cold exoticism
of Pierre Loti), and England showed a
characteristically restrained enthusiasm
that found its highest expression in the
work of some remarkable scholars
B.H. Chamberlain, James Murdoch (a
Scot), W.G. Aston, and several others.
They and their successors built upon
the worthy foundations of Jesuit wri¬
ters, of seventeenth-century German
historians like the very able Englebert
Kaempfer, and the Dutch historians
who carried all before them in the
eighteenth century. Scholarly inter¬
est in Japan, leading as it often does
to translations of major literary works,
has always been important in control¬
ling more fanciful responses to Japan.
In nearly every Western country today
there are scholars treading on the suc¬
cessive footprints of Spaniards, Ger¬
mans, Dutch, and English.
In nineteenth-century America, Clio,
the severer Muse of history, was less
welcome than her more rapturous and
mythographic sisters. The excitement
began with news of Commodore Mat¬
thew Perry's success, in 1853. When
a Japanese mission, come to ratify
Perry's treaty, visited several Ameri¬
can cities in 1860, excitement was un¬
bounded.
On June 26, "The New York Times"
wrote of the unparalleled magnificence
of the spectacle. The next day it
carried a poem by Walt Whitman, "The
Errand-Bearers." The Japanese were
"lesson-giving princes," and they
brought the Orient "The next of
languages, the bequeather of poems,
the race of old." Much in this derives
from the philo-orientalism of the Amer¬
ican Transcendentalists, but Whitman
had actually seen Japanese visitors,
as it were from Eden.
Such enthusiasm came to be
heightened and hazed over by a
veil of exoticism, and in particular
that associated with Lafcadio Hearn.
Partly because of the titles of his
writings, partly because of the slow
surf that beats in his prose style, many
assumed that he told of life in a
distant paradise. He himself sought
to harmonize Buddhism with the evo¬
lutionary philosophy of Herbert
Spencer, and if he was in Eden, he
grew increasingly dissatisfied with it.
He was, however, sufficiently Ameri¬
can (again the contrast with Pierre
Loti is valid) to be deeply attached to
that which he grew to dislike. What
seemed mere exoticism actually con¬
cealed the cultural relativism and aesth-
etlcism in which was rooted the artistic
plant that nourished Hearn: Impres¬
sionism.
So significant and widespread an
artistic movement as Impressionism
has many causes, manifestations, and
effects. But no one has ever question¬
ed that its characteristic expression
was French, and its characteristic
medium, painting. If a Hearn could
take Impressionist thought and prose
style to Japan, it was in no small mea-

### 59109: Japan's contribution to Western literature and the arts

The Meiji Restoration not only opened the West to the people of Japan;
it also opened Japan to the Western world. The wealth of Japan's cultural
heritage, especially its art and literature, struck the West with full force
and has since had an abiding influence on Western art and thought. The
way in which both the arts of Japan and the arts of the West have mutually
benefitted from this contact is the keynote of a series of manifestations
organized by Unesco to commemorate this year's centenary of the Meiji
Cultural Revolution. Among these are an international round table on
these mutual influences, held in Kyoto and Tokyo, in September, an exhibi¬
tion of works of art by Japanese and Western artists, in Tokyo, as well
as the publication of an art album (now in preparation), all on the same
theme. A special study on the translation of Western literature into Japa¬
nese, and its effect on the development of Japanese writing is also being
undertaken by the Unesco-sponsored Centre for East Asian Cultural Studies
(Tokyo). The present article is condensed from an essay on "The Signifi¬
cance of Japan to Western Literature," by Professor Earl Miner, presented
to the Unesco International Round Table.

10th century Japan. Known as "the market sage", he went among the people to
teach them the wisdom of Nembutsu (Buddha of Infinite Enlightenment), also called OQ

whenever the monk invoked the name of Nembutsu.

### 59109: Japan's contribution to Western literature and the arts

JAPAN'S CONTRIBUTION (Continued)
The triumph
of Japonisme'
Japanese art, especially the Japanese
print, exerted a strong influence
on Western painting during the last
30 years of the 19th centuiy.
The Impressionists agreed with
Vincent Van Gogh when he called
Japanese prints "the true religion".
Van Gogh studied the prints
minutely, analyzing their bold
perspective, their structuring of space
and their use of bright colour.
He tried to imitate the techniques
and even the motifs of masters
like Hiroshige and Eisen, seeking
to capture their conception of
landscape painting with all its poetry,
which dominated many of
Van Gogh's works before his death
(see colour reproductions page 36
and caption page 34). Below,
"Le Père Tanguy", painted by
Van Gogh in 1887 and now in
the Rodin Museum, Paris. The
painting is a frank mixture of
Western art (the model) and that of
Japan (the background). Père
Tanguy, a dealer in artists' materials,
was well known in Paris as a
collector of "Japonaiseries" (prints
and things Japanese). Van Gogh
painted him seated before works by
the two great early 19th century
Japanese artists, Eisen and Kunisada.
sure because Japan was a significant
part of Impressionism.
In the latter half of the last century,
a French vogue for things Chinese
was followed by Japonisme, which was
taken up from about 1865 to 1895 by
the foremost French writers and paint¬
ers. The brothers Goncourt, Clemen¬
ceau, Montesquiou, Huymans, and
Renan shared in the promotion of
Japonisme. The painters Manet,
Monet, Duret, Gauguin, Toulouse-
Lautrec, and such others as Van Gogh,
Whistler, and Mary Cassât set Japo¬
nisme as the highest and most mean¬
ingful contemporary artistic code.
Duret insisted that "the Japanese are
the first and finest Impressionists,"
and Van Gogh, that Japanese art is the
"true religion."
Today we are apt to regard other
elements as more formative in shap¬
ing Impressionism than the exoticism,
naturalism, and aestheticism so pecu¬
liarly mixed in Japonisme. It is there¬
fore all the more remarkable that the
Impressionists and Symbolists them¬
selves attributed so central a role to
Japan and its art. A rhetorical question
by Jules de Goncourt says it all: "The
search after reality in literature, the
resurrection of eighteenth century art,
the triumph of Japonisme are not
these the three great literary and artis¬
tic movements of the second one-half
of the nineteenth century?"
How was it possible to write in such
terms? To this question, as to many
questions, the simplest answer is to
be preferred. French painters discov¬
ered that the sensibility, colour, and
composition revealed in Japanese art
spoke to them as nothing else did. To
writers as well, what was Japanese
seemed beautiful, new, real and a
revealing model for their own work.
The colour blockprint became the
badge of Japonisme; indeed it became
in a double sense the lingua franca of
Impressionism. When so much that
was Japanese still lay closed to
Western eyes behind the wall of lan¬
guage, the colour print (which was then
in fact despised by cultivated Japan¬
ese) required, it seemed, no dictionary
to translate its meaning, no gloss for
its eloquence. To Manet it could teach
colour; to Zola it could show a slice of
Naturalistic life.
Certain features of the Japonisme
adapted by the Impressionists have
continued to dominate artistic respon¬
ses to Japan. The first principle Is that
of the so-to-speak contemporaneity of
Japanese civilization to our own. To be
sure, block print artists like Hokusai
and Hiroshige were only a generation
or so senior to the Impressionist paint¬
ers, but one frequently discovers later
writers treating Matsuo Bashô (1644-
1694), Motokiyo Zeaml (1363-1444), and
even Kakinomoto Hitomaro (680-700)
as their contemporaries.
Whatever such attitudes may do to a
historian's equilibrium, they imply
highly significant beliefs. First, with
the Impressionists Japan became rele
vant for the first time to what was
most creative in contemporary Europ¬
ean civilization. Second, the major
relevance, apart from the general one
of sensibility, was artistic technique.
In the century since the Meiji Rest¬
oration this double view has dominated
most significant artistic approaches
to Japan. And until perhaps World
War II it was also likely to be the case
that enthusiasts for Japan were first
captivated by the Japanese print.
Europe also owes to France the first
popular discovery of Japanese poetry.
There had been in France, as in other
countries, a certain amount of dread¬
ful pseudo-Japanese writing; indeed
there would continue to be some. But
after the publication of Marcel Revon's
Anthologie de la Littérature Japonaise
(1910), simple exoticism was no longer
intellectually respectable.
There was, however, a sudden vogue
for haikai in French (1). Some French
poets composed so-called haikai in
the trenches during World War I, and
thousands of these verses were sent
to competitions held by the "Nouvelle
Revue Française." But the really
creative discovery of Japanese poetry
was peculiarly international prompted
by France, it was an American discov¬
ery in England.
IHE important figure in the
poetic adaptation of Japan is Ezra
Pound, who wrote in the "Egoist" for
June 1, 1914: "I trust that the gentle
reader is accustomed to take pleasure
in *Whistler and the Japanese'. Other¬
wise he had better stop reading my
article until he has treated himself to
some further draughts of education."
Pound clearly regarded his fellow
American expatriate as a catalyst for a
widespread cultural reaction involving
Japan, France, and his own poetic
interest. In fact, Whistler had preach¬
ed Japanese gospel in England since
the late 1860s. The Identification of
him with Japanese art was a com¬
monplace, and his erstwhile friends,
Swinburne and Wilde, sometimes
went so far as to make the connexion
between Whistler's French terminology,
by writing 'nocturnes' or 'études' in
their poetry, and his Japanese interests,
by writing an "Impression Japonaise".
At all events, Pound's phrase,
"Whistler and the Japanese," shows
that the first Impressionist lesson had
been learnt: Japan is creatively relev-
(/) In Japan as In the West the terms
haikai, hokku, and haiku are often used
Interchangeably. Strictly speaking haikai
are integrated sequences, or single verses
that might be integrated a presumption
lasting to the beginning of the Meiji period;
hokku are first verses of such a sequence;
haiku is a term really current only In the
Meiji period and after for a discretely
considered form of 5, 7, 5 syllables. Today
haiku is often used loosely for all three
terms. It is curious that in the early years
of this century usual French usage was
haikai, English was hokku, and American
was haiku.

NINE WRITERS
OF MODERN JAPAN
We present below brief notes on nine authors of modern Japan.
Many have had novels and short stories translated into English.
See "Bookshelf," page 74, for a short bibliography of works from
Japan published in English under Unesco's Literature Translations
Programme.
YASUNARI
KAWABATA
Born in 1899, Yasunari Kawabata
revealed his literary talent in the
essays and stories he contributed
to magazines and newspapers
while he was still in college.
After graduating from Tokyo Im¬
perial University, he launched a
literary magazine and quickly
established his reputation as a
novelist with "The Izu Dancer".
Certain of his later novels, such
as "The Flower Waltz", evoke
the ephemeral beauty of world¬
ly things, and "Snow Coun¬
try", one of his major novels,
recounts a love story in the
setting of a mountain village. A
distinguished literary critic, he
has discovered many promising
young Japanese writers.

YUKIO MISHIMA
Born in 1925, Yukio Mishima had
already published an immense
volume of work by the time he
was 37 years old a dozen novels,
more than 50 volumes of short
stories, six modern plays and a
number of Kabuki and modern-
version Nô plays. Although best
known for his portrayal of post¬
war youth in Japan, he has often
turned to classical Japanese liter¬
ature for his material, an inter¬
est reflected in his dramas.
Among his works published in
English are: "Confessions of a
Mask", "Death in Midsummer",
"Twilight Sunflower", "Five Mod¬
ern Nô Plays" and "The Temple
of the Golden Pavilion".

SHOHEI OOKA
Author of a number of prize-
winning novels, Shohei Ooka
was born in Tokyo in 1909. For
his "Story of a Prisoner of War",
based on his own experiences
in World War II, he was awarded
the Yokomitsu Prize in 1948, and
two years later his novel, "Fire
in the Plains", received the Yo-
miuri Literary Prize. One of
Japan's leading authorities on
French literature, Shohei Ooka
has translated a number of
Stendhal's works into Japanese.

JUNJI KINOSHITA
One of Japan's best known mod¬
ern playwrights, Junji Kinoshita
has developed a style of drama
based on Japan's old folk stories.
For his dramatic work "The Even¬
ing Crane", he was awarded the
Mainichi Drama Prize in 1949,
and another of his plays, "Wind
and Wave", received the first
Kishida Drama Prize. Junji Kino¬
shita, who was born in 1914, is
also well known as a translator
of Western authors, both modern
and classical, from Somerset
Maugham to Shakespeare.

YASUSHI INOUE
Yasushi Inoué, who was born in
1907, began his writing career as
a journalist, after winning a liter¬
ary prize awarded by a Japanese
newspaper group. In 1946 he
published "Bullfight", a novel
later awarded the Akutagawa Pri¬
ze, and in 1947 wrote "The Hunt
ing Gun", another highly praised
novel, which has been translated
several times into English, one
version of which, under the title
"Shotgun", is found in "Modern
Japanese Stories" (see Book¬
shelf, page 74). Yasushi Inoué's
work is characterized by a poetic
quality, and in fact he published
many poems early in his career.
In 1951 he gave up newspaper
work and has since devoted all
his time to writing books, includ¬
ing a number of historical novels.

OGAI MORI
Ogai Mori, who was born in
1862 and died in 1922, played a
major role in the development of
modern literature in Japan. His
linguistic ability combined with
high literary gifts enabled him to
produce outstanding translations
of Goethe, Schiller, Ibsen and
other great European writers,
translations which influenced not
only modern literature and
modern theatre in Japan, but
which also gave an impetus to
modern Japanese poetry. The son
of a doctor, he went to Germany
in 1884 to pursue his own study
of medicine and remained abroad
for four years. He was thus the
first Japanese writer to become
well-acquainted with Europe.
Ogai Mori introduced the West¬
ern type short story to Japan
and wrote plays in the Western
style. The historical stories, nov¬
els and biographies he wrote in
his later years are often con¬
sidered to be his finest works.

JUNICHIRO
TANIZAKI
Junichiro Tanizaki was born in
Tokyo in 1886 and studied Japan¬
ese literature at Tokyo Imperial
University. After publishing a
one-act play and numerous stor¬
ies, Tanizaki became known as
a leader of the so-called neo-
romantic school in Japanese mod¬
ern literature. His most import¬
ant novels were written after
1923, and the first to be published
in English was "Some Prefer
Nettles" (about the conflict bet¬
ween the lure of Western inno¬
vations and nostalgia for tradi¬
tional Japanese ways), followed
by "The Makioka Sisters" (1957),
"The Key" 1961, "Seven Japan
ese Tales" (1963) and "The
Diary of a Mad Old Man" (1965).
For "The Makioka Sisters", he
received the Imperial Prize in
Literature in 1949. Among Tani-
zaki's major literary works is his
masterly translation into modern
Japanese of the great 11th century
classic. "The Tale of Genji".

KOBO ABE
Kobo Abé is representative of a
new group of Japanese novelists
who have turned their attention
to universal themes. Born in
1924, he studied medicine, but
after graduating In 1948 decided
to follow a literary career, and
the same year published his first
book, "The Sign at the End of
the Road". Novelist, poet and
playwright, Kobo Abé has re¬
ceived a number of literary
awards for his books and plays:
the Akutagawa Prize for his nov¬
el "The Crime of Mr. S. Karuma",
and the Yomiuri Prize for "The
Woman In the Dunes". In 1963,
the latter was made into a film
whose international success help¬
ed to make this novel about
modern man and the society in
which he lives even more widely
known.

KAFU NAGAI
Kafu Nagai was born in Tokyo in
1879 and died there in 1959. The
people of Tokyo and the chang¬
ing face and moods of the great
city were his favourite subjects
and he wrote about them with
nostalgia and affection. Early in
the century, after spending sever¬
al years abroad in the U.S.A.
and France, he wrote two vol¬
umes of short stories and sket¬
ches which strongly reveal the
influence of French literature.
Among his novels which have
been translated into English are
"The Fox", "The River Sumida"
and "The Two Wives". "A Strange
Tale from East of the River",
often considered to be the mas¬
terpiece of his later years, was
recently published in English,
together with fragments of his
other works and a long bio¬
graphical essay under the title
"Kafu the Scribbler" (See Book¬
shelf, page 74).

### IGNORE

KABUKI. Dating back to
the end of the 16th
century, this traditional
dramatic art of Japan has
attained a perfection
which draws large
audiences, including many
young people.
With its superb costumes,
decor and lighting, its
elaborate make-up,
dancing, vocal and
musical accompaniment
and its declamation of
lines in a cadence half way
between singing and
ordinary conversation, a
Kabuki performance is an
enchanting and dazzling
spectacle (photo left).
Yet the most important
aspect of a Kabuki play
is the acting. As a Kabuki
actor must learn to play
roles strictly according
to tradition, he needs
to begin training in
childhood. Since 1629,
when women were
forbidden to act in Kabuki
plays, female roles
have been taken by men,
even though the ban was
lifted in 1889.
The Kabuki theatre
repertory comprises about
300 classical plays, and
many modern ones,
including some adapted
from Western works.

BUNRAKU. Though it
originated in the 7th
century, the Japanese
Bunraku puppet theatre
became a true dramatic art
only three centuries ago
with the harmonious
blending of three dramatic
elements: puppet
actors, the Tayu or
narrator, and the Shamisen
player whose
three-stringed instrument
accompanies the recitation.
On the stage (left) each
puppet is manipulated by
three men. Unlike
Western puppet masters,
they are visible to the
audience, but are
gowned in
black (to signify
invisibility). Long training
enables them
to handle their
charges (often as tall as
a child and weighing
from six to
20 kilogrammes),
so as to convey the play's
every action and emotion.
Each Bunraku puppet is
an authentic work of art
in its own right.

### IGNORE

THEATRE
OF TIMELESS
TRADITION
NO. The Japanese Nô
play, a classical and
historical drama,
developed as the theatre
art of the Samurai (it was
the only theatrical
performance a
Samurai could attend).
The word "Nô," is
believed to be of Tibetan
origin. It signifies
"performance" or
"accomplishment."
Closely associated with the
Zen Buddhist philosophy,
the Nô play goes back
ten centuries, but its
major development began
in the 14th century.
The masked actors, the
chanting chorus and the
bare stage sets recall the
classic Greek theatre.
The plays are short and
their themes eulogise
gods, great warriors and
the virtues of patriotism
and loyalty. Few people
today can follow the
classical language of the
Nô play a mixture
of Chinese and oid
Japanese. The art of the
masked actor (right) lies
in his ability to impart
fine shades of meaning
by his movements
and gestures.

JAPAN'S CONTRIBUTION (Continued from page 30)
ant to contemporary Western art.
The relevance was brought home to
Pound when he received Ernest Fenol-
losa's notebooks in 1912. During his
long residence in Japan, Fenollosa had
examined the art of the country with
great care and to a lesser extent had
studied its language and literature.
Pound was fascinated by Fenollosa's
(mistaken) belief in the ideogrammatic
properties of the Chinese written char¬
acter and by the metaphrastic trans¬
lations of certain Nô plays which
Fenollosa had set down with Japanese
assistance. (It is not clear whether
Pound learned of his hokku from Fen¬
ollosa or not.)
Here was literature more relevant to
contemporary writing then the Europ¬
ean tradition. As W.B. Yeats put
it, the writers who created the
conventions of Nô were "more
like us even than Shakespeare
and Corneille. Their emotion was self-
conscious and reminiscent, always
associating itself with pictures and
poems."

HE second Impressionist
lesson the relevance of Japan to tech¬
nique was the one that Pound soon
began to practice and to teach, as it
were, under the three heads of hokku,
"ideogram," and "Nô." In a well
known article on Vorticism (Pound's
development of Imaglsm) in the "Fort¬
nightly" for September 1, 1914, he
recounted how he had responded (in
1911) to a scene in the Paris Metro
with a poem of thirty lines, which in
six months he reduced to half as
many, and which after another six
months he made into the following
hokku-like sentence:
The apparition of these faces in a
crowd;
Petals on a wet, black bough.
Citing the translation of a hokku, he
went on to say that "The one image
poem is a form of super-position; that
is to say it is one Idea set on top of
another." Essentially, Pound invented
a technique, modelled on hokku, in
which a vivid image is superposed on
a more discursive passage. Gentil-
donna gives a good example of the
technique of superposition.
She passed and left no quiver in
the veins, who now
Moving among the trees, and cling¬
ing in the air she severed,
Fanning the grasses she walked on
then, endures:
Grey olive leaves beneath a rain-
cold sky.
Gentildonna is not precisely a one-
image poem, but it does function
effectively in terms of the focus given
the first three verses by the fourth.
Hokku are very brief. They might
serve as models for brief poems or for
passages, but what relevance did Jap¬
anese poetry have to the long poem?
As Pound said in the "Fortnightly"
article: "I am often asked whether
there can be a long imagiste or vor-
ticist poem. The Japanese, who evolv¬
ed the hokku, evolved also the Nô
plays. In the best Nô, the whole
play may consist of one image. I mean
it is gathered about one image. Its
unity consists in one image, enforced
by movement and music. I see nothing
against a long vorticist poem."
Pound later called such a technique,
or phenomenon, "Unity of Image," and
Yeats wrote similarly of "a playing
upon a single metaphor" In Nô. The
concern with unity of technique and
sensibility which played so large a role
in the criticism of Pound, Yeats, and
Eliot was obviously inspired by a con¬
viction of disunity or "dissociation" in
contemporary experience.
To Pound, one of the few modern
poets to achieve a degree of success
with the long poem, unifying devices
were an obvious formal necessity in
a poem eschewing a straight narrative
line. In the Cantos there is not a single
unifying image nor even "Unity of
Image." But there are such unifying
images as the mountain, light, the
voyage, and the heavenly visitor. It
is almost inevitable that long poems
should have recurrent images, but
Pound consciously takes the essence
of a given ¡mage (the mountain-ness
of a mountain) rather than its particu¬
lar attributes (Mount Fuji, Vesuvius,
Taishan, etc.), as a passage shows:
The lake flowing away from the side
was still as Is never in Sirmio
With Fujiyama above it.
The passage shows, in addition to
the technique modelled along Japanese
lines, that Pound sometimes includes
Japanese details or illusions. In mak¬
ing them at once popular and a basis
for theory and technique, Pound suc¬
ceeded in doing for haiku and Nô what
the Impressionists had done for the
colour print.
In the years following World War I,
Western contacts with Japan multiplied.
Some still took their understanding of
Japan from prints and books, but others
took theirs from visits to Japan, from
visiting Japanese, or from a variety of
sources.
Among the Imagists following in
Pound's wake, there was for example
Amy Lowell, whose brother Perclval
represented the United States in cer¬
tain Asian countries. The colour prints
he sent home inevitably fused with
what she understood of haiku and
Japanese customs, enabling her to
provide her readers with (if it Is pos¬
sible) a well-informed exoticism.
Others were affected by visits to
Japan. Paul Claudel, ambassador of
France to Japan in the 1920s, found
kabuki a revelation, "for me a veritable
professional school of dramaturgy."
Since his play writing days were
largely past, it is not altogether clear
what he had learnt at that school, but

### 59109: Japan's contribution to Western literature and the arts

JAPAN'S CONTRIBUTION (Continued from page 34)
Exciting new ideas for poetry, theatre and cinema
he did achieve a signal success with
a play emulative of Kabuki, La Femme
et son ombre. He Is surely the only
Western writer to have a play per¬
formed twice (1923, 1929) in Japan
by a major Kabuki company.
Another visitor, whom the Japanese
have taken even closer to their hearts,
is the English poet and scholar,
Edmund Blunden. One will not often
find evident or exotic traces of Japan
in his work, but perhaps because of
that, Japan has played a part In lending
a new perception to the natural fine¬
ness of his writing: "I have written
many (poems since leaving Japan) in
which experience in Japan and
acquaintance with Japanese art and
poetry play a part though inconspic¬
uously."
Another English traveller to Japan,
William Plomer, should be mentioned
because he brought to his fiction and
poetry a sense of humour and a wit
very much lacking in most writing
about Japan.-
Sometimes Japan went west, as
when in 1928 the Kabuki company of
Ichikawa Sadanji visited the Soviet
Union and other countries. It could
not have arrived in Russia at a better
moment. Vsevold Meyerhold and Ser¬
gei M. Eisenstein in particular managed
both to grasp the principles of Japan¬
ese theatre and to devise from it
major innovations in cinematic tech¬
nique. Meyerhold had studied some
Japanese at the University of Moscow
just after World War One progressing
far enough to have a Poundian enthu¬
siasm for the "ideogram," which
attracted him by its supposed com¬
bination of artistic concreteness and
intellectual symbolism.
Eisenstein understood far better the
practical "language" of Kabuki theatre.
He grasped before anyone else in the
West the truth that the varied elements
in Kabuki also form a "monistic ensem¬
ble"; and that "elements of signifi¬
cance" (words, song, dance, etc.)
show a "transferring" "from one
category of 'provocation' (of the sen¬
ses) to another." Eisenstein's under¬
standing was remarkable enough, but
his greatness as a director and creator
of cinematic techniques gave his under¬
standing unusual, and highly influential,
significance.
Many Western film directors have
obviously learnt a good deal since the
1950s from such brilliant Japanese dir¬
ectors as Kurosawa Akira. More
than that, Japanese films have done
more to create an appreciation (if not
always an understanding) of Japanese
life and civilization than has any other
artistic form.
There is a generation that dates its
understanding of the cinema as an art
from Kurosawa's Rashômon »(Venice
Prize, 1951). And yet, decades before,
Eisenstein had articulated in theory
and demonstrated in practice the likely
possibilities for a cinema absorbing
traditional techniques of Japanese act¬
ing. It is the more appropriate that
Japanese films, so influential in the
West, should themselves owe a debt
to Eisenstein and that he should have
written knowingly (who else had?) on
Japanese films as early as 1929.
In France and Germany, Nô has
seemed more important than Kabuki.
As early as 1924, there were plans to
present a Nô directed by Suzanne
Bing, at Copeau's School at the Vieux-
Colombler. Highly successful re¬
hearsals were held, and the actual
performance was aborted only by the
Injury of a principal actor. Even the
sceptical Harley Granville-Barker was
impressed.
The partisanship of Paul Claudel for
Japanese theatre and the scholarly
French works on Nô by Noël Péri and
others continued to stimulate French
interest in both Nô and Kabukl. Char¬
les Dullin in his teaching and pro¬
ductions alike inculcated the virtues
of Japanese drama in his students,
among them Jean-Louis Barrault.
But it is a sobering and Illuminating
fact that the real article the Kanze
company of Nô that performed at the
Théâtre des Nations in 1957 was
neither understood nor appreciated.
Ten years later, English audiences
were perhaps more receptive but
almost as baffled when Nô was per¬
formed at an international theatre
festival in London.
IT seems to be true that to
be effective in the European theatre for
all but specialists, Japanese drama
must be accomodated, modernized,
or creatively misunderstood. Bertolt
Brecht was remarkably faithful (to
Arthur Waley's translation) in his two
versions of the Nô play Tanikô Der
Jasager and Der Neinsager but these
Lehrstücke have not been his most
popular plays.
Similarly, Gabriel Cousin adapted
the Nô play Obasuteyama for Le
Voyage de derrière la montagne (1962),
but he was far more successful in a
play using a Japanese subject, Le
Drame du Fukuryu Maru (1954-57; per¬
formed 1963). The subject is Japanese
or universal the problem of the
effects of radioactive fallout but the
technique is merely "Japanese."
Nô has also had particular appeal
in Germany, again thanks to careful
work by scholars. Eva Hesse's trans¬
lations (1963) of the Fenollosa-Pound
renderings of Nô have been performed
at a number of German theatres. After
they had been shown, it was easy for
the public to accept the "modern Nô
plays" of Mishima Yukio (Kindai Nôga-
kushû, written 1950-55) and then the
visit of the Kanze company. In spite
of its momentary popularity and its
deep impressions upon some German
directors, Nô, like most Japanese arts,
has had to date little apparent impact
upon Germany.
Postwar English interest in Japan has
also been disappointing to many peo¬
ple. Although there are very few
works to consider, by all odds the most
significant postwar work inspired by
Japanese literature or theatre is the
"church opera," Curlew River (1964),
the music by Benjamin Britten and the
libretto by William Plomer.
At Plomer's urging, Britten had
attended in Tokyo a performance of
the Nô, Sumidagawa. His enthusiastic
response led to an agreement that the
Japanese play would be transferred
from its medieval Buddhist setting to
a Christianized situation by the Curlew
River in East Anglia.
Britten and Plomer are at present
working on "two more works In the
same style The Burning Fiery Fur¬
nace, and The Prodigal Son." There is
no pretence that these "church op¬
eras" are faithfully Japanese, but as
one would expect from a composer of
such stature and a writer so familiar
with Japan, they are the more indirectly
indebted, and better, for that.
In the United States, Japanese
theatre, like many things Japanese, has
had a much more far-reaching effect.
It may be recalled that one of Giacomo
Puccini's most universally loved operas,
Madame Butterfly, grew from one of
the greatest successes in the Amer¬
ican theatre, David Belasco's Madame
Butterfly, itself based on an American
novel of that title published in 1897.
Since World War II,. Japanese
theatre has gained a reputation with
American directors, choreographers,
actors, and playwrights greater than
any other foreign tradition. There have
been visits of "Kabuki dancers," Kabu¬
ki proper, Nô, Bunraku, and even
Bugaku groups. At the University of
California, Los Angeles, there has
been a Gagaku orchestra for several
years, and other colleges or univers¬
ities have been performing bits of
Japanese plays or Yeats's "Nô plays"
since the early 1950s.
The major Japanese impact upon
American theatre has, however, center¬
ed upon the New York theatrical
world. Those most affected have been
those actors, choreographers, and
directors who do not so much write
plays as make theatre. The choreo¬
grapher Jerome Robbins, the ballet
director George Balanchine, the direc¬
tor Elia Kazan, and even the writer
Thornton Wilder are among those who
have adapted Japanese drama to their
purposes.
Interest has grown so strong among
those significantly involved in theatre
and dance in New York that Japanese

times. The "Ningyo"

### 59109: Japan's contribution to Western literature and the arts

JAPAN'S CONTRIBUTION (Continued)
Thirteen ways
of looking
at a blackbird'
methods have reached the summit of
esteem accorded the Stanislavsky
"method" years ago. In fact, it may
be thought that things have gone too
far.
It is one thing for Greta Garbo to
think Utaemon's New York perfor¬
mance in Dôjôji the greatest theatri¬
cal experience of her life; it is quite
another for directors to adapt essen¬
tially meaningless bits and pieces of
a now fashionable Japanese stage
technique.
The problem in the United States is,
then, quite different from that in other
countries. American theatrical circles
do not lack enthusiasm for Japanese
theatre, but often there is too little real
perception and creative discipline. It
may be that all would come right if
really significant playwrights emerged
at this moment. But what above all
distinguishes the genius of Japanese
theatre is that it is in large measure
the creation of perhaps the world's
most skilful actors.
The great postwar American Interest
in what are widely called "haiku and
Zen" resembles somewhat the French
interest about the time of World War I.
But there are differences, especially
those involving a more detailed back¬
ground and a greater American com¬
mitment to things Japanese. The back¬
ground is of course that of Pound and
those who followed him in particular
the post-lmagist "Others" group, which
included both Wallace Stevens and
William Carlos Williams.
Stevens approached Asian art and
literature, like all else, obliquely, but
his Thirteen Ways of Looking at a
Blackbird is the finest series of
"English haiku." His formal experi¬
mentation, involving some echoes from
specific Japanese poems, is accom¬
panied in this series of poems by a
transformation of that French inheri¬
tance of Impressionism and Symbolism
that Stevens so prized. The transform¬
ing process is akin to the transcenden¬
talism of earlier American enthusiasts
for the Orient in that the blackbird is
inter-related with its surroundings and
with the human observer.
In many ways, Williams presents an
objectivity opposed to this transcen¬
dence. Certainly the realities he treats
are often low-keyed. Yet there are
some points at which one would be
-o hard-pressed to identify the lines as
~ those of Stevens or Williams.

now that "Zen" consists of a partially
understood version of D.T. Suzuki's
partially modified version of Rinzai
Buddhism, which is but the second
largest group of Japanese Zen
Buddhism. "Zen" has provided a new
version of that transcendentalism and
individual protest against social forms
which would have been wholly con¬
genial to Ralph Waldo Emerson and
Henry David Thoreau in the nineteenth
century.
To such irrational or suprarational
transcendentalism, we must add objec¬
tivity and formalism as the chief
features of postwar poetry inspired by
Japan. The objectivity is owed to Wil¬
liams and to haiku (usually in trans¬
lations). The formalism is yet another
version of the Romantic search for
expressive form, whether in terms of
brief "English haiku" or lengthy serial
poems.
The combination of "haiku and Zen"
has meant that the best poets of this
kind have made every effort to find
their way by experience, by devotion
of their faculties and personalities in
a search for an illumination transpiring
at once in verse and within themselves.
It can be seen, therefore, that the
Impressionist or Poundian enthusiasm
for technique as such means much
less to them: if transcendental exper¬
ience can be gained, that is, object¬
ified, the desired form will come by
itself.
There are numerous other Americans
who write "haiku" or "tanka" or who
are interested in "Zen." Primary and
secondary school teachers often find
"haiku" in English an effective device
to stimulate their pupils to experiment
with poetry. Many institutions of
higher learning in the United States
offer lectures on Japanese literature
in translation. And the largest group
of scholars and teachers of Japanese
outside Japan sustains and nourishes
such interests.
Of course it is true that there is
no American poet who knows Japanese
as well as Dryden or Racine knew the
Graeco-Roman classics. And there is
some discrepancy between the under¬
standing of Japanese literature held by
the remarkable postwar generation of
American scholar-translators (who
nonetheless are not poets) and the
Japan-inspired poets (who nonetheless
inadequately comprehend Japanese).
Yet it is fitting that the Western coun¬
try closest to Japan in war and peace
should be the one to think Japan most
important to its scholarly and poetic
interests.
Years ago, C.S. Lewis remarked
that "the whole tone of medieval love
poetry can be explained by the for¬
mula, 'Ovid misunderstood'." Partial
understanding or misunderstanding is
inevitable in any effort to adopt cultural
features of another nation, especially
when the culture of that nation is, like
Japanese civilization, so closely guard¬
ed by its unique language and its
insular situation.

From the start of the Meiji era, the Japanese theatre
ventured beyond the bounds of tradition. In 1872,
two plays inspired by the work of the Scottish writer,
Samuel Smiles (one of Emperor Meiji's favourite authors)
were performed in Kyoto by actors in Western dress.
Soon, plays on contemporary themes as well as Western
classics were being produced. In 1912, the enthusiastic
reception given to Ibsen's "The Doll's House" and Gorki's
"The Lower Depths" in Tokyo's theatres marked the
opening of Japan to the mainstream of world theatre.

Is Bashô better known

But If no effort will insure full under¬

linguistic protection or geographical
isolation can now insure a culture
against being understood and mis¬
understood by other peoples. (It

ous political, economic, social, and

wealth of Japan is a sense of need
for what those riches are supposed to
contain.
The almost total indifference of our
novelists and short-story writers to
Japanese prose fiction is itself a
phenomenon that and this must be
insisted upon resembles French and
American enthusiasms for haiku in
telling us more about Western writers
than Japanese. It would be difficult to
guess from Western indifference to
Japanese prose fiction that it began
so early with The Tosa Diary (ca. A.D.
935) or that the greatest work of
Japanese literature is The Tale of
Genji (ca. 1010).
In other words, Western writers and
artists have turned to Japan for what
they needed, not necessarily for what
is there. Their Japanese counterparts
have of course done the same. It
would be as foolish to expect a full
understanding of another national cul¬
ture as it would be wrong to think no
gain in understanding has been reached
or to be content with what has been
gained. (After all, not many people
understand their own national artistic
inheritance very fully.)
B UT it is striking that where¬
as American poets, for example, have
scarcely seemed to notice Japanese
prose fiction, Japanese writers have
found pre-Soviet Russian fiction far
more to their use than American poetry.
There is, we must also recognize, a
social prestige attached to French
literature in Japan perhaps unmatched
by any other national tradition, and yet
the number of Japanese with adequate
command of French is very small.
Such matters show that the story
of Western borrowings from Japan is
one largely concerned with a Western
need to search out for what it was
felt was represented by Japan. All
considered, that meaning of Japan
(whether one that accords with reality
or not) has been much more important
than might reasonably have been
expected. A dim racial sense that the
origins of life are in the East, the
accidents of wars and geography, the
passing enthusiasms and sudden won¬
derful perceptions of possibility all
these and more mark the past century
of Western contact with Japan.
Fifty years ago there were probably
more Frenchmen who had heard of
Hokusai than of Phidias, and today
there are probably more Americans
who have heard of Bashô than of
Aristophanes. Whatever we may de¬
cide to be fit in such matters, we may
be sure that the American poet, like
the French painter, has discovered in
Japanese civilization that which gives
his art and life a special grace.

### 59219: Tokyo; a tale of two cities

TOKYO
A TALE
OF TWO CITIES
by William A. Robson
IOKYO epitomizes the
achievements of the century which
has passed since the Meiji Res¬
toration. It also reveals a city which
confronts some of the most severe
problems facing any great metropolis.
Prior to 1868 the city was called
Edo, possibly after a local warrior who
built a fort there. A small settlement
existed in the 12th century, but 1457
is generally regarded as the year in
which Edo's history begins because
it was then that Ota Dokan completed
the first castle on the site now
occupied by the Imperial Palace.
The castle had a position which
commanded the land and sea routes
from the Kanto plain to the west.
It was this strategic reason which led
leyasu Tokugawa to make the castle
his principal seat when he took it over
in 1590. When leyasu became Shogun
in 1603 Edo became the administrative
centre of his military government. The
Emperor remained at Kyoto with his
Court, but power had shifted to Edo.
Edo was a small fishing village until
the end of the 16th century. Then it
began to grow. The Shogun summon¬
ed some 80,000 Samurai warriors to
live in the city as his praetorian guard.
The feudal lords were required to
reside in the city every alternate year,
and when they went to their fiefs they
had to leave their wives and children
behind as hostages. This led to the
building of great houses, temples and
shrines in Edo, and craftsmen, trades¬
men, retainers and labourers crowded
into the city.
WILLIAM A. ROBSON is a leading authority
on urban planning. In 1967 he went to
Tokyo on the Invitation of the Tokyo
Metropolitan Government and the Tokyo
Institute for Municipal Research to advise on
the organization, planning and administration
of the city. Professor Robson, who has
been a consultant to the governments of
several countries, is Professor Emeritus of
Public Administration at the London School
of Economics and Political Science, and
former president of the International Political
Science Association. He is the author of
"The Government and Misgovernment of
London" (1948); "Great Cities of the World:
Their Government, Politics and Planning"
(1957); "Local Government in Crisis" (1966)
and "Politics and Government at Home and
Abroad" (1967), all published by George
Allen and Unwin, Ltd., London.
By 1613 the population had grown
to 150,000. In 1721 it was 1,300,000
and by the end of the 18th century it
had reached 1.5 million. This made
Edo larger than any other city in the
world except Peking. Since then fluc¬
tuations in the number of inhabitants
have been exceptionally great, partly
owing to natural disasters, and partly
owing to political, military and econo¬
mic events.
In 1868 a vital change of status was
brought about when Edo became the
capital of Japan in place of Kyoto.
The Emperor took up residence in
the castle, which became the Imperial
Palace, and the name of the city was
changed to Tokyo (Eastern Capital).
Modernization began with extra¬
ordinary rapidity: the telegraph was
introduced in 1869, the telephone in
1871, the steam train the following
year, gas street lights in 1874. Tokyo
University was founded in 1877. The
electric lamp made its appearance in
1878, and motorcars in 1903. The first
electric railway started in 1910.
Yet the immediate effect of the
Meiji Restoration on the size of the
city was a sharp fall in the population.
This was due to the exodus of the
dispossessed Samurai and the feudal
lords (daimyo) and their families; who
owned more than half of the city. In
1872 the population had fallen to a
little over half a million and it did not
reach a million again until about 1880.
The seeds of rapid growth were,
however, germinating, for Tokyo soon
became an industrial, commercial,
financial and cultural centre as well
as the political and administrative
capital. The population rose to
3,358,000 in 1920 and 7,358,000 in
1943. These figures are not all
strictly comparable because the admin¬
istrative boundaries were enlarged in
1932 from 85 square kilometres to
554 square kilometres. Today the area
is 2,029 square kilometres.
Tokyo contains the seat of the
Emperor, the national legislature, the
central government and the highest
courts of justice. It is the greatest
manufacturing, commercial, and finan¬
cial centre. It has the headquarters
of the national newspapers and peri¬
odicals, and the publishing, broadcast-

TOKYO (Continued)
Population 11 million, increasing yearly by 300,000
ing and television organs. The lead¬
ing theatres, both traditional and
modern, are situated there. The rail¬
way system radiates from Tokyo. It
is the centre for sport and athletics.
Tokyo University occupies a position
of special primacy in higher education,
and more than a third of all the col¬
leges and universities in Japan are
located there. Tokyo is above all the
centre of management for all branches
of Japanese life. It is, of course, not
supreme in every respect. Yokohama
is far superior as an ocean port.
Osaka and Nagoya excel in some
branches of industry.
Tokyo has undergone frequent and
severe vicissitudes from fires and
earthquakes. Two great disasters
occurred in the present century. One
was the earthquake of 1923 which
caused the death of 74,000 persons
and destroyed the homes of two-thirds
of the survivors. The other was the
destruction caused by air raids during
the Second World War. About
770,000 houses (roughly half of the
total) were destroyed, the devastated
area exceeded 39,000 acres, and the
sufferers numbered three million, in¬
cluding 100,000 killed and 130,000
wounded. The population dropped
from over seven million to three and
a half million in 1945.
Since then it has risen by more than
300,000 a year and has now reached
a total in excess of 11 million. This
makes Tokyo the world's largest city.
The influx was for some years com¬
posed of returning soldiers, evacuees
and expatriates; but in the last decade
more and more people have flocked
to the capital in search of employment.
Natural increase has also added a
substantial element.
No other great city has grown so
fast. Moreover, the full extent of Its
growth is not revealed by the figures
set out above because these relate
only to the area of the Tokyo Metro¬
politan Government. The present
administrative boundaries were deter¬
mined in 1947, and as in the case of
most great cities the population has
flooded over them.
I
HE modern history of the
government of Tokyo dates from 1889
when 15 wards were incorporated in
the City of Tokyo. For nearly a decade
the city was administered by a
Governor of Tokyo Prefecture who
was appointed by the central govern¬
ment. In 1898 the city council was
given the right to elect a mayor but
the capital remained under the super¬
vision of the Prefectural Governor and
the Minister of Home Affairs.
In 1943 the Prefecture was merged
with the City, which then became the
Metropolis of Tokyo, combining the
powers of a prefecture with those of
a city. Numerous wards were added
to the original 15 and the number is
at present 23. Apart from the special
wards the metropolis includes 17 cities,
13 towns and two villages, together
with three islands in Tokyo Bay.
Within the special ward areas, which
contain nearly nine million people,
Tokyo Metropolitan Government exer¬
cises the major powers of a metro¬
politan authority. There is a lower tier
of elected councils in each of the
special wards performing minor func¬
tions, but they are subordinate to the
Tokyo Metropolitan government. Out¬
side the special wards this authority
exercises only the powers of a pre¬
fecture.
The people of Tokyo have had a
long struggle for self-government
against the central government. Their
greatest victory was in 1947 when the
office of governor was made elective
by the direct vote of the people. Even
today there remains a certain danger
of central domination.
Tokyo is the wealthiest city in Japan.
The average income per head in the
capital is twice the national average
and three times as high as in the poor
farming districts. "The capital contains
about 11 per cent of the nation and it
produces 20 per cent of the national
income. The Japanese economy has
been growing in recent years at a
faster rate than that achieved by any

other nation at any time, and much of
this has been generated in Tokyo, the
hub of the economic machine.
The tremendous vitality of the capi¬
tal is visible on every side. There are
new luxury hotels, new theatres, new
railway stations, new office blocks,
new department stores, the vast stad¬
ium and swimming pool built for the
Olympic games, new metropolitan
freeways, a fast monorail to the airport,
the first skyscraper ever permitted in
Japan, the new super-express railway
to Osaka running at 200-250 kilometres
an hour, and the impressive new
managerial sub-centre at Shinjuku with
vast underground roads, shopping ar¬
cades and parking facilities. Motor
cars pour off the assembly line at a
rate which has placed Japan second
among the automobile producing coun¬
tries of the world.
Yet below the surface there are
serious deficiencies which have not
been overcome. The housing situation
in Tokyo is bad for the low income
groups and ¡twill remain unsatisfactory
unless much stronger measures are
introduced to restrict profiteering in
land. There is a need also for public
authorities to provide many more
dwellings for the poorer families.
Only 30 per cent of the special ward
area has sewerage, and flush toilets
are in use in only 27.6 per cent of the
buildings. A piped water supply is
available in 90 per, cent of the houses
in the special ward area but in three
wards the proportion is much lower.
Outside the special wards the overall
figure is only 64 per cent. Moreover,
a piped water supply does not imply
a regular supply day and night
throughout the year.
P
UBLIC nuisances, such as
air pollution, flooding, river pollution,
fumes from motor cars, etc. are not
effectively controlled. The torrent of
motor cars pouring off the assembly
lines has produced a traffic problem of
immense difficulty, which is exacerbat¬
ed by an absence of parking meters
and an exceptionally low ratio of road
space to the metropolitan territory (1).
The public transport system is
grossly overloaded and is divided
among public authorities and commer¬
cial companies. Its capacity is far
below that required1 to cope with the
exceptionally heavy commuter traffic.
In several respects the social devel¬
opment and the basic infrastructure of
Tokyo have not kept pace with the
increase of population and the growth
of the economy.
There are several reasons for this
imbalance. The excessively heavy
influx of population would have over¬
strained the resources of any great
city. But the huge industrial, com¬
mercial and cultural development of
Tokyo demanded a much larger in¬
vestment in public services than has
been forthcoming, especially for health,
housing, education, public utilities,
transport and green spaces.

HE central government has
failed to provide Tokyo Metropolitan
Government with the financial resour¬
ces and the powers needed to enable
it to cope with the pressing problems
of the postwar years. Vital matters
such as the rocketing price of land,
the planning of the Tokyo region, the
expansion of the city boundaries, the
development of counter-magnets in
other parts of the country, a more
generous system of subsidies and
loans for municipal purposes, have
either been neglected or dealt with
ineffectively.
Despite its problems, Tokyo repre¬
sents a massive achievement by any
standard. It is a modern city embody¬
ing many feats of design, technology
and construction which are highly
esteemed in the modern world.- It
must be compared, not with the squalid
and poverty stricken cities of Asia but
with the centres of wealth, fashion and
luxury of Western Europe and North
America.
And it contains within itself that
fascinating and unique feature of Jap¬
anese society: the dual culture. One
sees, the technical perfection of the
Tokaido express railway, the marvels
of modern radio and television fac¬
tories, the ingenious design of the
latest department store building, the
Festival Concert Hall, a highly accom¬
plished national press, the stainless
steel station at Shinjuku, a splendid
exhibition of Utrillo's paintings, and
many other manifestations of Western
science and art.
One also sees the Nô theatre and
the Kabuki, the ancient Shinto shrines
and Buddhist temples, the kimonos
and the traditional wedding costumes,
the lovely gardens, the incense burning
ceremonies, the tea ceremony, the
flower arranging art, the Japanese-style
houses, rooms and customs which
have persisted through long centuries.
Nowhere else can one see ancient
and modern cultures co-existing in this
way without merging. The result is
a triumph for what has been achieved
since the Meiji Restoration. It is also
a tribute to what was achieved before
that important event.

The transformation of Tokyo began in the Meiji era, when a rash of
new buildings spread outwards from the city centre. An outstanding
landmark was Japan's first "skyscraper" (right). Its 12 stories, including
three observation towers, were crowned by a cupola 225 feet above
the ground. With its restaurants, theatres and the first elevator to be
seen in Japan, it immediately became the country's, most popular
amusement centre, as shown in this humorous print of the time. Japan's
first authentic skyscraper (36 stories) was built in Tokyo in 1967.

HE city of ten million
inhabitants is an organism which has
appeared only in the latter half of the
present century, and as such it is a
historical hovelty. Tokyo, New York,
London, Paris and Moscow have
passed or are fast approaching the
ten million mark. To remain alive and
grow they must have the mobility and
structure befitting our modern times.
"The technological revolution of the
late 20th century has resulted in a
shift in the city from factory and
industrial occupations to tertiary
occupations such as sales and services
which have become the pivotal
functions of the large metropolis of
today. The mass introduction of
automobiles into the city has further¬
more completely altered the relation¬
ship between streets and buildings.

Aerial view of Kenzo Tange's bold plan for
the Tokyo of tomorrow, distributed along
a central civic axis across Tokyo Bay.
Axis is divided into a series of ring units
or cycles to house commercial and other
offices. A three-level road system each
with ten lanes is envisaged for vehicles
travelling at 60, 90, and 120 kilometres/hour,
and would permit a flow of 200,000 cars
an hour, far higher than any highway
system now in existence. Clusters
extending perpendicularly from axis over
Bay are residential areas (seen also in
photo page 56). Two airports can be seen
in Bay, one for national traffic, the other
for international flights. Far left of Bay
would be reserved for industrial zones.
Left, Tange (holding baton) in one of his
workshops.
Paris and other large cities are being
strangulated and paralyzed by a
structure that dates back to the Middle
Ages. This is the centripetal or radial
pattern in which all traffic moves
toward the centre of the city.
"There is only one way to save
Tokyo and that is to create a new
urban structure, a new spatial order,
in which the urban system, the traffic
system, and the architectural system
of the city are organically unified. We
have proposed that the antiquated
radial structure of Tokyo be replaced
by an elongated linear axis of
communication, to be developed out
across Tokyo Bay."
The man speaking is Kenzo Tange,
one of the world's most celebrated
and imaginative architects, with a long
list of honours and awards to his
credit.
He has won international recognition
for his designs for the Peace Memorial
Hall in Hiroshima, the Tokyo City Hall,

Below, view of portion of residential area over Tokyo Bay. Each unit would
be composed of a platform with the buildings rising above it like curved triangles,
leaving the centre free for shopping centres, parks and squares, car parks, schools,
etc. At certain levels concrete platforms would extend from side to side to house
gas, water and electricity lines. On these platforms each individual could build
a house to his own taste. Tange estimates that over 5 million persons could be
housed in these residential areas. One side of central axis can be seen at right
showing cyclical roads forming a chain turning right and left and crossing up and
down at cubic crossings. Each of the axis roads is thus a complete circle. Above,

as "a superb fusion of the technology
of modern architecture and Japanese
traditional elements." He is the
Architectural Director for EXPO '70,
the first world exposition to be held
in Asia, and has just completed the
master plan for the exhibition grounds
on Osaka's northeastern suburbs.
The author of books on the Katsura
Imperial Villa, the Grand Shrines at
Ise, and other masterpieces of
Japanese architecture, Kenzo Tange is
also professor of architecture at Tokyo
University.
The 54-year-old architect maintains
his off-the-campus offices and work¬
shops on the two top floors of a seven
storey building only a few streets
away from one of his most celebrated
creations the National Gymnasium, a
monumental piece of architecture
acclaimed by the participants at the
Tokyo Olympic Games in 1964.
This imposing structure, with its
gigantic sloping roof, reflects Tange's
aspiration for an architecture in har¬
mony with the magnitude, rhythm and
energy of the large modern metroplis.
Although the shape of the building is
extremely modern, Japanese and
foreign architects have seen in the
two interlocked arcs of the National
Gymnasium and the spiral annex of
the Small Gymnasium next to it,
symbolic crests of traditional Japan.
The beauty and originality of the
edifice won him the Olympic Diploma
of Merit.
F<OR years Kenzo Tange's
main concern has been with archi¬
tecture in its relationship with urban¬
ization. His counsel has been sought
by city planners in Europe and
America. In 1965, the Yugoslav
Government chose his blueprint for
the reconstruction of earthquake-
devastated Skopje, and a completely
new city is now emerging on the
site of the capital of Macedonia
according to his plan, under a 15-year
project. He is currently at work with
Italian experts on a new plan for the
city of Bologna in northern Italy.
Tange's "Plan for Tokyo", first put
forward in 1960, offers a revolutionary
approach to modern urbanization,
viewed not in terms of mere
architectural form or even a complex
architectural ensemble but as a civic
axis of communication. It is this
communication axis that Kenzo Tange
sees as the heart and symbol of the
contemporary metropolis, just as the
cathedral was the heart and symbol
of the city of the Middle Ages.
"In an age when cities developed
around central squares or plazas,"
Professor Tange explained to this
writer, "when people lived within the
limits prescribed by regional societies,
the central square was the nucleus of
communication, and the cathedral, the
castle and the city hall were the
spiritual supports well as the
symbols of urban life. Horses and

Spinal column for an ocean city

past rows of buildings must have
formed a very harmonious ensemble."
But now, he points out, mass
communication "has released the city
from the bonds of a closed
organization, and is changing the
structure of the city Itself. In the
society with an open organization, and
in the large metropolis which is the
pivot of this organization, the mobility
required for individual communication
is assuming ever larger proportions.
This, added to the ebb and flow of
commuters into the centre of town
every day, has led to the extreme
confusion and paralysis we are
witnessing in the large cities of
today."
If the various functions of a great
city were distributed along a line,
Tange points out, communications
linking them could be carried out in
a minimum of time by movement along
that line.
The linear axis would start from the
present centre of Tokyo and gradually
extend out in a series of cycles or
units over the waters of Tokyo Bay
until it linked up, in the final stage,
with the opposite shore.
The pivotal functions of the city
would be concentrated along the
central axis. Highways would be
suspended about 40 metres above the
ground and 50 metres above Tokyo
Bay. In other words, the highways
would be huge suspension bridges
running above the buildings with
supporting piers at intervals of
one kilometre.
A,L three-level transportation
system is envisaged in Kenzo Tange's
plan, each with ten lanes, for vehicles
moving at 60, 90 and 120 kilometres
an hour. The lowest (slowest) level
would have one link per kilometre
along the axis, the second level a link
every three kilometres (a monorail
suspended from this level is also
foreseen), and the third level a link
every nine kilometres. Traffic at all
Interchange points would move in the
same direction on all levels.
This system would permit a flow
of 200,000 cars per hour ten to thirty
times more than any high-speed
highway system now in existence. As
many as five million persons could
move along the axis in a single day
by using the various means of
transportation, which would fulfil the
needs of the 15 million inhabitants
Tokyo is expected to have in the next
twenty years.
To free the centre of Tokyo from
its present congestion, the monorail
lines would be linked to underground
and railroad station interchanges along
the axis. The construction of a large
new railroad station on the axis is
also foreseen.
A system of streets would extend
out from the axis in parallel lines,
leading into residential areas. This
can be clearly seen in the districts
built over the Bay of Tokyo (see photo
page 56). Tange foresees that within
twenty years some 5,000,000 people
will be living on the bay. Some of
the residential areas would stand on
reclaimed land, others on platforms
supported by piers sunk directly into
the ocean floor.
By building on the bay, Tange feels,
the people of Tokyo would rediscover
the sea, since Tokyo, which has lost
most of its coastal areas to factories,
would again become a seaside city.
"In this way," he says, "the ocean
would become not only a symbol of
our economic development but a
pleasant part of our daily environ¬
ment." In a sense therefore, Tange's
project calls for the creation of a new

archipelago on the scale of the modern
metropolis.
Tange's revolutionary plan for the
transformation of the radial city into
a linear metropolis along a central
civic axis has been inspired not only
by an analysis of the many complex
problems of modern urbanization but
by a detailed study of the evolution
and growth of living organisms in
nature.
The amoeba and other simple
organisms, he points out, have radial
centripetal forms, but more advanced
organisms such as the vertebrates
have linear bone structures with
parallel radiations.
Illl
HEN the living functions
of organisms differentiate and perform
the composite functions of life," he
explains, "the centripetal pattern
evolves into a system of parallel lines
grouped around an axis formed of
a spine and arteries. In like manner,
the process whereby a vertebrate body
hatches from an egg illustrates the
possibility of gradual development on
the part of a linear system."
Tange sees the city as a living,
growing organism which must be
flexible and expandable as its pattern
of life grows, becomes more complex
and expands. His civic axis system
is composed of unit cycles not unlike
the vertebrae in the spine. At each
stage of development the system is
complete, but it is always possible to
add other units.
Since elaborating his original plan
for the Tokyo metropolis in 1960,
Kenzo Tange has been closely studying
the most recent phenomenon of our
time the development of an even
higher complex of urban civilization:
the megalopolis. The growth of the
megalopolis in the world of tomorrow
is inevitable, he feels, with the rapid
rise in world population and the
increasing complexity of modern life.
"Thirty or forty years from now much
of the population of our planet will be
living in such huge urban complexes,"
he says.
Already Tokyo and Yokohama form
one large urban mass, with snarled
traffic making rapid communication
between the two centres well nigh
impossible. Already, too, thousands
of persons are commuting daily
between Osaka and Tokyo, over
300 miles (500 kilometres) away. The
day will soon come, he says, when
the whole area between Tokyo and
Osaka will form one vast megalopolis,
to which he refers as the "Tokaido
megalopolis."
The civic axis principle is the one
way, Tange maintains, to meet this
evolving situation and to avoid the
indescribable chaos which will surely
ensue if the radial-type megalopolis
is allowed to form. By adding unit
cycles, the Tokyo civic axis could
eventually be extended all the way to
Osaka to form one of the major
elements of
megalopolis.
the future Tokaido
T,ODAY we must face the
fact, Tange says, that the civilization
and economy of the world are about
to undergo a tremendous development,
and this demands a more dynamic style
to match the realities of the modern
metropolis. Urban architecture should
give an impression equal to such
colossal civil engineering projects as
super-highways, highspeed traffic
intersections, and the congested
population.
Today, he points out, our environ¬
ment has three scales: the human
scale, the mass human scale, and the
superhuman or technological scale.
Man himself continues to walk in steps
of a metre or so, to talk face to face
with his neighbours, and we are still
surrounded by the human scale which
can never change no matter how much
technology changes.

Architecture matched to the speed
and scale of our times
The plazas, cathedrals and small
houses of the Middle Ages had a mass
human scale which was suited to the
masses of the people gathered in the
urban centres, and harmonized with
the human scale of roads radiating
from them.
Today, however, huge highways,
carrying high-speed traffic have
introduced themselves into the old
system. They represent the super¬
human, technological scale which in
no way harmonizes with the archi¬
tecture of the late 19th century and
the first half of the 20th. When we
consider that our highways are built
for speeds exceeding 100 kilometres
an hour and our airports for speeds
scaled at 1,000 kilometres an hour, the
vastness of the new structures ceases
to seem vast.
But the individuality, freedom and
spontaneity of the human scale, Tange
points out, form an ever-increasing
antithesis to the superhuman tech¬
nological scale. Man desires more
and more to exercise his own
individual choice in matters concerning
houses, gardens, streets and plazas.
There are, therefore, two conflicting
extremes the major technological
structures, which while restricting
individual choice determine the system
of our new age, and the minor objects
used in our daily living which permit
the expression of free individual
choice. "The gap between the two,"
Tange says, "is gradually growing
deeper."
The important task before the
contemporary architect and designer
is to create a harmonious relationship,
an organic link, between these two
extremes, and thereby build a new
spatial order for our contemporary
cities.

N our plan," Tange con¬
tinued, there would be an order of pro¬
gression from the house to the play¬
ground for children, to the space for
quiet gatherings, to large open spaces,
to large-scale recreation and sports
centres; from schools to other
educational and cultural installations;
and from parking areas to trans¬
portation plazas to superhighways.
"Shopping areas, auditoriums and
the like would be distributed around
the surface of each unit area on the
same human scale as at present, and
there would be small streets for
pedestrians as well as large and small
plazas for crowds. These spaces
would be identical with the historical,
human spaces now in our cities. Our
plan, in effect, would provide for
architecture which would be compatible
with the speed and scale of our times
but which at the same time would
permit the continuation of our
historical urban life."
According to Tange, tradition in
culture and architecture is adapted to
the human scale, and would be very
much out of place if used on the super¬
human technological scale of super¬
highways, airport structures, etc.
It is 'within this framework that we
can better understand the change in
Kenzo Tange's thinking in the past
twelve years with regard to the place
of tradition in Japanese architecture.
T ANGE has often been
described as the outstanding Japanese
architect who has "succeeded in ac¬
complishing the union of the Japanese
tradition with modern architecture." In
1956, he published an article entitled:
"Creation in Present-Day Architecture
and the Japanese Architectural Trad¬
ition," which created quite a stir
amongst both Japanese and foreign
architects because of the negative
opinions he expressed about Japanese
tradition. He explained his ideas to
this writer in the following way:
"Immediately after the Second World
War and up to the mid 1950s Japan
struggled to rebuild its economic and
physical structure. The thinking of
our people was backward-looking,
fixed on our ancient traditions and the
history of the past. In this atmos¬
phere, Japanese architects felt we
could not fulfil the people's spiritual
needs unless our architecture was
inspired by Japan's ancient traditions.
"But in discussing tradition in
Japan we architects came to realize
that there existed two distinct types
of tradition in our country "an upper
current" and "an under current." The
upper current tradition stemmed from
the nobility and aristocratic" circles, in
other words, from the upper- classes
of society, and found expression in
their palaces, castles and other
traditional residences, as well as their
gardens.
"The under current tradition sprang
from the people. It can be found in
the brightly coloured local festivals
that enliven every town of Japan, and
in the dynamic shapes of Japanese
farmhouses and village homes.
"To most Americans and Europeans
and indeed many Japanese only
the upper current represents the
traditional art and culture of Japan.
But the under current tradition has
a vital, dynamic quality of its own,
and a richness which contrasts
markedly with the shapes and forms
of the upper current tradition."
Tange went on to explain that
Japanese art historians have not paid
much attention to this under current,
and Japanese architects took their
chief inspiration, up until about 1955,
chiefly from the upper current forms.
"But the ordinary people of Japan
have under current backgrounds," he
went on, "and cannot fully respond to
the upper current traditional forms.
At this point, I began asking myself
what the function of tradition in
architecture really was."
Tange stopped for a moment, and
then added quickly. "I myself believe
that tradition by itself cannot be
creative power. I sometimes compare
tradition to a chemical reaction. It
should act like a catalytic agent to
create something new, but the
traditional form or inspiration should
not be visible in the finished product."
And he concluded with the following
words:
"The Japanese economy has now
changed its structure.- With it our
social structuré and Institutions have
also changed. And most important,
the attitude of the Japanese people is
now forward-looking not backward-
looking. Formerly, everything In Japan
was done by following the past. But
we have now entered a new age, a
technological civilization, where looking
ahead to tomorrow is much more
realistic than turning back to yesterday.
For tomorrow will be a different,
changed world. We cannot seek a
solution to our new problems just by
following the pattern of the past. And
the architect in society cannot do so
either. He too must look ahead."
P ROFESSOR Teijiro Mura-
matsu has perhaps summed up the
thinking of Kenzo Tange and other
contemporary Japanese architects
when he said:
"Japan now finds herself faced with
the new problem of working out the
shift into a completely new society . . .
Japanese designers, architects, and
the people as a whole are giving as
much, if not more, sincere thought to
the new Japanese society and the
development of the Japanese culture
as they devote to industrial growth.
We have experienced periods of
copying foreign models and periods
of nationalistic reaction . . .but ' from
now on we have no models. We must
face the problem of the new and
unknown ourselves and work out our
own plan. One hundred years after
the Meiji Restoration, we stand at the
starting line of a new modernization
process."

An imaginative quest
for new solutions marks
the development
of Japan's modem
architecture.
Its striking success is
seen in the wealth of
ideas and the
aesthetic and functional
harmony evld»ent
in many recent buildings.
From some, a clear
line of development runs
back to old Japanese
architectural tradition,
with today's designers
composing new
variations on many
an old theme. One
example is the
youth hostel,

in a grandiose mountain
setting by Motoo
Take. There is a striking
likeness between its
reinforced concrete
roof and the
high-gabled thatched
roofs of 5th and
6th century Japanese
houses, as shown by the
clay house, top left,

sculpture.

of integrating trees,

as architectural
elements.

.
HOKKAIDOfrontier land of the Far North
Our "Far West" is how the
Japanese describe Hokkaido,
their country's northernmost and
second largest island only
a century ago a wild and barren
land. Hokkaido's first
step to modernization was
taken at the start of the Meiji
era through the efforts
of pioneer settlers and the
launching of development
programmes to tap
its rich natural resources.
The results are seen today In
Hokkaido's burgeoning
industrial cities, busy steel
plants and mining sites, lumber
industries (including the
world's largest newsprint mill)
and flourishing agricultural
and fishing industries. Only one
hour by air from Tokyo
(left, plane leaves snow-
covered Kushiro airport),
Hokkaido is to be linked to
Honshu, Japan's main island, by
a 37 kilometre-long rail
tunnel. On completion in 1975
it will be the world's
longest undersea tunnel. Right,

### 59224: Unrest and promise of Japan's youth

Unrest and promise of
JAPAN'S YOUTH
s,ITUDENT unrest is a pheno¬
menon that has been sweeping across
virtually every part of the world in
the past few years. But it seems
to have had its first violent mani¬
festations in Japan eighteen years
ago. In 1950, Tokyo students, in a
burst of violence, took over the main
university buildings and locked up their
faculty deans, to protest their fears
that "Japan would again become in¬
volved in a war."
This article, which discusses some of the
major problems of youth in Japan today, is
based on commentaries by several authori¬
ties who have studied these problems af first
hand. Among these observers are the Japa¬
nese writer, Michio Takeyama, author of the
prizewinmng novel, "Harp of Burma", and
the well-known Japanese youth leader, Sa-
buro Nagai, who is a member of the Japanese
National Commission for Unesco.
With these and subsequent de¬
monstrations, the notion of "student
power" was born in Japan. These
events occurred when Japan was still
a poor country barely recovering from
the Second World War, and it is
consequently difficult to agree with
the statement often made that "student
power" is the product of an affluent
society. Moreover, other nations, re¬
cently shaken by student uprisings, are
still a very long way from prosperity.
Japanese student unrest may per¬
haps be traced to the drastic changes
that took place in Japanese society
after the end of World War II. During
the war, every effort had been made
in Japan to build up a monolithic sys¬
tem of society. The vast reservoir of
moral power, springing from the depths
of Japanese history, was mobilized in
this effort. Then, with defeat, came an
agonizing atmosphere of shame. It
became the fashion for Japanese to
reject every aspect of their own
country, to compare it unfavourably
with the Utopian concept they had of
other nations. For a time, the Japan¬
ese people almost completely lost
their mental balance.
Japanese society has since righted
itself, but so far it has not found a
formula to guide youth in a rational
manner . The problems of Japan's
young people, therefore are in a
sense the problems of Japan's adults.
The difficulties and perplexities of
youth stem from the world shaped by
their elders. And if adults cannot
properly pave the way for the younger

### 59224: Unrest and promise of Japan's youth

JAPAN'S YOUTH (Continued)
In search of peace and a better world
66
generations, youth can hardly be blam¬
ed for the deterioration of society.
At a time when the older genera¬
tions are unable to find common
grounds for understanding in the in¬
volved international relationships of
modern societies, it is small wonder
that the young are agitated and con¬
fused. They aspire to the ideals of
friendship and peace which are natural
to all mankind. But when they seek
to attain these ideals promptly and
find the road blocked, they react
sometimes violently against the ob¬
stacles which stand before them.
No single person has the answers
to the big problems of today; no
curriculum can be devised that would
eliminate all the impatient misgivings
of youth, Nevertheless, we must strive
to understand what is behind youth's
dissatisfaction, and give them confid¬
ence that society will make every
effort to solve the , difficult prob¬
lems ahead.
At the same time, this sympathetic
understanding of adults does not nec¬
essarily mean giving way to "appease¬
ment" or total abandon, nor that viol¬
ence as such can be countenanced as
a part of this "understanding" process.
The emergence of this generation
with its own values and culture is
making communication between older
and younger generations, teachers
and students, parents and children,
employers and employees, increasing¬
ly difficult. Instead of the dialogue
that is needed, conflicts take place
that intensify the differences rather
than resolve them.
Such estrangements deepen youth's
sense of insecurity, and when conflict
between older and younger genera¬
tions is complicated by irreconciliable
ideological views or the dissensions
that divide the present-day world, the
situation worsens, as is often the case
in Japan.
Part of the explanation for the speed
with which the current wave of student
unrest has radiated throughout the
world might be attributed to our rapid
means of communications. Nowadays,
television and other media transmit
the news to all parts of the world
immediately. Youth in different coun¬
tries, influenced by what they have
seen, read or heard, react in similar
fashion even though the conditions
may be essentially different from those
where the original spark was struck.
In this way a sort of chain reaction of
disturbances may be set up in many
societies where resort to violence is
considered likely to produce results.
For the Japanese college freshman,
participation in a virile student move¬
ment often has an aura of coming
of age attached to it. It is, as it
were, a "rite de passage," a stage
in the awakening to the world around
him. But when, after graduation, he
leaves the university to pursue his
professional or business life, he usual¬
ly settles down within the framework
of the society he had so recently
attacked. This, at least, is what has
happened in Japan.
T HE number of students
now engaged in violent manifestations
in Japan is on the decline, but those
who remain are campaigning more
aggressively than before, no doubt
encouraged by similar movements in
other parts of the world.
The causes to which they rally more
often than not touch their deep human-
itarianism; they demonstrate against
atomic weapons and war in all its
aspects, reflecting not only their own
aspirations for a better world but also
the general aversion of the Japanese
to armed conflict. There can be no
doubt, however, that political elements
and ideologies play an important role
too. The stormy "Zengakuren" (Nation¬
al Federation of Student Self-Govern¬
ment Associations), which has astound¬
ed the world with its extremely violent
demonstrations, is a case in point.
Police intervention on university
campuses, which the students regard
as a sort of sanctuary, has become
an acute issue in present-day Japan.
University authorities who have called
in the police to counter student
demonstrations of violence, have been
denounced even by many moderate
elements of the student body for what
Is considered "a violation of the
students' extra-territorial rights."
Recently, the entire student body of
Tokyo Imperial University went on
strike. The trouble began in the
Faculty of Medicine. Medical students
are required to take a six-year study
course followed by one year of
internship. After passing the national
examination, the intern becomes a
qualified doctor.
In the past Interns worked without
payment, and the medical students
asked the government authorities to
work out a fair compensation scale.
A new system of Registered Doctors
has been worked out for students who
have passed the national examination
to intern for two years at one of
216 designated hospitals in the coun¬
try with an allowance ranging from
12,500 to 25,000 Yen ($40 to $70) per
month.
The medical students consider this
very meagre, and ara also demanding
better equipped hospitals and facilities
for research work. With these and
other questions still unsolved, the
chances of classes opening on
schedule for the autumn semester
seem doubtful.
The increase in the number of uni¬
versity students has given rise to
many problems. The phenomenal jump
in the birth rate immediately after the
war created a population wave that is
now cresting at the college level. In

### 59224: Unrest and promise of Japan's youth

spite of tremendous efforts made by
the Government to increase classroom
capacity and the number of teachers,
the student-vacancy ratio in the spring
of 1968 was about five to one. A
leading newspaper predicted earlier
this year that about 280,000 candidates
would be denied admittance to colle¬
ges and universities in March 1968,
and that most would probably try
again next year, further swelling the
number of candidates.
Thus far, reference has been made
to problems affecting students and
of the "student power" movement. As
far as other young people are
concerned, there are relatively fewer
problems. Japan has its juvenile delin¬
quency headaches just as other coun¬
tries have. But for the first time in
recent years the country has achieved
a state of full employment, and the life
of working people has improved and
stabilized to a remarkable degree.
If one judges everything by a Utop¬
ian yardstick (as students are often
inclined to do), measures which par¬
tially improve a situation are Insuffi¬
cient because they never close the
gap between reality and the ideal. In
other words, anything less than
complete improvement has no signifi¬
cance. However, for the working
youth of Japan, the -yardstick is a
concrete measure to be used to im¬
prove reality.
Japan has undergone important
changes in the past twenty years, but
the people's traditional sense of
values continues to form the basis for
the country's development. The Em¬
peror remains the symbol of national
unity; the old family system has been
abolished, but the family remains an
important unit of society; allegiance to
the company or organization one works
for, not unlike the feeling towards
one's family, is still considered
a characteristic of Japanese society
today. Women, who have had the
right to vote since the end of the war,
and are playing an increasing role in
many domains, remain faithful to the
family. Girls wearing bikinis at the
beaches shock no one except very
old-fashioned people. Everything,
including the relationship between men
and women, has become free and open.
Hence, it is possible to say that
the way of thinking and fundamental
approach to life of the Japanese people
has not undergone as total a change
as some persons think. The tradition¬
ally industrious character of Japan has
developed and strengthened in the
past twenty years. This homogeneous
island nation with few parallels in the
world has been formed over several
thousand years, and this tradition is
unlikely to crumble easily.
w
I T H the growth and
expansion of Japan's industrial society,
young people have converged upon
the big cities and industrial areas of
Japan as never before. Half of Japan's
youth are now concentrated in these
areas, and two-thirds of the total stu¬
dent population are enrolled In univer¬
sities and colleges in six big cities
Tokyo, Yokohama, Nagoya, Kyoto,
Osaka and Kobe. Along with urbani¬
zation and industrialization, the occup¬
ational distribution of Japan's youth
has also radically changed, with 95
per cent employed in industry and
commerce.
Often the newly urbanized youth
lose their roots and lead solitary lives.
Many seek new meaning in political
and religious ideologies (the Increased
interest in religion has been wide¬
spread; one Buddhist sect, the Soka-
gakki, has attracted a tenth of all
Japanese to its faith). But the "fin de
siècle" mood said to prevail in Eur¬
ope, is not yet noticeable among
Japanese youth today.
Parents are not shocked or fright¬
ened by the younger generations.
Nihilism, hallucinating stimulants, free
sex, and the cult of violence have not
taken root in the thinking and behav¬
iour of Japanese youth. In the United
States young people may shout
"Make love, not war". In Japan, they
simply shout "Don't make war". The
"make love" is not voiced so openly.
People faced with the uncertainties of
life have built up abiding moral princ¬
iples, and this may become a strong
point for the Japan of the future.
The war dealt a devastating blow
to Japan both physically and mentally.
But now it has recovered to a remark¬
able degree. For the generation which
stood stupefied amidst the rubble
at the end of the war, the vigorous,
youthful pace of present-day Japan
seems like a dream. The mood of
pessimism that many thought would
last forever has vanished completely.
Nobody is bored. And nobody is des¬
pondent or aimless.
One need only look at the throngs
of well dressed young people going
to their offices and factories early in
the morning to realize that Japan is a
lively nation with no axe to grind.
This liveliness is free and spontan¬
eous. When one thinks of the fate
that has befallen some nations it is
perhaps better for Japan to have no
axe to grind. For out of this freedom
something unknown and very valuable
may indeed be born.
The youthful vigour of Japan has,
in a sense, served to restore
national pride, and through her young
people, whose vision has been broad¬
ened in the last two decades, Japan
Is bound to make a growing contribu¬
tion to the world in the years ahead.
In Japan, as in other countries, student
agitation seeks to speed reforms in
universities that have been overwhelmed by
the population explosion and the
rapid expansion of modern knowledge.
Another cause of unrest is the anxiety
felt by young people over current
national and international problems.

HOW JAPAN
STREAMLINED ITS
WRITTEN LANGUAGE
N
O less than 50,000 charac¬
ters were devised by ancient China.
The Japanese, who adopted the Chin¬
ese script many centuries ago, still
employ the same number of Chinese
characters, although the number in
everyday use has been drastically
reduced In the process of moderniz¬
ation. Along with the Chinese charac¬
ters, the Japanese also use about
50 Japanese "kana" letters in their
books, magazines and newspapers
instead of the alphabets printed in
European publications.
Chinese characters were invented
four thousand years ago and the Chin¬
ese are known to have invented both
printing and the use of movable type.
The first imported books written in
Chinese characters were presented to
Japan by the great teacher Wani of
Korea in 285 A.D. The names of the
books were "Analects of Confucius,"
and "The Thousand Characters
Classic."
The "Analects of Confucius" con¬
tains 2,200 Chinese characters. So
the learned class of Japan at that time
used that many Chinese ideographs
a new experience for the Japanese who
did not possess letters of their own
to express their spoken language.
Chinese ideographs seerrv complex
and even grotesque at first sight, but
they are meaningful and even beautiful
at second sight. Although they under¬
went much change during the early
stages, many Chinese characters in
use today are hardly different from
the forms used some 2,000 years ago.
SHIN-ICHI HASEGAWA has been managing
editor of the Japanese language edition of the
"Unesco Courier" since the edition was
launched m 1961. A distinguished journalist
and an authority on problems of mass com¬
munication, Mr. Hasegawa has been for
26 years with the "Japan Times", the English-
language daily published in Tokyo, as editor
and director, and is now editorial adviser
to the paper. Mr. Hasegawa's invaluable
collaboration in the production of the "Unesco
Courier" will come to an end after the
present issue appears. He will then devote
all his time to the activities of the Japanese
National Commission for Unesco, of which
he has been a member since 1965, and to
his work as lecturer in mass communica¬
tion at the universities of Keio and Waseda.
by Shin-lchi Hasegawa
It is said that eighty per cent of the
Chinese characters have been created
through constructing new characters
by combining a pronunciation symbol
or other indicator on one side and the
meaning on the other side of the
ideograph. New characters were
constantly made afresh as men found
it necessary to express what new
thing they saw or thought. Some are
not in daily use today, but the great
mass of characters which had been
invented up to the 18th century are
recorded in the dictionary.
The Kiang Hsi dictionary, which was
published in China in 1716, during the
early years of the Ching dynasty, con¬
tains 47,000 Chinese characters. "The
Great Dictionary", which was edited
by Japanese scholars and is in daily
use in Japan now contains 14,924
Chinese characters. Each character
is numbered, so one can count them
exactly. This dictionary was first
printed in Japan in 1917 and has been
reprinted more than 2,400 times.
If the great prehistoric monsters had
survived to the present age, it would
be considered a miracle. No less a
miracle is the fact that the Japanese
use so many characters in their reading
and writing today, just as the Chinese
and Koreans did centuries ago.
Newspapers using Chinese charac¬
ters are printed in Japan, China, Korea,
Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, and
in the places where their nationals live,
for instance in the Philippines and
the U.S.A. In Viet Nam, Chinese
characters were changed to Roman
spelling eighty years ago during the
French rule, except for sacred Bud¬
dhist texts, still studied in characters.
To use so many ideographs for daily
life may seem a severe burden viewed
from the point of education. It may
also seem inconvenient at least
people who are accustomed to use
phonetic letters often think so. But
one should think it over again.
The literacy rate of Japan is 99 per
cent today. The daily circulation of
newspapers in Japan is 32,447,141
copies published by 121 newspaper
publishing companies according to a
survey in October, 1967 or one news¬
paper per 3.12 persons and 1.23 copies
per family. Japan is considered to be
one of the top three newspaper-
producing countries of the world. The
first daily newspaper in Japan was
"The Yokohama Mainichi Shimbun"
which was published in 1870.
The oldest publication that has
survived in Japan is the handprinted
book of a Buddhist Scripture published
in 770 A.D. This is said to be the
oldest extant handwritten publication
in the world. Since then the art of
book printing has gradually developed,
but for the most part, the method of
wood-block printing or lithography has
been used.
I T was in 1869, the year af¬
ter the Meiji Restoration, that metal
type, such as the Chinese had used
500 years before, and Gutenberg a
century later, was manufactured in
Japan. In 1870 a printing press was
brought to Japan from Shanghai. Since
then the printing industry has remark¬
ably developed.
The number of books published in
1967 amounted to 37,904 titles. The
estimated number of copies of books
published was 487,860,000 and the
value of sales was $614,362,500.
Top sales were in literature; social
science came second and engineering
third, with books for juveniles and
school reference texts coming next.
In the course of a century Japan has
become Asia's leading book publisher,
despite the heavy burden of using so
many ideographic characters.
Although China and Japan use the
same ideographs, there are some
fundamental differences between the
two. In a word, Japan has "Japanized"
the Chinese practice in the use of
ideographs.
Before the eighth century the
Japanese found the way to use Chi¬
nese characters as means to express
Japanese ideas. This invention was
called "Manyo-kana" and the most
important work written in this way is __
the "Manyoshu" a collection of Japa- KU
nese poems edited in the eighth cen- Uw
tury and containing about 4,500 poems
composed during the preceding

STREAMLINING A WRITTEN LANGAGE (Continued)
Hira-gana, the writing adopted by women
four and a half centuries. These
poems were expressed in Chinese
characters, to each of which a
Japanese pronunciation, and not the
present pronunciation of Chinese,
was assigned.
Later in the tenth century two kinds
of "kana" were invented one is "Hira-
gana" and the other "Kata-kana."
These were a Japanese innovation.
The "Hira-gana" was made by simplify¬
ing "Sosho" or quickly handwritten
Chinese characters, while "Kata-kana"
was made by using a part of the print¬
ed form of Chinese characters. They
are not themselves ideographs, but
rather phonetic syllables. "Hira-gana"
was mainly used by women. At first
it was called "women's writing."
In the "Heian" period when the
Imperial Court of Japan was so peace¬
fully prosperous, the position of court
ladies had been elevated. Chinese
ideographic characters were learned
by upper class men, while women
used "Hira-gana" in their writing.
Many novels or stories were written
by court ladies, the representative liter¬
ary masterpiece being Lady Murasa-
ki's "Tale of Genji" written early in
the eleventh century.
"Kata-kana" the other type of
Japanese syllabary was at first used
as phonetic symbols to help students
to read Chinese classics in the
Japanese way. "Hira-gana" is most
popularly used. After the Meiji era
"Kata-kana" was given a new and
important function to write words of
foreign origin in a Japanese way.
The number of forms in each of these
purely Japanese systems of phonetic
writing is about 50 they outnumber
the 26-letter alphabet, but they have
70
the advantage of connecting a vowel
to a consonant to form one sound.
This peculiarity of Japanese "Kana,"
combined with imported Chinese ideo¬
graphic characters, has enabled the
Japanese freely to express their desires
and thoughts in literature and in
daily life. This combination of ancient
Chinese civilization and Japanese-
invented "Kana" letters may be con¬
sidered the meeting and mutual under¬
standing of the Chinese continental
civilization and the Island civilization
of Japan.
Japan has created its own civilization
in the world of letters, entirely different
from the Chinese civilization. This is
the way the Japanese act when
confronted with foreign cultures. Some
of the early novels authored by
court ladies were written solely in
"Hira-gana," excluding all Chinese
characters, and they are valued highly
as literary masterpieces as well. Some
male authors subsequently imitated
the literary works of ladies, as for
example the "Tosa Diary" of Kino
Tsurayuki in the Heian Period (10th
century).
The challenge of European civil¬
ization arrived at the shores of Japan
in the person of an Italian Jesuit
missionary accompanying a delegation
of three Catholic youths sent by the
Christian feudal lords in Kyushu to
the Pope. The missionary brought a
press, European metal type and
several printers with him. This
was 1590.
More than twenty books were
printed in Latin, Portuguese, and
Roman-spelt Japanese in Amakusa,
Nagasaki, and Kyoto, in the late
sixteenth century. Some of the

calligraphy was
introduced into Japan
together with
Chinese characters,
and since then the
Japanese have
developed many new
styles of their own.

printed books are preserved as national
treasures. They include not only
Catholic texts, but "Aesop's Fables"
and the "Heike-monogatari" a romance
of the Heike, the feudal clan which
ruled in the late Heian Period.
This influence of Catholic mission¬
aries was strong, although it was
short-lived, because, for political rea¬
sons, Japan completely closed its
doors to the coming of foreigners after
1639, except for the Dutch and the
Chinese. For more than two hundred
years Japan enjoyed peace, separating
itself from the outer world. During
those years Japan could develop its
own civilization in business, politics,
and culture.
Three examples of
writing systems
used in Japan.
They show the
phrase "Nihongo"
(Japanese
language) as it
appears in
(1) Kanji;
(2) Hira-gana;
(3) Kata-kana.
Peace is the basis of culture this
was proved by the Japanese civili¬
zation. Then came the open-door
policy of the government under
Emperor Meiji. This was the third
response of the Japanese people to
the challenge of foreign civilization
which attacked this small Island
monarchy as part of the Imperialist
drive of the 19th century.
The invention of Chinese ideographs
was necessary in China, where the
strong central government was obliged
to make announcements, not by mouth,
but by letters, in such wide areas
inhabited by so big a population.
Ancient Greece was a small area and
was divided into several independent
city-states. So in the case of the
Greek people their spoken language
was endowed with the spirit of
democracy. But in China the situation
was different. Japan inherited the
literary Chinese civilization.
However, Japan is a small country
when compared with China, and it has
a dense population. Illiteracy can be
removed when government and people
unite in the efforts of advancing
education in this small country, and
Japan already had a comparatively
high standard of education when it
was opened to the world.
The significance of the Meiji
Restoration in 1868 is the change of
cultural values from Oriental to
European ones.
With regard to language policy for
the new Japan, there were four possible
courses of action. First, and the most

radical, would be to suspend the use
of Chinese ideographs and to adopt
the Latin alphabet. The second way
was to write the Japanese language
wholly in "Kana." The third way was
to continue the use of a combination
of Chinese ideographic letters and
"Kana," just as Japan had done for
more than a thousand years. The
fourth way was to limit the number of
Chinese ideographs used in everyday
writing. This way had another aim,
that is, to decrease the number of
Chinese characters to be learned dur¬
ing compulsory education and thereby
lighten for primary school children the
burden of learning so many characters.
Each of these outlets from the
burden of past civilization has been
tried by. the Japanese since the Meiji
Restoration.
First, from the point of view of
education. Although the Tokugawa
feudal government officially closed
the door to the outer world, little by
little world changes were communicated
to Japan through imported foreign
books in Dutch and by Dutch traders.
Hakuseki Arai (1657-1725), a scholar
and statesman of the early Tokugawa
age, learned the Roman alphabet used
in European countries. He wrote in
his book: "The Europeans use an
alphabet, consisting of a little more
than twenty letters. We Japanese use
more than ten thousand characters.
Unless one has a strong memory, one
cannot remember so many. This
means loss of our energy." He was
the first reformer of the way of writing
by the use of Chinese characters
which the Japanese had been
using for more than ten centuries.
Two years before the Meiji
Restoration, Hisoka Maejima, another
scholar and statesman, gave his
opinion to the Shogunate that Japan
should abolish the use of all the
Chinese characters and use only
"Hira-gana." After the Restoration,
Maejima became the publisher of a
daily newspaper printed only in "Kana."
The title of the paper was "Kana-
gawa Kana Shimbun." But it lasted
only one year. Maejima started
another daily newspaper entitled the
"Yubin Hochi Shimbun." This paper
survived until scores of years later.
A suggestion to have the entire
Japanese language spelt in the Roman
alphabet was presented by Yoshikazu
Nambu to high government officials in
charge of education in 1869.
These two attempts to reform the
written language by abolishing the use
of Chinese characters were followed
by others in later years.
But a more practical suggestion
came from Yukichi Fukuzawa, a great
leader of the new culture in Japan (see
page 12), who wrote in 1872 in his
book entitled "Moji no Oshie," or
"Teaching of Letters," that for ordinary
people the number of Chinese ideo¬
graphic characters would be enough if
they learned from 2,000 to 3,000 ideo¬
graphs, and used the phonetic "Kana"
syllables to replace the rest. "I use in

this book" he wrote, "less than
1,000 Chinese ideographs. I do not
think that with the use of so few
characters, the readers cannot grasp
the whole meaning of this book." He
was a forerunner of the new trend.
The number of Chinese characters
in use was officially reduced after
World War II. In 1923 a temporary
Japanese Language Research Commit¬
tee recommended a standard list of
1,960 Chinese characters to be used
for daily life. This recommendation
was supported by twenty newspapers.
In 1946, the same year when the new
Japanese Democratic Constitution was
promulgated, the Japanese Government
reduced the standard list to 1,850
Chinese characters for daily use.
This was welcomed by most of the
people in those days, but as years
passed, criticism of this limit was
made. The critics said that boys and
girl should know more Chinese char¬
acters so that they could read their
own classics.
It has also been pointed out that
the decision regarding any consider¬
ation of a reduction in the number of
ideographic characters to be used
daily in writing should rest not with
the government but with the people.
The tide of history would then decide
how many ideographs should be used.
For a while after the war there was
another trend toward the limitation
of the use of Chinese characters
and eventually toward the complete
abolition of their use. The adoption
of either "Kana" or the Roman alpha¬
bet to the exclusion of all Chinese
characters was strongly advocated by
some. However, this tendency has
lost much force in recent years.
The growth of higher education has
tended to increase the number of Chi¬
nese characters used. The learning of
ideographs presents many difficulties,
but it also has many advantages. The
characters may look like letters to the
uninitiated but in reality they are
words. So they can represent many
ideas at a glance to the reader.
The Japanese have invented another
convenient way of writing Japanese in
the system known as "Furigana," by
which small Kana characters are
placed on the right hand side of any
Chinese character to show its pronun¬
ciation and meaning. This way enabl¬
ed less literate people to read difficult
Chinese characters.
Combination of two parts making
one word in Chinese ideographs is

### 59225: How Japan streamlined its written language

STREAMLINING A WRITTEN LANGUAGE (Continued)
The pros
and cons
of two-way
writing
While a typewriter for European
languages uses about 84 symbols,
a Japanese typewriter uses 3,130 or
more, packed tightly into a large box.
Below, a Japanese typist moves a lever
over the box until it is directly above
the desired character. The characters
can be typed on the paper vertically
or horizontally as desired (above).
convenient in this age of electronic
computers. For example, almost all
"fish" names have the same "sign"
at the left side of the ideograph. The
sign for a particular "fish" tuna, carp,
trout, or any other fish is expressed
on the right side. It is quite easy to
find the appropriate word in an elec¬
tronic computer with the help of this
classification of Chinese characters.
Another merit (or demerit) of the
present Japanese language is that it
can be written both vertically and
horizontally.
When you read Japanese news¬
papers the headlines are printed in
both ways vertically and horizontally.
Signboards on the streets are also
written in either way. When you stand
at the crossroads of the busiest
shopping centre of Tokyo, the Ginza,
you see skysign news coming up from
the bottom so that you can read the
news from top to bottom, according
to the usual way of reading Japan¬
ese. Near the boulevard other sign¬
boards are written horizontally from
left to right, and sometimes, although
it has become rare these days, the
letters on the signboard are written
horizontally from right to left, following
the old-fashioned way of writing.
During the Meiji era all Japanese
letters were written vertically. With
the use of foreign languages which
are read horizontally, a new trend has
risen in Japan (as in China too),
to write the Japanese language hori¬
zontally, especially among university
students and in scientific circles.
I N 1952 the Japanese cabi¬
net made an epoch-making pronounce¬
ment that manuscripts prepared by
government officials should henceforth
be written horizontally from left to right
after a short adaptation period. This
put the official seal of approval on the
new custom, except for the Ministry of
Justice, where legal texts are still
written vertically, including the text
of the Japanese Constitution.
Now horizontal writing is over¬
whelmingly popular in writing Japanese,
including text books. Nevertheless,
in the newspapers, main stories are
printed vertically, but quotations of
markets and radio and television
programmes are printed horizontally.
Why is the Japanese usage so free
in this respect? I believe it is because
the Japanese are a practical nation.
The Japanese believe the nature of
water is free. Water changes its shape
according to the shape of the bowl.
When the bowl is round, water takes
the round shape. When the bowl is
square, water is squarely shaped. This
is the teaching of "Zen" Buddhism,
and the philosophy of the Japanese
throughout the centuries.
How to deal mechanically with so
many ideographs has been one of the
problems for those who are concerned
with printing. In 1915, typewriters for
Chinese characters and "Kana" were
invented in Japan and they are now
widely used in business. A Japanese
typewriter uses 3,130 or more.
The Chinese character typewriter
resembles the Western typewriter only
in name. The machine comprises a
large box in which all the metal
characters are tightly packed. The
271 characters most frequently used
are found in the centre with the rarer
characters placed on both sides of
this group with "Kana" and number
markings for easy identification.
Typing is accomplished by moving
an arm over the box until it is directly
over the desired character and then
pressing firmly down. Typing is thus
a slow affair, but a skilful typist can
type 714 Chinese ideographs in ten
minutes.
A
much more useful inven¬
tion of recent years in the field of publi¬
cation is the use of the teletype
setter for the classical Chinese ideo¬
graphs. An electric teletype is. connec¬
ted to a monotype machine. When the
teletype moves, it makes many small
holes on the tape which symbolize the
Chinese characters. An automatic
monotype casting machine produces
the type following the indication of the
small holes. The Asahi newspaper
inaugurated this apparatus in 1955 and
Kyodo News Agency, Japan's largest
news agency for local newspapers,
began this kind of operation in 1960.
In 1959 the Asahi undertook the
communication of whole facsimile
pages of the daily Tokyo Asahi to its
branch papers on Hokkaido, the
industrial northern island of Japan. By
the use of facsimile, identical news
pages are printed by the offset process
from the films supplied by a central
office, thus obviating the need for
setting type again. Now a similar
system is used between Tokyo and
Takaoka by the Yomiuri newspaper,
between Tokyo and Fukuoka by the
Nihon Keizai, and between several
other cities.
The coming of new means of
communication, radio and television,
has freed anew the Japanese people
from the burden of ideographs. Radio
was introduced to Japan in 1925 and
television stations, both public and
private, were started in 1953.
As this kind of new audio-visual
means of mass communication needs
no type and no printing machines, the
trouble of using Chinese ideographs
is avoided. But strangely enough, in
Japan, the publishing world has become
more prosperous in the years since
television was introduced, side by side
with the prosperity of television.
The reason for this is credited to
the expansion of education among the
population, the economic development,
and the increase of leisure among
salaried people and workers. In a
word, successful modernization in
Japan has widened the capacity of the
people to enjoy the country's literary
culture.

to believe that this issue is a major

ation. The rhaterial is written in clear,
understandable and non-jargonish or
technical language but does not
speak down to the reader. I plan to
make reference to this issue in our

readers will be alerted to this excellent

THE NEW FRONTIERS
OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
Sir,
Sean MacBride's article "The New
Frontiers of International Law."
(Jan. 1968) is excellent, except that he
fails to carry his conclusion far
enough. If indeed we wish to imple¬
ment human rights on a global scale,
certainly we need more than merely
the proposed Universal Court of
Human Rights with exhortatory func¬
tions, and more than the present sys¬
tem of unenforceable Human Rights
Covenants. In order to make the
noble ideas embodied in the Coven¬
ants binding, do we not need a sys¬
tem of enforceable world law of which
the Covenants could be a part?
But the use of the adjective "enforce¬
able" in connexion with "world 'law
clearly means world government. And
if such a federal world government is
to be effective, its laws must be
enforceable on individuals; law enforce¬
ment on collective entities such as
nations either results in war (if direct
force is applied) or, if force is not
used, is totally ineffective in the face
of determined resistance (as we have
witnessed in the case of Rhodesia).
To be just and democratic in the pro¬
tection of human rights, the lawmak¬
ing body of such a world government
should be elected directly by the
people of the world on a more equi¬
table basis than the present one
nation-one vote system used in the
United Nations General Assembly.
Is such a world government Uto¬
pian? If so, then the concept of
human rights is doubly so, because
past and present experiences demons¬
trate not only that political unification
¡s a prerequisite to justice, but also
that such unification can be brought
about fairly rapidly, whereas the strug¬
gle for human rights is a never-ending
one. Moreover, the goal of a govern¬
ed world could be achieved by trans¬
forming the present United Nations
Charter into a world constitution.
I have but one question: What are
we waiting for?
J. Chrys Dougherty. IV
St. Stephen's School
Austin, Texas, U.S.A.
Sir,
In "The N»3w Frontiers of Inter¬
national Law", Sean MacBride affirms
the need to punish persons guilty of
crimes against humanity and if ne¬
cessary to brand them as international
outlaws. I personally have doubts
that We shall resolve the problem ¡n
this way. Who, in fact, are the people
who violate human rights? Is it
possible for us to punish governments,
or those who act in their name?
Why not set up a supra-national
court whose jurisdiction would be
automatic, that is, citizens of all
countries accepting its jurisdiction
could make use of the court to appeal
against 'decisions taken against them
by national courts, especially those
dealing with criminal and administra¬
tive affairs.
And once the plaintiff's appeal had
been accepted, the supra-national
court should simply place him under
the legal authority of the United
Nations. In this way, even though he
would be unable to exercise his rights
in his own country, he could at least
live elsewhere as a free person.
I know that this is not the justice
we aspire to, but would it not be a
step in the right direction?
José Sommavielle
Lisbon, Portugal
Sean MacBride replies: "I fully
agree that the establishment of a true
world court, whose jurisdiction would
be recognized internationally and
which would be open to everyone as
a supreme court of appeal, is the only
really effective way of ensuring re¬
spect for human rights. Unfortunately,
as we all know, many countries are
still far from ready to accept this
idea. But in the meantime we should
not overlook even minor steps or
measures that could bring an improve¬
ment, however slight. I am sure that
if a public employee for example, a
prison guard who illtreated prisoners
knew there was a competent author¬
ity to which the facts could be made
known and which could brand him
as a "criminal against humanity",
this alone would have a restraining
influence on him, even though he could
not actually be punished, and would
make others reflect too."
ASTRONOMICAL ANALOGY
I should like to point out an error
in the photo caption on page 15 of
your March 1968 number ("Our Health
Tomorrow"), which states that the
human brain "comprises 10,000 million
cells as many as there are stars in
our galaxy". This is not so. Accord¬
ing to present scientific knowledge,
the number of stars in our galaxy is
at least ten times greater, that is,
100,000 million.
Prof. P.K. Nik. Sauer
Carona Switzerland
The distinguished French physicist,
Pierre Auger, comments: "The number
of cells in the human brain is of the
order of 10 to the 10th power
(10,000 million) or 10 to the 11th
power (100,000) according to whether
one includes the various types of auxi¬
liary cells (neuroglia etc.). For the
stars in our galaxy a factor of uncer¬
tainty also exists. Thus the compa¬
rison is largely symbolical and can
only be accurate to within a factor of
from two to ten. That the orders of
numerical size should be the same
Is in itself quite remarkable."
'SPARE PARTS' SURGERY
Sir,
Experimental organ transplantation,
whose results will be of doubtful
benefit to the sick person of tomorrow
(despite all the current publicity) have
the undoubted disadvantage of divert¬
ing considerable medical resources
which would be better employed in
seeing that the sick of today are cared
for under proper conditions, in well-
equipped hospitals, staffed by adequate
personnel, which is not the case at
present.
As a doctor quoted in your issue
"Our Health Tomorrow" (March 1968)
so rightly observes, there is a great
deal of duplication going on in clinical
investigation. In my view this rivalry
among aspiring "medical stars" who
want to see themselves in the news¬
paper headlines should be stopped.
The very number of experiments
makes it all the more difficult to exer¬
cise proper supervision in making
sure that they are all really useful.

A City
of Cathay
A panoramic view of a Chinese city of cen¬
turies ago unfolds on the five postage stamps
shown above, recently issued by the Directorate
of Posts of the Republic of China. This "art
gallery" in miniature presents scenes from a
famous Chinese handscroll, "A City of Cathay,"
executed by Chang Tse-tuan. Depicted in the
painting are people of every trade and profession
in a variety of costumes, shops, city walls anu'
gates, streets and lanes, bridges and boats, the
whole forming a pictorial sociological record of
the time, with every detail captured by the artist's
brush. Many copies were made of "A City of
Cathay": designs for the stamps five one-
dollar NT (New Taiwan) issues and two larger
format, five and eight-dollar NT denominations
are based on a copy painted jointly by five court
artists of the Emporor Chien Lung in 1736.

iI^^l^K^] sed newly-married couples on their
honeymoon is becoming a common sight in modern Japan. This new feature
of post-wedding rites is by no means a luxury, since a helicopter trip from
Tokyo to a traditional honeymoon resort costs as little as 4,000 yen ($11).
