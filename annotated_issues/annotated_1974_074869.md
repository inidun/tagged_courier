This late 15th century
wood statuette (55 cm.
high) from the collec¬
tion of the Musées
R oya ux d'Art et
d'Histoire in Brussels
(Belgium) is an ac¬
complished example
of Flemish carving of
the early Renaissance
period. The work was
sculpted by Jan Borman
who lived and worked
in Brussels in the 15th
and 16th centuries. It
depicts a serene and
graceful Mary Magda¬
lene, the young woman
of Magdala, in Galilee,
who became a faithful
follower of Jesus.
Flemish sculptors of
the early Renaissance
achieved an expressive
synthesis of realism and
rhythmic grace.

This one-legged skier, here competing
in an exacting slalom contest in France,
demonstrates what persons described
as "handicapped" can do not only in
spoit but in all walks of life when
encouraged and given half an oppor¬
tunity. "It is not what you have lost
but what you have left that counts",
says Sir Ludwig Guttmann, founder of
the international Olympics of the Para¬
lyzed (see article page 4).

Twenty - five
years ago a
doctor dreamed
a dream. And,
In this dream, he
saw thousands
of severely para¬
lyzed people
united in an
Olympics of the Paralyzed, the like of
which could hardly be believed in a
world which at the time wrote off these
unhappy victims of Injury and disease
as incurable cripples and outcasts.
Today this Is no longer a dream
but a reality, and those same paralyzed
men, women and children have ins¬
pired other disabled amputees, blind,
cerebral palsy cases to become
sportsmen and sportswomen in their
own right.
The doctor whose ideas launched
this world-wide movement of sports
for the disabled is Sir Ludwig Gutt-
mann. During the Second World War,
he first introduced sport at the Spinal
Injuries Centre, Stoke Mandeville Hos¬
pital, In England, as part of the medical
treatment of men and women with
injuries of the spinal cord who were
paralyzed from the waist or chest
downwards. His reasons were two¬
fold: first to train the body, and second,
to prevent the boredom of hospital life.
Sport is of much greater significance
for the severely disabled than for the
able-bodied person. Serious physical
handicap Interferes to a greater or
lesser degree with bodily function and
co-ordination and leads to abnormal
patterns of movement. These often
induce psychological tensions that
make social contact with the outside
world difficult or even Impossible.
If the paralyzed person is continually
stared at, he may develop an inferior¬
ity complex characterized by anxiety
with loss of self-confidence and per¬
sonal dignity; the result is self-pity,
self-centred isolation, and anti-social
attitudes. Taking an active part in
sporting activities restores his psycho¬
logical equilibrium and enables him to
face up to life In spite of his physical
disability.
The final, and possibly the noblest,
aim of sport for the disabled person
is to help him regain his contact with
the world around him. Sport develops
mental attitudes that are essential for
successful social re-integration and,
in particular, .for useful employment.
These were the reasons which led to

Sir Ludwig Guttmann,
founder of the Olympics of
the Paralyzed.
the founding of the Stoke Mandeville
Games by Sir Ludwig in July 1948,
when a small party of 16 paralyzed
ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen
took part in archery competitions. In
the ensuing years the Games grew
and the number of events were In¬
creased to include, as well as archery,
bowls, basketball, field events, fencing,
track events, snooker, swimming, table
tennis and weight lifting.
Today these Games are an Interna¬
tional Sports Festival (the Olympics of
the Paralyzed) which are held annually
for three successive years at Stoke
Mandeville Sports Stadium and every
fourth year In close connexion with
the Olympic Games.
It was this outstanding sportsman¬
ship that prompted the International
Olympic Committee, during the Olym
pic Games in Melbourne in 1956, to
award the Fearnley Cup to the organ¬
ization of the Stoke Mandeville Games.
This is an Olympic Award which any
sports organization can win for out¬
standing achievements In the ¡deals
of the Olympic movement.
In 1960 the Games were held in
Rome, in 1964 In Tokyo, in 1968 in
Israel (as Mexico was not able to
accommodate them as well as the
Olympics) and In 1972 in Heidelberg.
In Heidelberg, as in Munich, these
Games were opened by the President
of the Federal Republic of Germany,
Dr. Gustav Heinemann, who, at the
same time, bestowed on Sir Ludwig
Guttmann, the founder of the Games,
the Golden Star of the Grand Cross
of the Order of Merit of the Federal
Republic.
Who would have thought when the
Stoke Mandeville Games started in
1948 that one day paraplegics and
even tetrapleglcs from all parts of the
world would fly as sportsmen and
sportswomen in their own right, just
as do the able-bodied, ten thousand
miles and more to represent their
countries in international sports fes¬
tivals?
The whole concept of the Games is
embodied In a message written by Sir
Ludwig in 1956: "The aim of the Stoke
Mandeville Games is to unite paralyzed
men and women from all parts of the
world In an international sports move¬
ment, and your spirit of true sportsman¬
ship today will give hope and inspira¬
tion to thousands of paralyzed people."
In 1960, this dynamic man founded
the British Sports Association for the

WHO WOULD
HAVE THOUGHT?
Who would have thought that,
as a result of the Olympics of
the Paralyzed, held in Tokyo
in 1964, and after seeing the
performance of the handicapped
in sports, the Japanese Govern¬
ment would set up within six
months a factory specially desi¬
gned for employing paraple¬
gics? By 1968 Japan had
opened three such factories for
the disabled. This fact alone
proves the immense effect which
sport for the disabled has on
society as a whole to give their
paralyzed fellow-men a fair
chance for their integration
into society.

OLYMPICS FOR THE PARALYZED
(Continued)
Disabled, which is an umbrella orga¬
nization for all types of disabled
amputees, blind, cerebral palsy cases
and paraplegics.
Towards the end of 1967 his dream
of building a huge sports complex
for all disabled began to take form,
and in July 1969 the Stoke Mandeville
Sports Stadium for the Paralyzed and
other Disabled was opened by Queen
Elizabeth.
Four major Games are held at Stoke
Mandeville annually: The Multi-disabled
Children's Games, the National Stoke
Mandeville Games, the International
Stoke Mandeville Games and the Adult
Multi-disabled Games. The stadium Is
also used by disabled sports clubs for
week-end training, and by mentally and
physically handicapped people during
the week.
It is due to the loyalty and devotion
which Sir Ludwig inspires that this
stadium was built by voluntary contri¬
butions (with a small government grant)
from young schoolchildren and old age
pensioners and people from all walks
of life and the disabled themselves.
This brain child of Sir Ludwig's is
a monument to the devoted work he
has done throughout the years for
disabled persons all over the world so
that, through the medium of sport, they
may be reintegrated into the com¬
munity as equal and respected
citizens.

run by the French National Ski Federation. The skiers negotiate
even difficult slopes with ease thanks to a code language based
on the position of the hands on a clock called out to them by
sighted guides. "Eleven o'clock" means turn a bit to the left;
"one o'clock" turn a bit to the right. "Three o'clock" 45 degrees

### 50228: How I perceive the world around me: the extraordinary story of a woman writer, blind and deaf from the age of five

HOW I PERCEIVE
THE WORLD
AROUND ME
In 1972 a book entitled
"How I Perceive, Imagine and Understand the World
Around Me" was published in Moscow. Its author, a
poet and essayist named Olga Skorokhodova, is both
blind and deaf. Hers is an extraordinary life story
and a no less astounding achievement. She was born
in 1914 in a village of Southern Ukraine. Before the
age of five she contracted meningitis and completely
lost first her sight and then her hearing, so that her
speech became impaired. At that time she lost both
her parents.
Aï the Odessa School
for the Blind, where she was sent in 1922, the teachers
could do nothing to bring her out of her isolation.
In 1925 she entered the clinic for deaf, dumb and
blind children set up in Kharkov two years earlier
by Professor Ivan Sokolyansky. There her speech
was restored. With the help of special methods
devised by Professor Sokolyansky and with Braille,
she was taught regular school subjects and completed
her secondary education. She is now a member of
the Institute for the Handicapped of the U.S.S.R.
Academy of Educational Sciences in Moscow and
holds a Master's degree in educational psychology.
She also teaches at a special deaf-blind school at
Zagorsk, near Moscow whose pioneering work for
the handicapped has won it a worldwide reputation.
WlTH her latest book,
Olga Skorokhodova completes a trilogy describing
how a person deprived of the most important senses
sight and hearing perceives, imagines and com¬
prehends the world around. On the following pages
we present salient passages from this moving and
inspiring work.

T is not difficult to per¬
ceive, to "look at" an object with
the hands; it is much more difficult
to describe in words exactly how
I perceive that object, to convey my
mental ¡mage of it. When deaf, dumb
and blind people describe their sens¬
ations, perceptions, and ideas in the
language of those who can see,
although they use the same words,
they feel with different sense organs.
When someone with normal sight
sees a cow in the distance, he may
say: "I'm looking at the cow; it is
brown with white spots; it has big,
beautiful eyes", etc.
A blind person, describing his own
Immediate sensations and perceptions,
would say something like this: "I can
feel the cow with my hands, it has
a smooth, soft coat. I have felt its
legs and its head- On its head I
found horns which seem to me
to be very hard."
How could a deaf person describe
someone playing a piano? The only
thing he could say would be something
like the following: "I put my hands on
the top of the piano and I could feel
the vibration of what those who can
hear call sounds."
I have experienced many things, and
the more contact I have had with peo¬
ple and the better I have got to know
life and nature, the richer and more
complex my- perceptions and Ideas
about the external world have become.
Consequently, it has become all the
harder for me to find the necessary
words for each separate fact of my
experience.
Year by year I have extended my
knowledge and enriched my literary
vocabulary. The reader may or may
not believe me that is up to him
when I say that I am Indebted for my
knowledge and for my literary language
to reading, more reading, and yet more
reading, particularly of works of liter¬
ature.
Reading can be the salvation of the
blind, the deaf and the dumb, and
especially of those who combine all
three handicaps. When those who are
responsible for the education and up¬
bringing of the severely handicapped
realize this, much greater progress will
be made in that education than is now
the case.
'Seeing' with my hands
My hands partly replace sight and
hearing, but my feet also come in use¬
ful. When I am walking in the street
or in a park, I can easily feel the
slightest slope in the ground and for
this reason I know when I am coming
to the edge of the pavement, where
I have to step down onto the roadway

and when I get to the other side where
I have to step up onto the pavement
again. Even indoors I can feel when
the floor slopes slightly In any
direction...
When L.I. shakes hands with me I
always know how she is feeling. I
always notice, for instance, if she is
upset about anything. I can feel this
by the movement of her fingers, by the
tension in her hand and by a slight
trembling.
If I ask her what Is wrong, she often
replies that nothing is wrong at all, but
I know her hand and her movements so
well that I don't believe her. I don't
think that if I could see and study
her face I would be any better able to
judge her physical state and her mood
from the expression of her face than
from the subtle signs which are com¬
municated to me by touch...
One day I remarked to Maria that
her dress, which had been very short,
had been lengthened. I felt to see how
the dressmaker had done it and I
noticed that the tacking had been left
in. I called A.I. and asked her: "Why
didn't they take the tacking out? It's
hardly noticeable, but it should have
been taken out..."
I was once reading with C, when
she was called away for a few minutes
and I was left by myself. Next to me
on the table was a heap of books.
They were not books for the blind and
I had no means of knowing what they
were, but on the cover of one of them
I felt a circle, in the middle of which
was a portrait in relief.
I ran my fingers over it and I Iden¬
tified the face, and also easily located
the eyes, nose, mouth, chin and ear.
When C. came back I asked her:
"What Is this book?" She replied that
it was Lamarck's "Philosophy of Zoo¬
logy". I asked if the head on the cover
was a portrait of Lamarck, and she
replied that it was...
It is very difficult for people with
normal hearing to appreciate what ¡s
meant by reading something "express¬
ively" with the fingers. I have often
explained this to people who have been
reading to me and demonstrated what
I mean with my fingers, but It is difficult
for those who can see to grasp,
although I and the children we teach
can feel this very clearly.
B., for Instance, when she Is talking
about things or people she likes, uses
a gentle, as it were caressing move¬
ment of the fingers; if she does not like
something or if she Is displeased with
somebody, she makes rapid, abrupt
movements of the fingers, although she
has never been taught to do so. What
I call "expressive hands" are hands
in which I can feel to use the lan¬
guage of those who can see and hear,
a "lively, mobile face" or "an intona¬
tion of voice".
Most blind people are completely
reliant on those who can see when

they want to thread a needle. The
few blind people who can thread a
needle for themselves usually do so
by placing the eye of the needle
against the tip of their tongue, so
that when the end of the thread passes
through they can feel it with their
tongue.
My method is different: I take the
needle between the thumb and middle
finger of the left hand, holding it near
to the eye, and the thread between
the thumb and Index finger of my right
hand; I can then easily thread it
straight away, as long as the needle is
a good straight one and does not slip
about in my fingers.
In fact, not only am I Independent in
this respect of the help of colleagues
who can see, but I am often able to
help them when the light is poor. A.I.
has often asked me to help her in this
way, and when I have asked her why
she could not do It herself, she has
explained that it was dark and that
she could not see to thread the needle
because it was a small one. For some
reason, I find it easier to thread a fine
needle than a larger one...
Once when T.A. was reading to me,
K. came in and began talking to her.
I put my hands on the two speakers'
throats and "listened" to their voices,
then I "looked at" their faces. "Are
we beautiful?" asked T.A., jokingly.
"Well, your face is better than K's", I
replied. "No she has a fresher com¬
plexion than I", said T.A. "That may
be", I replied, "but you have finer
features than her."
Later, in conversation with L.I., I
told her about this incident and asked
her whether my judgement had been
right, and she confirmed that it had.
The sense of smell
Sometime last year, I was reading
the papers with U. When we had
read all that were available, U. went
off to see H. to get some more, but
when she brought the new papers and
gave me one I told her I had already
read It. When she asked me how I
knew, even before she had read It out
to me, I replied that I recognized its
smell and knew that I had read that
particular newspaper with R.G. She
then said that was quite impossible
since H. would not have given her the
HOW I PERCEIVE THE WORLD (Continued)
paper if I had already read it. So
I asked her to read out a headline
from the paper, and I was able to
convince her that I had indeed read
the paper before with R.G.
Although I can neither see nor hear,
I am still very fond of nature. I can
smell all the different perfumes, I can
touch the petals of a flower, Individual
blades of grass, twigs and leaves- I
can feel the baking heat of the sun,
and I know how pleasantly refreshing
shade and cold water are to the body
after the heat.
I love the seaside, and I have always
been able to tell by the smell when
we were getting near to the sea. Al¬
though I cannot see it or hear the
murmur of its waves, it is a great
pleasure to me to be near the sea and
to breathe the bracing air. When I have
been by the sea, I have experienced
a feeling of reverence and awe at Its
might and beauty, of which I have
formed a mental picture...
One day when E.A. came to see
me, I could detect there was an odour
of rubber. I asked her why there was
this smell, and she replied that she
had been working with some children
on the word "ball" and had been
holding a rubber ball in her hands.
'Hearing' by vibrations
I can detect and distinguish the
various sorts of noise made by furni¬
ture being moved, just as easily as I
can smell. I can pick up these move¬
ments by the vibrations of the floor.
In the dining-room where I was
working one day with G. there are
two big wooden calendars which can
be turned In any direction, especially
made for our children. When the
calendars are turned they make a tapp¬
ing noise. Sensing the noise, which
was annoying me and stopping me
from concentrating, I did not imme¬
diately realize that it came from one of
the calendars and I asked G. who was
tapping. She replied that she could
not hear anything-
This reply greatly surprised me. I
was sure that if I could feel the noise
through the vibration of the floor, then
she should be able to hear it before I
felt it. But the tapping noise continued
and I could not concentrate on what
G. was reading out to me.
I waited a while, until the tapping
was repeated several times, then asked
her again If she heard anything. This
time she replied that she could hear
the noise and that it was the tapping
of the calendar. She said that the
noise had not disturbed her and she
paid no attention to it.
It occurred to me then that people
who can see and hear are so used to
various noises that they are quite con
vinced they are not hearing or seeing
anything at all...
When I enter an unfamiliar building,
I immediately know what sort of floor
or staircase it has. For instance, if
there Is a wooden staircase, I can feel
a sort of long vibration from my own
footsteps, but if it is a concrete stair¬
case, the sensation is of a shorter
vibration...
I have several times taken a boat
trip down the Dnieper. As these trips
took place In the summer-time, I stayed
the whole time on deck. I could feel
the movement of the boat very clearly,
and could feel the engines working
away like the beating of a great heart
somewhere below the decks...
I would think very few people who
have all their faculties would believe
that someone who Is blind and deaf
can "listen" to singing and music In
fact, a blind and deaf person can have
a very clear sensation of the sound
of a voice and of instrumental music,
and can derive great pleasure from
them.
The difference is, of course, that he
"listens" not with his ears, but with
his hands. I am very fond of putting
my hands on a piano or some other
musical Instrument when It is being
played. I also like to place my hand
on the throat of a person who is sing¬
ing or speaking.
L.I. and C. were once talking in my
presence. I had heard L.l.'s voice
many times before and was very fond
of it. I had never heard C.'s voice
before and was therefore interested by
It. I placed my hand on L.l.'s throat
and then on C.'s. I could feel C.'s
voice was somewhat lower than LI. 's
and at the same time I could tell that
C.'s voice had a pleasant timbre. I
asked L.I. if in fact C.'s voice was
lower than hers and she replied that
in her opinion it was not lower but C.
was simply talking louder than usual.

sion that C.'s voice was lower and I

decided to ask my friend N., who has
a good musical ear. The next day I
introduced N. to C. and asked her to
pay attention to the voice. After talk¬
ing to C. for a while, N. told me that
her voice was indeed somewhat lower
than L.l.'s but that It had a com¬
pletely different timbre. It was there¬
fore not Immediately obvious whose
voice was the lower...
As I can feel other people's voices
by putting my hand on their throats,
I often feel my own throat when I am
speaking. I do this so that I can to
some extent correct my voice and con¬
trol Its pitch, volume and tone.
This may seem strange or even ridi¬
culous to some, but in fact I cari feel
my own voice with my hand almost
as well as I could hear It with my own
ears. I think It would be a good
thing for all deaf and dumb people to
get into the habit of holding their
throats while speaking. It would help
them to speak In a much more pleasant
way and much more clearly. When I
am talking to someone new, I often
use this method of controllng my
voice...
If I am near a piano, I can feel
the sounds very well even when I have
not got my hands on the top of the
Instrument. This is not as strange as
it may seem: the sound vibrations are
transmitted through the instrument and
across the floor, and I can feel them
through my feet, especially loud
chords.
Once when I was at my friend N.'s
house, I was lying on a settee while
she played the piano, which stood
next to it. At some point I began to
doze, but was suddenly awakened by
strong sound vibrations. N. was play¬
ing a piece in which there were a
number of powerful chords and, lying
on the settee, I had the impression that
there was some piano-like musical ins¬
trument in the settee itself, so strongly
were the sound vibrations transmitted...
I had a friend who played the clarinet
in an orchestra, and on one occasion I
sat next to him while he was playing.
I do not remember what the music was,
but I remember that my friend held my
hand and I beat time to the music.
When the music was finished, I asked
if I had been keeping time correctly
and he replied that I had...
It would be a mistake to think that
deaf people cannot distinguish one per¬
son's walk from another. Some people
have a walk which annoys me. I often
sit reading in the canteen. A.N. often
walks through the canteen, and his
walk greatly annoys me. I don't know
what sort of noise he makes when he
walks, but to me, sensing the noise
by other means, it seems as if A.N.
is walking on four legs rather than two,
and making more noise with two of his
feet than with the other two. Apparent¬
ly this is because he does not tie
up his shoe-laces properly and makes
a scuffling noise with his heels...
I read recently in a magazine for the
blind that a blind schoolboy had sug¬
gested there should be special tea¬
pots for the blind so that they would
not spill the tea when pouring it into a
cup. This would not be a bad idea
but personally I do not feel any need
for a special teapot.
. When I pour hot or cold water
into a cup or glass, I do not hold the
cup in the way most people do but
put my fingers round It In such a way
that I can feel the temperature of the
water and where it comes up to in the
cup. Only very rarely do I let the
water spill over, and that is usually
because I am thinking of something
else and not paying attention to what
I am doing.
My many efforts
to understand
what colours are
Many people have asked me whether
I have any idea of colours. Some
people have even asked me whether
I can feel different colours. My reply
to both these questions is "Of course
not", but as I speak the same language
as people who can see, I talk , about
colours, using the same words as are
normally used.
I would very much like to have a
mental picture of colours and when I
was younger I often tried to get my
friends and relations to explain colours
to me. Once, for instance, I had a
dress made and was told that
it was coffee-coloured. I liked the
cut of the dress very much and was
therefore especially keen to know what
this coffee colour was. My friends
told me: "It is just the same as milky
coffee. Do you understand?"
Of course I had a mental image of
a cup of hot coffee with milk, and I
could even imagine the smell and the
taste of the coffee, but not the colour
instead of the colour I thought of my
dress, which I ran my fingers over
very carefully, although I knew I was
not able to "see" the coffee colour
with my fingers.
On another occasion I asked what
colour my scarf was and was told
that it was sandy coloured. I asked
what a sandy colour was and someone
again replied "Just like sand. Do you
understand?" I had a very clear image
of the sand in our garden where the
children used to play with their buckets
and spades. I had another image of a
river bank where there was lots of
damp, cold sand.
Another ¡mage which came to mind
was that of a beach by the seaside
which I knew well, where the sand was
dry and hot to the feet. But none of
this gave me any idea what a sandy
colour might be. Friends also tried
to explain green to me by comparing
it with grass or the leaves of trees,
and I thought of grass or leaves but of
nothing else...
My idea of a cloud may be of inte¬
rest. I Imagine the warm rays of the
sun after a storm, and somewhere to
the side of the sun, floating in the air
a dark (to use a word that people
who can see use I only imagine it as
dark), rectangular mass, a lump of
some dense substance-
This object moves nearer and nearer
to the sun and finally blots out the
sun's heat. If I am walking along the
street and a cloud covers the sun, I
Immediately feel the difference in the
air temperature, and it is this change
from warmth to coolness which gives
me my idea of a cloud.
I imagine a storm-cloud as a big
circle in the sky (the sky itself a bound¬
less expanse of air), with zigzag lines
of gleaming hot lightning around the
edges. Big chunks of the circle then -
break away and move about in a
disorderly fashion, colliding with each
other and producing thunder. The
colliding fragments then fly apart,
breaking up into minute particles
which fall to earth as cold raindrops...




How I image
the Milky Way
and the Moon
I do not know what the Milky Way
Is really like, but my idea of it is
quite different from what those who
can see must have of it. When I
read about the Milky Way, I imagine
a long, rather narrow piece of the
finest, lightest, softest muslin, some¬
thing like a veil, stretching across the
sky far, far above the earth.
I do not know how beautiful the
Milky Way is, but it seems to me that
if this muslin is light in colour and
the sky beyond is dark blue, then it
must be beautiful. I have heard people
who can see talking about such a
combination of colours. 1Q
When I read In a book about the
Milky Way gleaming, I first imagine
milk, and feel Its taste in my mouth.

HOW I PERCEIVE THE WORLD (Continued)
'/

I know that milk is white so I presume
that the muslin of the Milky Way must
also be white or very nearly white.
Thus I repeat that I am constantly
obliged to use the language of people
who can see and hear, for there is no
separate language for the blind and
the deaf-
People often talk about the moon
and I have read about it in many books.
In old books, the moon is described as
a lamp hanging in the sky at night,
and this is the image which some
people who can see have of the moon.
I have tried to imagine the moon in the
same way, but I cannot visualize it as
a lamp hanging by a chain- I remember
when I was a little girl in the country
we had a lamp, although I did not
know what It was called or what pur¬
pose it served. Why do I not imagine
the moon as a lamp?
My mental ¡mage of the moon is of
a big, hollow porcelain globe I can
somehow feel its smooth surface. That
is how I imagine the full moon. I
imagine the globe to be shining, not
because I have any visual conception
of light or darkness; I have no real idea
of light or darkness, but I have the
epidermal sensations of heat and cold
which run into those of light and dark.
But as those who can see the moon
speak of the moon shining, I think of
it as a shining globe.
As I cannot feel moonlight, however,
it does not appear to me to be as
pleasant, as joyful and life-giving as
sunlight. ' I often smile when I feel the
faint rays of the winter or spring sun
touch my face, but I never smile,
indeed I feel complete indifference,
when someone tells me how bright the
moon is shining. The moon is not
always full, however. When I hear
or read about the crescent moon, I
imagine a thin, carefully cut slice of
pumpkin with one of its sharply pointed
ends uppermost.
I can feel the music
with my hand
I was once invited to a concert in
a club for the blind. I was somewhat
at a loss at first, knowing that I would
not be able to hear the singers, but
everything went well. M.N. told me
the words of the songs on one hand
while S.A. held my other hand and
made it beat in time to the rhythm of the
music. Of course I could get no real
Idea of the tunes which were being
sung, but the rhythm of the music cor¬
responded with the rhythm of the verse
and this In Itself gave me great
pleasure- The day after the concert I
moved around my room to the rhythm
which I had felt through my hand.
I sometimes go to the shows given
for the deaf and dumb in the House
of the Unions in Moscow. Usually
these shows consist mainly of per¬
formances by clowns, acrobats, magi¬
cians and dancers. I cannot follow
this sort of turn very well and so it is
not of any great interest to me.
Somebody usually tells me what is
going on and if I can also follow the
movements of the person who is
"translating" for me, then I can ima¬
gine the things as they happen on the
stage. It Is even better when I sit in
the front row, very near the stage,
and can feel the tapping of the feet
during the dancing.
On one occasion, it was announced
that a Caucasian dancer was to per¬
form in national costume. I had never
seen such a costume, but when the
performer began to dance and I, sitting
in the front row, could feel the gay
rhythm of his feet, it seemed as if I
could almost see this dancing figure
for myself.
I imagined him as being of middle
height (although no one had told me
how tall he was), with a laughing face
and rapid, confident movements. I
could not visualize the upper part of
the costume very clearly, but I could
imagine wide, flapping sleeves and
Turkish-style trousers. As I could feel
the sounds of the piano and the
drumming of his feet, I could imagine
the speed and vigour with which he
was dancing.
The fire of his dancing seemed to
communicate itself to me. I seemed
to be electrified and 1 could have sworn
that I could see the dancer, that I was
running my hands over his body, over
his tunic with the wide sleeves and
his face heated by the dance, and It
seemed to me that he was not at all
tired but, on the contrary, was smiling
broadly, showing big, well-shaped
teeth.
No one had said anything to me
about any of this. This image of the
dancer arose in my imagination only
because I felt the vibration of the
joyous music and the gay drumming of
his feet. I derived great pleasure from
that concert and returned home in the
highest of spirits.
How I visualize
a painting
When I go to a museum and the
person accompanying me tries to des¬
cribe what is represented in a parti¬
cular painting, I listen with Interest
but I do not always Imagine the paint¬
ing as it must really be.
If the painting represents things
with which I am already familiar such
as people, trees, country paths, fami¬
liar birds and animals, I can gather a
rough Idea of it.
If the painting represents, for ins¬
tance, a sunrise or a sunset, a land¬
scape or a stormy sea with a sinking
ship, I imagine the completely smooth
surface of the canvas, which I can
touch with my hands, and the sun or
the sea I imagine quite separately,
quite independent of the painting and
as I have perceived them in nature
the sun warming me with Its rays, the
sea splashing up to my feet and
sending spray over me ; I can even
call to mind the special smell of the
sea.
When I leave the museum, I can
remember the paintings as I perceive
them, that is to say I remember their
dimensions, I can remember the glass
if the painting was under glass and
the frame smooth or carved but not
the pictures themselves, i.e. the things
represented.
I remember only the content, the
subject, plus some other vague recol¬
lections. For this reason I prefer
sculpture, which is completely acces¬
sible to my tactile "sight" and hence
to my understanding. But as I use
the language of those who see and
hear and as I read books, I could
quite well describe probably no
worse than anyone else In fact some
picture which I had never seen but
the subject of which I knew.
Someone reading what I wrote would
probably find it hard to believe that I
had never seen the picture, yet I write
nothing but the truth and I would not
wish to ascribe to myself familiarity
with things which I have not seen or
imagined.

NEW VISTAS
IN SPECIAL EDUCATION
by John McKenna
JOHN McKENNA is Director of Psychology at the St. John of God Child
Guidance Clinic, Dublin, Professor of Psychology at the Royal College
of Surgeons in Ireland and lecturer at University College, Dublin. He is a
Fellow of the Irish and British Psychological Societies and is a member of

Trends of Research in the Field of Special Education ', just published

IfcVERY year many children
begin life with a handicap which
could prevent them from making
a useful contribution to society as
adults. In the absence of special help,
handicapped children can experience
life as more difficult than it need be,
and a sense of alienation can follow
as a consequence. Every child needs
help to adjust to life but some are so
clearly deprived of the requirements
for normal learning that their need for
special help is clearly seen. Let us
take a look at the principal categories
of handicap which can prevent children
from benefiting from ordinary edu¬
cation available to all.

early appropriate treatment and the
minimizing of unfavourable conse¬
quences and sjde-effects resulting
from impaired vision.
There is virtually no limit to the level
of achievement to which the blind can
aspire if appropriately trained teaching
personnel and equipment are available
for their education. For example, blind
students can now do highly advanced
laboratory work, hitherto impossible, in
physics, chemistry and geography,
thanks to research in the use of new
apparatus.
A reading machine has been devel¬
oped in the U.S.S.R. which identifies
words and groups of words rather than
letters, hence speeding the process of
reading. In the U.S.A. at M.I.T., the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
in Boston, a centre specializing in
apparatus for the blind has developed
high-speed electric Braille writers and
a means of converting Braille type¬
setting tapes to spoken words.
The direct conversion of print to
Braille Is a possibility now being ex¬
plored. Improved guidance devices
have also been developed which help
the blind to find their way about with
. less hazards than ever before.
The education of the
deaf child poses one
of the greatest chal¬
lenges to education-
I alists. A serious
hearing defect in
early life can have a lasting effect on
the personality and may be responsible
for Inhibiting the development of the
brain itself, hence affecting Intellectual
functioning.
It is from listening to the adults who
surround them that children learn their
language. The ability to express one's
thoughts in speech constitutes one of
the most important aspects of human
intellectual development, and language
is an essential prerequisite for reading
and writing. That is why early diag¬
nosis of deafness is so important.
Research and observation of young
children indicate that language devel¬
opment goes through various stages
requiring appropriate stimulation at
each stage. Deprivation of sound,
speech and language stimulation can
lead to Incomplete development of
the mind.
While there has been no dramatic
breakthrough in the education of the
deaf, the application of our increased
knowledge of early childhood devel¬
opment is beginning to show favour¬
able results. Improved technological
approaches and transistorized hearing
aids are being Increasingly used
around the world. These, in con¬
junction with more sophisticated
teaching methods, make spoken
language a greater possibility for many
more deaf children, giving them a
greater range of expression than
dactyl speech sign language with
fingers.
For instance, special equipment for
the visual presentation of spoken
words helps the deaf to correct defects
of speech. New electro-acoustic
devices have also been invented which
supplement lip-reading. These so-
called "tactile devices" pass vibrations
to the perception through the touch.
They permit the deaf to differentiate
sounds on an acoustic basis which are
Indistinguishable to them when lip-
reading.
Experiments carried out in the
U.S.S.R. In recent years show that
almost all children with defective
hearing can perceive musical rhythm,
tempo, measure, vibration, rests and
chords. A certain combination of
chords and rests creates "music" for
disturbed
them, allowing them to organize their
movements. Even their peculiar
singing gives deaf children great
aesthetic pleasure.
One group of handi-
capped children
whose needs are
difficult to meet are
the emotionally dis-
turbed. Reactions to
unmet psychological needs show them¬
selves in many ways stuttering, fears
of school, nail-biting, thumb-sucking,
temper tantrums, bed-wetting, stealing,
lying, cruelty and truancy.
Possibly it Is difficult to deal with
such children because they do not
form a homogeneous or readily iden¬
tifiable group. Some are mildly anxious
or disturbed, others are severely
disturbed, some are timid and with¬
drawn, others are aggressive and
delinquent, some appear to improve
without treatment, others deteriorate
and become chronically disturbed. It
is now becoming clear that there are
not enough psychiatrists and psychol¬
ogists to determine which children will
need treatment, or even to attend to
those who do need treatment.
Many emotionally disturbed children
are under-achievers at school. Many
have difficulty in expressing themselves
and this probably makes it much harder
to educate them socially and Inculcate
values and standards. There ¡s a
growing conviction In many places that
the teacher is in the best position to
help such children to achieve scholas¬
tic proficiency and social competence.
Some teacher-training programmes,
especially those for teachers of the
handicapped, are beginning to reflect
this expanded role of the teacher in
relation to emotionally disturbed pupils.
By and large we are beginning to
realize that mental health is Influenced
THE TONOSCOPE
MAKES THE EYES HEAR
The "tonoscope" is a new instrument
which makes sound visible. It is a
box-shaped apparatus (photo far right)
fitted with a speaking tube and covered
by a flexible diaphragm. When a
person speaks into the tube, grains of
sand or coloured quartz on the dia¬
phragm form patterns corresponding
to the sound vibrations (photo right).
Hence the tonoscope offers possibili¬
ties for the deaf, to familiarize them¬
selves with visible patterns of normal
speech and practise reproducing the
same sound forms. The tonoscope was
designed by the late Dr. Hans Jenny,
a Swiss scientist. His collaborator,
Christiaan Stuten, is carrying on
his studies in the new field of research
on vibrations known as Cymatics, at
the Hans Jenny Vibrations Institute, at
Dornach, in Switzerland (see "Unesco
Courier", Dec. 1969).

by the society in which one lives and
that some societies may be more
beneficial for growth than others. A
society which allows each member to
develop physically, intellectually and
emotionally, respecting at the same
time the rights of others to do likewise,
is likeíy to promote mental health.
The school is the place where these
¡deals can best be exemplified and
promoted.
In the last decade
there has been» a
; marked Increase of
research in speech,
| in language and com¬
munication disorders,
and in the. role of experience in the
acquisition of language,..Research has
not only helped in more accurate
diagnosis of different types of speech
defect and suggested special methods
to correct them, but has also indicated,
the necessity for early treatment.
In the U.S.S.R.. stuttering, a universal
problem, is treated, even before the
child enters school, not as an in¬
dependent symptom, but in the general
context of psychological development.
A special technique involving manual
work with pre-school children Is
showing promising results in the
elimination of stuttering.
In the U.S.A. research on stuttering
has also concentrated on general
personality factors, but many speech
therapists are treating stuttering as a
symptom. Practice and research on
the speech-handicapped in the U.S.A.
as in many other countries, however,
does not appear to be well integrated
in educational programming. This
would suggest that speech pathology
should occupy a more Important place
in the training of teachers, since we
know that speech ¡s a necessary
basis for reading and writing.
Follow-up studies on
I children who have
spent some "time in
hospital show that
separation from par-
ents and home can
have a damaging effect on the person¬
ality. The younger the child and the
longer the period away from the per¬
sonal attention and affection of the
family the greater the chance for
personality disturbance and the more
irreversible the consequences.
With the increase of pediatric spe¬
cialists, hospitalization has changed
very much in character. Steps are
now taken to protect young children
from the effects of being deprived of
their mothers and of their affection.
For those children where the basic
foundations for healthy development
have already been laid, Illness and hos¬
pitalization need not necessarily entail
special education.
At the end of the 1960s in edu¬
cational reviews in the U.S.A. the cate¬
gory of "health Impaired" was repre¬
sented solely by learning disabilities.
The labels they used for brain
disorders and learning difficulties
referred to those pupils who presented
themselves as a special problem be¬
cause of their failure in one specific
area, often reading, although they might
be otherwise bright and Intelligent.
Research will probably throw more
light on the "late developer", the
supposed dullard at school who
achieves remarkable success in more
practical work after leaving school. It
promises to throw more light on one
of the great problems for teachers
those pupils who, otherwise bright,
fail to achieve a mastery of reading.
In many ways men-
I tally handicapped
I children present the
greatest potential
source of social
problems in modern,
complex, urbanized societies. There
are different degrees of mental retard¬
ation and hence the needs of the
handicapped vary considerably.
Because of their lower levels of
Intelligence, work with the mentally
handicapped presents many problems
and difficulties not found in the other
categories of handicapped. Despite .
this, it is in the field of the mentally
handicapped that the most progressive
developments are taking place around
the world.
In Sweden, for example, the tradi¬
tional system of special classes for
slow learners has been challenged
since the 1960s. Doubts have been
raised about the appropriateness of
placing the handicapped in a secluded
milieu. Swedish research projects
appeared to confirm the main conclu¬
sions from American studies that the
advantages of placing mentally handi¬
capped children In special classes
were not evident for all categories.
The research suggested that the spe¬
cial classes tended to lower the child- 4 "f
ren's self-esteem. Hence special educ- | |
ation methods are being carefully re¬
assessed and new arrangements tried.

ON DECK
Using a "natural language" of gestures (almost identical all over the world), to
which conventional signs have been added over the years, deaf persons have no
trouble in understanding each other (see article next page). Here we show a
selection of signs from this international language, published as a deck of playing
cards by the U.S. National Association of the Deaf, and reproducing 26 word
signs commonly used by deaf persons. The deck (52 cards and a joker) comprises
26 pairs of cards: one card with a word sign and a picture of the object it repre¬
sents; the other with the same word sign, but with only the object's written
name. In addition to gesture language, deaf and deaf-mute persons have an
international hand alphabet in which special positions of the fingers and hands
stand for letters or figures. The alphabet was first developed by the Abbé Charles
de l'Épée, a famous French teacher of the deaf, in the 18th century and with slight
modifications was later adapted for international use by the World Federation
of the Deaf. The deaf quickly develop great facility and speed at finger spelling.

CESARE MAGAROTTO has been Secretary-
General of the World Federation of the Deaf
since its foundation in 1951. He is Director-
General of the Italian National Association
of the Deaf and Dumb. (ENS) and President
of the State Technical Institute for the Deaf
and Dumb in Rome.. He has published
numerous studies on ' deafness, including-
"Problems of the Deaf", Rome. ENS. 7955

nicate. The gesture for "come here",
for example, can equally well be
expressed as an Imperative command
or as an affectionate invitation.
Persons who can hear use gestures
merely to emphasize spoken language
and communicate shades and intensity
of meaning through the tones and
modulations of the voice. But the deaf
express these feelings and nuances
through appropriate facial expressions
and by modulating the gestures.
Gestures, like man's first vocal ex¬
pressions, date back to prehistoric
times and formed a valid system of
communication which could be easily
understood by different peoples be¬
cause ¡t always related to concrete
things.
Proof of the common origin of "na¬
tural gestures" lies in the fact that
even today they are almost identical
or so similar that deaf Europeans
manage to communicate just as well
with American Indians as with tribes
of Africa and South America.
Deaf people from anywhere irr the
world are able not only to understand
each other, but can communicate effec¬
tively after a few hours' "conversa¬
tion", used mainly to check the con¬
ventional signs which over many cen¬
turies have been added to natural
ones.
If we think for a moment how dif¬
ficult it is to reach mutual understand¬
ing among persons speaking different
languages, thinking along different
lines and often quibbling over trivia
lities, and if we consider what an
impact this has had and is still having
on international relations, we have to
admire the deaf. Through the language
of gestures, which they practise and
keep alive, the deaf are able to estab¬
lish friendly relations across any
frontier.
In 1951, at the first Congress in
Rome constituting the World Federa¬
tion of the Deaf, it was possible to
observe that reality. The Congress
was attended by the representatives
of 25 countries with national associa¬
tions of the deaf, an well as specia¬
lists, doctors, educationalists, audio-
logists and psychologists.
There were lengthy debates but the
quickest and most practical conclusions
were drawn by the deaf. Using their
own language, they were able to
discuss and decide on the constitution
of the World Federation which today
covers 54 countries and numbers hun- "
dreds of experts In various disciplines
from every continent. No political
issues, no partisan views, no legal
quibbles hampered their clear, precise
argument.
Deaf people (and here we mean
those who cannot even hear with a
hearing aid) can be taught to speak
and to understand lip-reading.
But this "art" involves considerable
limitations and difficulties, added to
the abysmally isolating effect of deaf¬
ness itself. Consequently the deaf
make considerable efforts -and sacri¬
fices to adjust themselves to the world
of sound (unnatural to them), and

### 50232: Towards an international language of gestures; the World Federation of the Deaf has been compiling since 1951 a dictionary of signs for universal use

The deaf have evolved
a shorthand language of
hand signs and gestures
for use In conferences
and meetings. Photos
show how the words
United Nations and Unesco
are formed. Far left,
crossed hands signify "to
unite", "union", or "United
Nations". If this sign
is then followed by the
gesture for "organization
on a world scale", top left,
the words "United Nations
Organization" are indicat¬
ed. If the first gesture is
followed by the sign for
"education", bottom left,
the meaning Is "Unesco".
Other U.N. agencies have
"U.N." plus another sign.
to develop their personality, their cul¬
ture, their rehabilitation, and the use
of leisure in their communities, aiming
to offer society the fruits of their
experience and abilities.
In Italy, for example, thanks to the
action of the National Association of
the Deaf, a special programme for the
deaf Is televised every Tuesday even¬
ing with the announcer using lan¬
guage gestures. It features reports
on the most important news of the
week followed by variety and cultural
items. The programme is much appre¬
ciated by the deaf, and in numerous
other countries the deaf are asking
for a similar television feature.
At the same time Italy, like the
U.S.A., the U.S.S.R., Denmark, Sweden
and other countries, is organizing for
its cultural centres of the deaf the
circulation of video tapes with sub¬
titles and gesture-language to replace
sound.
The use of sign language among
the deaf Is lost in the mists of time
and, as we see, there is a "natural
language" which Is the same or similar
all over the world and which enables
the deaf to understand one another
easily.
Over the centuries conventional ges¬
tures have been added to this natural
language. In 1951 the World Fed¬
eration of the Deaf decided to compile
a "Dictionary of Gestures for Inter¬
national Conferences" in order to pro¬
vide for everyone the possibility of
accurate and rational Interpretation.
The first instalment appeared in 1961
after ten years spent In methodically
collecting the conventional gestures
most frequently used in International
conferences and seminars. Thousands
of gestures were recorded and care¬
fully screened. Lack of funds meant
that it was possible to publish only
a small volume of 339 photographs
and an English and French glossary.
In 1971 the second volume was
published, containing a further 300 of
the most important gestures used In
international conferences.
At the present time a committee
of experts is engaged In compiling a
new dictionary of over 1,500 words
which is to be presented at the
Seventh Congress of the World
Federation of the Deaf to be held In
Washington, in 1975.
The work is particularly complex
as it consists In examining scores of
publications from different countries,
selecting the terms most frequently
used in international conferences,
picking out those which originated in
natural gestures without reference to
alphabetical signs, confirming exact
rules which are already an integral
part of the sign language and permit
abstract discourse, and so on.
We hope that as in the past this
enterprising work of the deaf and their
culture may be of service to the world
community. It is worthwhile recalling
that the international language of the
deaf is the basis of the sign language
used by underwater divers, crane op¬
erators, airline personnel and others
who work in noisy surroundings or In
conditions of complete silence, such
as radio and TV studios. It is also
the basis of the little glossaries of
100 signs translated into 36 languages
which airlines issue to their cabin staff
and to passengers for communicating
in an emergency.
But the most urgent need of man¬
kind is peace and understanding among
all peoples. The international sign
language may perhaps make Its own
special contribution towards achieving
this aspiration.

### 50235: The Man who refused to die

THE MAN
WHO
REFUSED
TO DIE
by Thomas Boswell

Reproduction prohibited
m ROM the moment on
a November day in 1966, when he was
thrown to the mat during wrestling
practice at St. Albans School in Wash¬
ington (U.S.A.), and heard his neck
snap, he knew what had happened.
"My body from the neck down was
floating in space. Only my head was
on the ground."
"The doctors", said William's mother
calmly, "told him right away, 'Gene, we
can't establish a close personal rela¬
tionship with you. Ninety-seven per¬
cent of our spinal cord patients die." "
While in traction for six weeks in the
intensive care unit of a local hospital,
Williams heard patients in adjoining
beds enter, conscious or unconscious,
and eventually die.
One death was more important than
others. Williams says it, in part, "ins¬
pired me."
A construction worker who had fallen
five stories was brought in uncons¬
cious. "I heard about the accident on
the radio", recalled Williams. "He
never regained consciousness and I
never saw him, but for five days I lis¬
tened to his breathing in the next bed."
At some deep level, Williams feels, he
decided not to quit and die. And then
he almost did die. Not once, but
several times.
With holes drilled in his skull for
traction, he developed bursitis of the
jaw, couldn't eat and lost 75 pounds.
Like all longterm bed patients, he was
prey to Infection. In February, a blad¬
der infection sent his fever over
104 degrees F.
"The doctors told me, 'See, Mrs
Williams? We told you not to get
your hopes up' " said the mother.
Desperate and furious, the mother
cursed the specialists "who had almost
killed Gene", and followed the advice
of "a great male practical nurse."
The two packed the emaciated boy

player (No. 52) before his accident.
in ice and gave him alcohol baths for
eight hours until the fever abated.
In June, 1967, Mrs. Williams, looking
almost as haggard as her son, wheeled
the patient out of the hospital against
doctors' orders and off to the Rusk
Institute In New York City.
Williams entered Rusk "just skin and
bones", according to Dr. Donald Co-
valt, associate director of the institute
at New York University.
His injury, a cervical fracture (bet¬
ween the fifth and sixth vertebrae), left
Williams a "high-level quadriplegic"
that is, paralyzed in all four extremities.
The long rehabilitation in which Wil¬
liams learned to use what arm, wrist
and chest muscles he had left was,
according to both Williams and his
father, "one long athletic event. The
simplest movement was a wrestling
match."
Williams entered Rusk a near-Invalid,
but left driving a car.
With limited use of arms and wrists,
but none of the hands, Williams could
wheel himself to his car, hoist himself
into the front seat, haul his wheel¬
chair in and drive. "The car was a
lifesaver for him", said his father.
The story of Gene Williams, who is
now 24, is "a mile or two beyond any¬
thing I've ever seen here before",
according to Dr. Covalt. The patient
does not see it that way.
"Once I decided not to die, a clear
choice never presented itself", he said.
"You go with what you've got."
He went back to St. Albans to finish
his senior year In 1968 and to help
coach the football team. "He was a
damn good coach", said St. Albans
athletic director Gary Gardiner, who
remembers Williams's chair being
carried down the cathedral steps at
graduation by teammates.
Refusing to give up the pleasures
he could retain, Williams began going
anywhere he pleased, becoming fier¬
cely independent. "Most 'wheelies'
call ahead everywhere to find out if
there are accomodations for them.
How high the curbs are. I show up
at restaurants, movies, anywhere, and
and then cope with what's there."
In 1970, with a huge supply of cran¬
berry juice to fight the bladder and
kidney stones and infections that
plague and often kill paraplegics,
Williams went to Harvard.
There his appetite ranged from musi-
cology (his major) and political
science, to psychosomatic médecine
and neuroanatomy.
During his Harvard years, he took
two trips to Mexico alone. The Inde¬
pendence of the Mexico trips, picking
up hitchhikers, caring for himself, is
to Dr. Covalt the most remarkable per¬
formance by a quadriplegic in his
experience, illustrating why "this man
will be a success in whatever he
attempts."
Praise for his fortitude is one of
Williams's principal irritations. "This
idea of me attacking life is really stu¬
pid." he said. Every attempt he makes
to live normally is seen as another
example of his abnormality.
"I would like to think I would have
developed the same way I have,
without the injury", said Williams. He
is not certain, nor ever can be.
Would the original Gene Williams
have become passionately interested
in music and the healing arts? Would
he have been in the march on the
Pentagon in a wheelchair? Would he
now be a jazz percussionist with his
own progressive group in Cambridge?
"I like to think so. But really, I can't
say whether I'm better off or worse off
than if I hadn't been hurt."
Doctors predict a near-normal life
expectancy for him. M

ABOLISHING
THE GHETTOS FOR
DISABLED CITIZENS
Physical and social barriers
still prevent the total integration
of the handicapped in society
by Norman Acton
NORMAN ACTON is Secretary-General of
Rehabilitation International, the world's
largest federation of organizations providing
services for the disabled. He is also chair¬
man of the Council of World Organizations
Interested in the Handicapped, a co-ordinat¬
ing group of 37 major International non¬
governmental organizations. Founding Presi¬
dent of the International Sports Organization
for the Disabled, he has been a consultant
on problems of the handicapped to the U.N..
Unesco and UNICEF.
LT least one out of every
ten children requires what is called
special education. These are the
children who are called "disabled" or
"handicapped" or sometimes "excep¬
tional". They need specialized guid¬
ance, technical aids, modified physical
arrangements of the school and class¬
room and programmes designed
specifically to enable them to achieve
the goals of education.
The Declaration of the Rights of the
Child, adopted by the United Nations
General Assembly in 1959, states that
each child shall be given an education
which will enable him to become a
useful member of society. That goal
is especially important for the handi¬
capped child and much more difficult
to achieve. The difficulties are to
varying degrees consequences of the
individual disabilities, but also they are
products of society's attitudes towards
handicapped persons.
Active involvement of the community
in its special education programme is
one of the key ingredients of the

FOR DISABLED CITIZENS (Continued)
effort to overcome these difficulties.
Let us look at some of the details
on which the above generalizations
are based.
What do we mean by community
involvement?
The basic function of the community .
In this field Is, of course, to provide
special education facilities; to finance
them through taxation and other means;
and to incorporate them in the general
educational scheme. The methods and
structure may vary, but there is wide
international acceptance of the concept
that the provision of special education
is a public responsibility of the
community and its government.
Conclusions of the First International
Conference on Legislation Concerning
the Disabled, organized by Rehabili¬
tation International In Rome In 1971,
were that "governments must accept
major responsibility and play a main
role in the development and provision
of rehabilitation services for all persons
with physical and mental disabilities,"
and that "education should be provided
without cost to the individual or the
individual's family."
This is not to overlook the vital role
played by voluntary organizations in
starting and providing special edu¬
cation services. In many countries
parents' groups and other private
bodies have been the first to be aware
of the problems which exist when
there are no special educational
facilities. They have themselves
provided the first services and have
been instrumental in persuading their
governments to either launch official
programmes or support private efforts.
LN interesting example of
the progression from private initiative
to governmental services is found in
the experience of the Zurich School
Programme for the Mentally Retarded.
Despite a highly developed general
educational system, Switzerland in the
1930s had no public facilities for the
education of the severely mentally
retarded. They were either kept at
home or placed in residential Insti¬
tutions. In 1937, Dr. Maria Egg started
with private support a day school for
children who were not admitted to the
regular schools because they were
classified as "ineducable".
For ten years, Dr. Egg and her
associates demonstrated that these
children could be trained to have good
habits and social behaviour, they could
learn self-help and various manual
skills, they could be taught to express
themselves through speech, music and
art, some could master simple scholas¬
tic skills, and all could be helped to
a happier life. Living with their
families, their growth was as nearly
normal as possible; living in the
community, their progress was a public
testimony to the success of Dr. Egg's
initiative.
After a decade of this remarkable
work under private auspices, the
Zurich Municipal Council recognized
its value and incorporated the school
in the public school system. Sub¬
sequently, inspired by the accomplish¬
ments in Zurich, more than 50 com¬
munities in Switzerland have opened
similar day-care schools for the
severely retarded.
Community involvement should also
mean that the population in general is
informed of the need for and the value
of special education facilities. Its
support should be forthcoming not only
through taxation and the general
approval implied by public education
systems, but in much more specific
understanding of the problem. Special
education for a useful life must be
given in the atmosphère of the com¬
munity, and can succeed only when
the members of the community are
informed enough to accept and deal
with its handicapped members in a
mature manner.
This requires broad community
education through all of the usual
channels: the press, radio, television,
public meetings, service club projects,
adult education courses and others.
Understanding is advanced by success¬
ful examples, as was the case In Zurich
when Dr. Egg's pupils demonstrated
to the public that their abilities could
make them acceptable.
Why Is community involvement
essential to the success of a special
education programme?

Designed for the use of the able-bodied, our
cities and buildings are full of major and even
insurmountable barriers for the disabled. Steep
stairways, narrow doorways and corridors, high
street kerbs are only a few of the obstacles that
plague the physically handicapped. Today how¬
ever, at the urging of many public and private
organizations which have been studying the pro¬
blem, architects and planners have begun to
design buildings with the requirements of the
handicapped in mind. Unesco, for instance, has
foreseen such needs in the design of an additional
building for its Paris H.Q. Photos on this page,
illustrating some aspects of the problem, are taken
from a special issue of " Les Cahiers de la Vie
Quotidienne " (April-June 1973) on housing and the
handicapped. Published in Paris by the French
National Liaison Committee for the Rehabilitation
of the Handicapped, the issue presents an inter¬
national cross-section of projects for making life
easier for the disabled.
Stairways need no longer be a hazard for the disabled. Stair treads
should never have protruding edges (top right). Aids to safety are
stair risers inclining outwards and anti-slip material on stair edges
(bottom right). Hand rails, following the incline of the stairs, should
be 85 cm. above them and 90 cm. above landings.
Left, recently designed pe¬
destrian crossing that helps
the handicapped to get down
from the kerb and cross the
street safely. Easily identifi¬
ed paving material enables
the blind to locate the cross¬
ing point and a non-slip sur¬
face helps the disabled to
maneuvre wheel-chairs. The
crossing has gently sloping
ramps to the street and a
clear passage through the
traffic island.
Above, passages in a building should be at least 1.20 m. wide and
1.30 m. at corners to allow wheel-chairs to manoeuvre. Below,
slope of access ramp should not exceed 1 in 20 and the handrail
should be no higher than 96 cm. above the ramp.

ABOLISHING THE GHETTOS
FOR DISABLED CITIZENS
(Continued from page 24)
Special education facilities can
succeed only when they are used. It
is a distressing fact that, even today,
too many parents are reluctant to admit
that they have a disabled or retarded
child. Others are unaware of the
existence of the means of help, or
unconvinced of the merit of permitting
their child to leave the shelter of the
home or of an institution.
Here, then, is a vital function for the
community and its organizations. To
locate such children and their families,
to persuade them to take advantage of
educational opportunities and to help
them to do so. These functions can
be performed much more easily in an
atmosphere where the members of the
community are giving and receiving
helpful actions, where there is com¬
munity Involvement.
u1 NTIL recently in Latin Ame¬
rica, the problem of cerebral palsy was
of unknown prevalence because so
many afflicted children were hidden
from public knowledge. Now, however,
there is general recognition that the
numbers suffering disability because of
cerebral palsy are large and that
effective rehabilitation programmes, in¬
cluding, particularly, special education,
are essential if these people are to be
able to live useful lives. The reason
for this change is primarily the activity
of groups of parents of cerebral palsied
children in various countries in the
region.
Coming together first in an effort to
solve their individual problems, these
parents quickly realized the need for
special educational and other facilities
and set about creating them. As
word spread that something could be
done to assist children seriously handi¬
capped from this cause, many more
parents came forward with their
children. As the numbers of recog¬
nized cases grew, it was possible
to establish better schools and training
centres, to attract experts in the
needed fields and eventually to
convince governments to assist or
establish rehabilitation programmes,
including special education for the
cerebral palsied.
Today, in Caracas, in Bogota, in
Lima, in Buenos Aires, in Rio de Janeiro
and elsewhere, it is possible to find
active and effective services to assist
children with cerebral palsy and, in
every case, organizations such as
parents' groups have played a major
role in the Inception of the programme
and continue to be active in the work.
The challenge of spreading their
attitudes, knowledge and methods to
the rural areas and to the less
developed countries remains.

THE THEATRE
OF THE SILENT
Shakespeare, Schiller, Gogol, Aeschylus,
performed by deaf-mute actors
LS the theatre lights dim
slowly, the clash of a gong announces
that the performance is about to begin.
Silence falls as the audience hears the
sound. The actors perceive the sound
waves as a physical sensation mounting
through the soles of their feet and
take their places on the stage.
But the silence remains unbroken
throughout the performance. Cos¬
tumes and scenery are unnecessary:
body-hugging black tights and white-
painted faces are all the props needed.
Body and face become the focal point
of Aspects of Man, a pantomime
created by the theatre group of
Special Evening School No. 2028 for
Deaf Adolescents and Adults, in
Santa Fe, Argentina.
Here, the gestures usual In the
normal child from the age of eight
months, which constitute a sign, rep¬
resenting a situation or object, become
the symbols of a more abstract
language In the case of handicapped
children. Loss of hearing is compen¬
sated by highly developed powers of
observation and translation Into terms
of gesture which enable the performers
to give expression, often in a very
symbolic manner, to the realities of
their universe.
This theatre group, which is directed
by a psycho-pedagogical specialist,
Professor Néstor Didier, has not only
given performances In Santa Fe and
other Argentinian cities, but was the
only deaf-mute group at the First Latin-
American Mime Congress and Festival,
held in Buenos Aires in August 1973.
With the conviction that the theatre
can be used as a remedial aid,
Professor Didier launched this type of
activity five years ago in the Special
School, producing pantomime with the
participation of all the pupils, whose
ages range from 15 to 35. The most
gifted among them go on to join the
theatre group.
After a prolonged period of adap¬
tation and familiarization members
work together in groups. The disci¬
pline includes individual and collective
concentration upon given situations,
with themes suggested by pupils,
gradually progressing from the concrete
Simple imitation or representation of
an object or a situation to the
abstract, involving concepts such as
Science, Politics, Love, Friendship,
God. Professor Didier considers that
communication of this kind facilitates
learning of the various subjects taught
in school.
The group's success at the First
Latin-American Mime Festival led Its
organizers to request Professor Didier
to give a series of short courses on
the theatre for handicapped persons
in general, in other words, not only
for the deaf and dumb, but also for
the blind an unusual and fascinating
experiment which merits the closest
attention.
At the 6th Congress of the World
Federation of the Deaf, held at Unesco
Headquarters In Paris in August 1971,
the Director of the Santa Fe Special
School stated that he had observed
that the pupils' drama activities en¬
abled each Individual to acquire a
deeper knowledge of his or her own
personality. Drama was thus extremely
effective in helping the handicapped to
overcome their inhibitions, to establish
closer relationships within the group
and to Improve their social contacts In
general.
During the same Congress, Pro¬
fessor V. Indjef of Bulgaria spoke of
the rôle of pantomime in visual and
movement co-ordination, in visual per¬
ception and in the enrichment of the
sign language of the deaf. He stressed
that this art above all others helped
the deaf to overcome their feelings of
inferiority.
Italy's Professor N. Palazzotto went
even further. After pointing out the
widely recognized educational rôle of
the theatre In general as a stimulus to
creativity and acquiring culture, he
underlined the therapeutic value of
pantomime for the deaf.
Mime requires a continuous gym¬
nastic and respiratory preparation
which is an extremely important factor
In the process of speech rehabilitation
of deaf children. In view of this, he
strongly recommended the teaching of
mime in all schools for the deaf,
whatever the level or grade.
Another aspect of this art is pre¬
sented by the Moscow Theatre of
Mime and Gesture, a team of deaf
and dumb actors directed by Victor
S. Znamerovsky. Not only has
Znamerovsky succeeded in making
each actor discover his own "voice",
his personal "tone" in the gesture,
the smile, in the sudden change of
expression, but he has also managed
to a certain extent to reconstruct the
"text" of the works performed.
The company's repertory includes
Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound; Sha¬
kespeare's Twelfth Night ; Intrigue and
Love by Schiller; Marriage by Gogol,
and a number of works by contempor¬
ary Soviet writers, such as That Time
in Seville, a story by S. Aleshin about
Don Juan, and The Enchanted Island by
Y. Jaritonov. The group has performed
with outstanding success outside the
Soviet Union, notably In Sofia, Warsaw
and Budapest.
The same "fidelity" to the text is
also characteristic of the Deutsches
Gehörlosen Theater (The German
Theatre of the Deaf) from Dortmund,
Federal Republic of Germany, which
performed Shakespeare's Romeo and
Juliet and Büchner's Woyzeck In Paris
during the 6th Congress of the World
Federation of the Deaf.
H1ERE one should certainly
mention a curious experience common
to both the Argentine and the Soviet
troupes. In the pantomime Aspects of
Man the voice of an invisible narrator
sometimes supplements the gestures
and links up the various sketches.
When The Enchanted Island was filmed
(the film won the Silver Dragon award
at the Cracow international film festival m>j
in Poland), it had to be dubbed for //
persons with normal hearing. In other
words, the language of the deaf, just
like any other language in the world,

THE THEATRE
OF THE SILENT (Continued)
needs to be translated or interpreted
for those who are unfamiliar with it.
A rather different case from these
two is the National Theater of the Deaf
in Connecticut, U.S.A. Founded and
directed by David Hays, a well-known
Broadway set-designer, this company
toured North America, Europe and
the Middle East, performing before
aijdiences in which over 80 per cent of
the spectators had normal hearing.
This is a troupe of professional
actors, and is particularly distinguished
for its liveliness. Since the entire
performance is based on gestures, the
members of the troupe are intensely
observant and seem twice as alive as
most other actors. As Hays points
out, however, the Theater of the Deaf
is not "help for the handicapped." So
the real aim is to educate the public,

"Our biggest problem", says Hays,
"is to break through uninformed atti¬
tudes concerning deaf people and
obtain the feeling we want in terms of
appreciating the theatre company for
fully entertaining, fresh and beautiful

The best summary of the group's
objectives is that given by one of the
actors "We just want to be judged as
performers." Far from seeking any form
whatever of sympathy or paternalism,
this attitude already takes for granted

HENRY VISCARDI Jnr. of the United States was born legless. He paid
his way through university =by refereeing basketball games from a wheel¬
chair and working as a sports reporter. "Abilities Inc.". a company he
founded in 1952 to demonstrate that disabled men and women can become
skilled workers, has since grown into a unique complex of educational and
vocational training centres. He has written seven books on the rehabi¬
litation of the disabled including an autobiography, "A Man's Stature" (John
Day, New York. 1952), "Give Us the Tools" (1959), "The School" (1964) and
"The Abilities Story" (1967) all published by Paul S. Eriksson Inc., New York.

I| was born without legs.
I lived most of my early life without
them, horribly deformed, an object of
pity and sometimes scorn. I was so
different that other children called me
"Ape Man". Something happened
over the years to change this.
Many years- have passed since my
childhood as a crippled boy. Edu¬
cation and rehabilitation were not
formalized then. They occurred in the
daily struggle of life. If anyone helped
you it was on an individual basis.
Some people have a proven flair
for transmitting powerful invitations to
others to regard life as pointless and

hopeless. They seem to be gifted at
getting others to give up, yield, give
in. They kill the dream, paralyze the
hope, cripple the joy. We all know
people like that and we are undone in
their presence.
Helen Keller, although blind and
deaf, was not one of these. She was
one of those splendid unforgettable
people who Invite us to life.
Thirty-five years ago when I was 27,
I received my first set of artificial limbs
in New York City where I was
born. War started shortly afterwards.
I became a field officer in the American
Red Cross. As an experience it is
one for which I can never give enough
thanks. For one thing, starting a new
life on artificial limbs where I stood
straight and tall for the first time, I was
born anew. It was a whole new life.
I was like a child.
After the war I turned to the world
of work and was well on my way to a
Vice-Presidency in a large national
organization. I could not resist the
urge to return to the world of the
disabled and in 1952 "Abilities, Inc."
was founded as a workshop for the
disabled.
It supports itself out of earnings,
pays prevailing wages, engages In
complex electronic work, banking and
clerical tasks and glass engraving of
exquisite beauty. Since its beginning
over 20 years ago, thousands of
disabled persons have come to be
trained, to work and, for many, to pass
on to other rewarding careers in
private industry. Many have remained,
some for 15 or 20 years.
All are covered by complete
medical, surgical benefits, sick leave
and vacation policies, life insurance
and disability benefits for total and
permanent disability and all are covered
by a retirement plan which will allow
retirement on 50 to 90 per cent of
salary in addition to social security
benefits of approximately $300 a month.
Yet all were so disabled at the time
of employment that they could not find
a job.
This remarkable record Includes
surpassing economic achievement
over a period of less than 20 years.
In that period of time these disabled
workers manufactured goods valued at
$48,000,000. They received salaries
totalling $25,544,000 They as workers
paid $5,749,000 In taxes. In insurance,
rehabilitation, public education and
benefit programmes a total of
$21,280,000 was invested.
If these same people had remained
on welfare rolls or had been otherwise
supported, it would have cost over
$11,000.000. Add this to what they
earned and produced and the total of
new wealth which they returned to the
community because they worked and
produced would be $112,000,000 over
a period of less than 20 years. I find
it difficult to estimate what they brought
to their lives In dignity and personal
happiness through working and pro¬
ducing instead of being supported.

Resources Center, set up by "Abilities,

Inc.", conducted In co-operation with
industry, 138 physically disabled per¬
sons were placed In jobs after
evaluation and training. Not sedentary,
unrewarding jobs, but jobs of tomorrow
related to data preparation and data
analysis and to the new era of com¬
puter technology. These were jobs
in which workers were needed and for
which these handicapped persons had
the necessary physical, mental and
emotional capacities.
It Is Interesting to recognize that
both the worker and the work can be
changed to adjust to each other. The
worker can be better educated,
rehabilitated, fitted with prosthetic
devices to meet the capacities he
needs for work. Likewise, the job can
be modernized and simplified, its
requirements modified to match the
capacities of the worker. It Is not a
one-way street. Both are changeable;
they can and should be changed to
complement one another.
There has been in the past a lack
of career awareness in U.S. schools.
For the disabled student and in fact
for all students we must change the
attitude in education that the non-
academically Inclined are considered
second class citizens.
In the Human Resources School a
recent survey of 65 severely disabled
students who graduated from our high
school showed that 47 went on to
further education. These were students
who prior to coming to the school
were so severely disabled that they
were homebound and received a
minimal education from a visiting
teacher. Eighteen of these graduates
went on to four-year colleges and
20 to two-year colleges.
One alumnus has gone on to law
school after college graduation. One
is employed as a computer programmer
and working for his master's degree.
Another is attending graduate school
and working for his master's degree.
Education has made it possible to
increase the level of independence of
these disabled young people. Career
awareness must begin in the early
childhood grades of schooling. It
prepares the disabled child for the
competitive world of work and supplies
the basic skills too for job maturity.
Without career education, rehabilitation
Is meaningless.
From its humble beginnings in 1952
as a workshop for the disabled, Human
Resources Center has now become a
place where learning and growth are
passwords to the future. Its Research
and Training Institute conducts studies
in psychology, special education,
vocational rehabilitation, and bio-
engineering. In its evaluation and
training programmes over 250 persons
each year are placed in jobs. Ten
thousand persons each year attend
Its seminar and training programmes.
Human Resources School with
200 severely disabled students from
preschool through high school is fully
accredited and recognized by the State
of New York.
"Abilities, Inc." with 185 workers is
a living laboratory in which the belief
in career education and rehabilitation
provides the opportunity for inde¬
pendence and productive dignity.

ELECTRONIC SIGHT'
Researchers at the University of Utah (U.S.A.) and the University
of Western Ontario (Canada) have successfully stimulated arti¬
ficial sight in the blind with an electronic system that bypasses the
retina of the eye and the optic nerve. Sixty-four electrodes
Implanted in the visual cortex of the brain were connected to a
computer and to TV cameras. Dots of light projected on the TV
screen were transmitted to the brain via the computer. Two blind
patients could see the dots and one of them could make out
different patterns. Above, artist's impression of how the system
may ultimately help the blind to "see". A minute TV camera in
a glass eye would be placed in each eye socket and a mini¬
computer would be concealed in the spectacles' frame. Signals
would go to a tiny transmitter in the scalp and be passed into
the brain via an implanted receiver and electrodes.

### 50275: UNESCO and special education for the handicapped

UNESCO and special education
for the handicapped
by
Nils-lvar Sundberg
WITH the passage of years
education of the handicapped has
been taking an increasingly important
place In the work of Unesco. The
vastness of the problem and the need
for international co-operation to get to
grips with it have become progress¬
ively clearer with the publication of
data on the number of handicapped In
the world.
It is now estimated that on earth
there are about 400,000,000 handi¬
capped people, that Is to say nearly
the combined population of the United
States and the U.S.S.R. Most of these
handicapped people are uneducated
and unskilled, but the work of Unesco
to help educate them and improve their
lives has been growing over the years.
Unesco, with comparatively small
funds at its disposal, is making a
world-wide Impact on the problem.
One of its main objectives has been
to convince the nations that education
of the handicapped is not merely an
ethical duty but that it pays. For
instance, in the United States it is
estimated that every dollar paid for
rehabilitation gives a return of 35 dol¬
lars. The cost of rehabilitation is
usually repaid by the taxes of the
rehabilitated person within ten years
(see article page 28.)
In Central America disabled persons
living in remote agricultural com¬
munities were brought to the capital
and trained in such jobs as hair-
dressing, tailoring, woodwork and
radio-repairing. When they returned
to their villages they usually earned
three or four times what they would
have obtained had they been able-
bodied agricultural workers.
Unesco began shortly after it was
founded in 1946 to grapple with the
problem of educating the millions of
innocent victims of World War II. It
appreciated the need for special
education not only for the blind, the
deaf, the maimed and the mentally
NILS-IVAR SUNDBERG, of Sweden, has di¬
rected Unesco's programme of Special Edu¬
cation for Handicapped Children and Young
People since it started In 1968. Formerly
Director for Special Education in Stockholm
and lecturer at the Stockholm School of Edu¬
cation, he was for nine years Advisory
Officer at the Swedish National Board of
Education on questions of special education
for the handicapped, including teacher train¬
ing and curriculum planning.
retarded but also for the countless
children whose nervous system had
been shattered by the war. During
those early years Unesco published
a series of studies for the guidance of
educators in all countries on the
national and international measures
needed to face the challenge.
Unesco gave particular attention to
international co-operation in teaching
the blind. Shortly after its foundation
it decided to promote a survey of
problems aimed at establishing world
Braille uniformity. It obtained the
services as consultant of Sir Clutha
Mackenzie, of New Zealand, an inde¬
fatigable worker for the blind who had
lost his sight during World War I.
His goal was to produce a univer¬
sally acceptable plan for the application
of Braille to all languages, thus
fulfilling the hopes of Louis Braille, the
blind French professor, who in 1829
invented his alphabet of raised dots
for finger-reading. Louis Braille was
convinced that his method could be
applied to any language, but since
there was no international body at that
time to achieve world-wide uniformity,
a chaos of dissimilar Braille prints
developed in the various countries
over the years.
As a "Unesco Courier" article
pointed out in March 1952, "almost
from the start, enthusiasts of the
Braille idea in many countries began
juggling the dots around in different
combinations. Soon the same patterns
of six dots came to be used to express
different letters not only in different
languages but even in the same lang¬
uage.
"In Great Britain, for example, the
Bible had already been printed in no
fewer than five systems by 1868, and
that year the British and Foreign Blind
Association (now the National Institute
for the Blind) decided in favour of the
original Braille. In the United States,
three arrangements came into use.
One group adopted French Braille, as
Britain had done. Another modified
many of the signs on the principle of
the fewest dots to the most frequently
recurring letters. A third group turned
the axis of the Braille rectangle from
the vertical to the horizontal.
"Only in 1932 did an agreement
between the United Kingdom and the
United States fix "Standard English
Braille" as the contracted or abbrevi
ated form for everyday use throughout
the English-speaking world.
"Similar divergent systems intro¬
duced In German, modern Greek and
Hebrew Brailles also yielded in due
time to a return to the original French.
"But variations existed in Braille
used in Spain and Portugal and the
different Latin American countries.
Because of the added factor of varied
scripts and the absence of any
recognized symbols for letter-sounds
not used in the Latin alphabet, Asian
and African language Braille systems
were even more erratic in those parts
of the world.
"These were the circumstances
which in 1949 led Unesco to take up
the question of a single universal
script for the blind."
In 1954 Unesco published in English,
French and Spanish a standard work
by Sir Clutha Mackenzie entitled
"World Braille Usage". It was a land¬
mark for the blind of the world. In the
words of Helen Keller, the American
deaf-blind heroine who wrote the pre¬
face, it "lifted Braille from a jungle
of punctographic codes to a universal
medium." The possibility of producing
a new work outlining the latest
research and thinking on this sub¬
ject is now being studied.
HE wider aspects of Unes¬
co's work on the education of the
handicapped began to take more
concrete form as of 1966. The General
Conference of Unesco that year unani¬
mously adopted a resolution which in
a few clear sentences stressed the
need to promote collaboration among
educational research institutions in
studying the special problems of the
handicapped.
It emphasized the necessity to
exchange information internationally,
to establish educational research insti¬
tutions and to continue to publish
widely all information on educational
systems for the handicapped.
A special education programme was
launched by Unesco in 1968. Since
then, Unesco has been in liaison with
other international and also national
bodies working for the handicapped, äj
It is carrying out a global programme jl
for the publication of studies on the " '

deficient. It Is promoting co-operation
among nations by sending out special¬
ists and advisers on the education of
the handicapped, by granting fellow¬
ships for teacher-training and by acting
as the channel through which much
needed equipment for the handicapped
Is provided: Since 1968 some
100 projects in special education have
been launched In some 50 countries,
often financed through voluntary
contributions.
For instance, the Danish Government
organized in 1968 a Unesco training
seminar for teachers of the handi¬
capped in African countries and in
1969 it did the same for Arab teachers
of the blind. A year later a Unesco
six weeks' course for teachers of the
blind, financed partly by a gift of
$10,000 from Denmark, and partly by
Tanzania, took place at Tabora in
western Tanzania. The participants
learned the best methods of teaching
Braille In Swahili and English. The
funds also made it possible to pur¬
chase Braille frames, typewriters and
other equipment.
The Netherlands Government has
given fellowships to four of the Tanza-
nian teachers to study the education
of the blind and of the deaf in the
Netherlands. Travel costs were met
from Unesco's Special Education
Voluntary Contribution Fund. Similar
fellowships have been granted to
administrators and teachers of the
handicapped in some other countries
of Africa and of Asia.
u

NESCO'S Special Education
Voluntary Contribution Fund, set up in
1968, has so far received a total of
$62,600. Support has come from the
governments of Cambodia ($1,000),
Denmark ($10,000), Finland ($10,000),
Ghana ($500), India ($6,000), Iran
($3,000), Israel ($1 ,000), Malta ($ 500),
Morocco ($2,000), Norway ($10,000),
Sweden ($10,000), Yugoslavia ($500),
from Her Majesty the Empress of Iran
($2,000), from the Sovereign Order of
Malta ($6,000) and a smaller amount
from Danish and French donators.
Unesco has used this aid to sponsor
projects in Costa Rica (seminar on
education for the mentally retarded),
Cuba (training course for teachers of
the partially sighted), Arab Republic of
Egypt (fellowship to study the pro¬
duction of educational equipment for
the handicapped), Ethiopia (equipment
for the blind), Ghana (fellowship in
planning special education), Indonesia
(fellowship In speech-correction), Iran
(planning education of the mentally
retarded), Iraq (training of teachers
for the mentally retarded), Liberia
(teaching equipment for the deaf).
Sierra Leone (fellowship in education
of the physically handicapped), Tanza¬
nia (training course for teachers of the
blind and fellowships in education of
the blind and the deaf), and Venezuela
(training of teachers for the mentally
retarded).
In response to requests from its
member countries, Unesco has sent
out consultants to all parts of the
world. For, example a consultant
mission was sent to Guatemala for
three months to advise on the develop¬
ment of special education In all
Central American countries and Pana¬
ma. A consultant was sent to Syria
to assist in organizing a training
course for teachers of the deaf. A
Swiss specialist went to Madagascar
to direct a seminar for teachers of the
deaf from that country, Reunion and
Mauritius. His mission has resulted
in continuous contact between the
deaf communities in Madagascar and
Geneva.
At present contributions for helping
the handicapped are also being
channelled to some 20 developing
countries through Unesco's ingenious
Gift Coupon Programme. Groups and
institutiona in these countries are
purchasing with the coupons, teaching
equipment from hard currency nations.
Gift coupons are a form of inter¬
national cheque or money order issued
by Unesco. Donors purchase them
from Unesco headquarters in Paris
and send them to groups in other
countries which use them for buying
books and equipment for approved
projects from suppliers in any part of
the world. The suppliers send the
coupons back to Unesco to have them
converted into their own currency.
One of the recent Unesco gift
coupon campaigns was conducted by
the World Association of Girl Guides-
and Girl Scouts In an appeal to its
members to support a school for dis¬
abled girls being set up by the Nige¬
rian Girl Guides Association in Lagos.
Gift coupons are also being put to
good use In Mexico City, contributing
to the purchase of the most modern
equipment by the Escuela Normal de
Especialización, which promotes train¬
ing of teachers for the deaf, the blind
and the physically or mentally handi¬
capped. The teachers trained at the
college will then train others to
educate handicapped children through¬
out Latin America. In Ghana the cou¬
pons have enabled the director of the
Training College for Teachers of the
Deaf to buy group amplifiers and
hearing aids from Europe and America.
In 1972 Unesco set up a special
"Books for the Blind" programme in
co-operation with the World Council
for the Welfare of the Blind. This led
to one of the most successful fund-
raising ventures for the handicapped.
A gala performance jointly sponsored
by Unesco and the United States Na¬
tional Commission for Unesco was
given in Paris by the internationally
famous American singer and enter¬
tainer, Sammy Davis Jr. The $35,000
raised by the benefit performance went
to provide Braille books and educa¬
tional material for the blind. Among
the countries which have already be¬
nefited are Cyprus, Ghana, Iran, Mali,
Mexico and the Syrian Arab Republic.
THE RI6HTS
OF THE
MENTALLY RETARDED
The UnitedNations General Assembl,
on December 20. 1971. proclaimed the
rights of mentally retarded persons
and called for national and internatio¬
nal action for the protection of these
rights.
The U.N. Declaration on the Rights
ofMentally Retarded Persons affirms,
in part :
1. The mentally retarded person has, to
the maximum degree of feasibility, the
same rights as other human beings.
2. The mentally retarded person has a
right to proper medical care and physical
therapy and to such education, training,
rehabilitation and guidance as will enable
him to develop his ability and maximum
potential.
3. The mentally retarded person has a
right to economic security and to a decent
standard of living. He has a right to per¬
form productive work or to engage in
any other meaningful occupation to the
fullest possible extent of his capabilities.
4. Whenever possible, the mentally re¬
tarded person should live with his own
family or with foster parents and par¬
ticipate in different forms of community
life. The family with which he lives
should receive assis. anee. If care in an
institution becomes necessary, it should
be provided in surroundings and other
circumstances as close as possible to
those of normal life.
5. The mentally retarded person has a
right to a qualified guardian when this is
required to protect his personal well-being
and interests.
6. The mentally retarded person has a
right to protection from exploitation, abuse
and degrading treatment
Education is mainly a national but
also an international responsibility.
This applies equally to special edu¬
cation for the handicapped. The
serious situation of the world's handi¬
capped is best shown by quoting
U Thant, then Secretary-General of the
United Nations, when he spoke in New
York on October 20, 1971: "While so
much has been done, so much more
needs be done to help those 300 mil¬
lion disabled persons in the develop¬
ing world in their struggle to overcome
their handicaps and become active,
useful members of society. If 'we
break down to a per capita figure the
total sum being spent by the United
Nations system on rehabilitation, and
include all other International support,
governmental and voluntary, the figure
amounts to only one cent for each
disabled person, or a total annual
expenditure of $3 million on the
disabled in the developing world."

### 50231: New vistas in special education

NEW VISTAS IN SPECIAL EDUCATION
(Continued from page 17)
learners, remedial instruction is now
given outside the class in additional
or substitute courses, but the pupils
remain in their ordinary classes.
In the U.S.S.R., however, Increasing
emphasis is placed on the system of
special schools and classes. Special
programmes are carried out for each
type and degree of handicap.
Pre-school establishments for sev¬
erely handicapped children are show¬
ing very promising results. Before
decisions about placing a child In a
special school are taken each child
is examined by a committee compris¬
ing the director of the special school,
a school inspector, a pediatrician, a
neurologist, a teacher from an ordinary
school, and a teacher from a special
school. Thus the rights of the child
to appropriate educational measures
are well safeguarded.
In the U.S.A. a great amount of
research has been carried out on the
various ways of educating the han¬
dicapped. This has frequently resulted
in conflicting findings. The discrepan¬
cies in themselves merely show the
complexity of the subject and how
much we still have to learn. Follow-up
studies are likely to indicate the extent
to which early remedial action can
Improve the Intellectual growth In
children who might otherwise have
been mentally retarded.
In Uruguay early identification of
mental handicaps js regarded as of
vital importance, but this is considered
of little avail without immediate follow-
up remedial measures. The Latin Amer¬
ican Perinatology and Human Devel¬
opment Centre (handling the problems
of infants and children) therefore pro¬
vides courses for obstetricians, pedia¬
tricians, teachers and public-health
specialists.
The outcome of these courses
should offer a greater chance for early
treatment of infants whose mental de¬
velopment appears doubtful, and for
helping the mother and her new-born
child. Doctors, nurses and teachers are
alerted to physical factors, social con¬
ditions and family relationships which
can have a good or bad influence on
intellectual growth.
An outstanding landmark was the
adoption by the United Nations In 1971
of the Declaration on the Rights of
Mentally Retarded Persons which had
been earlier proclaimed by the Inter¬
national League of Societies for the
Mentally Handicapped.
The Declaration is an unequivocal
acceptance of the principle of integra¬
tion for the mentally handicapped. It is
also a declaration of intent to ensure
that the 1970s will see an end to the
policies of segregation or even the
public neglect which characterized
attitudes to the mentally handicapped
in too many places.
Initial handicaps do
not on their own
retard development.
They are always re¬
inforced by other
factors and by sec¬
ondary defects. Thus, a belief that
the handicapped cannot learn leads to
lack of stimulation and of opportunities
for learning. A feeling of shame or
the hostility of others can exclude the
handicapped from normal opportunities
for social development. But the term
"multiple handicap" generally refers to
a combination of two or more primary
handicaps, for instance "blind and
mentally handicapped" or "deaf and
emotionally disturbed".
In the past, teachers have been
trained to specialize in only one handi¬
cap, so it Is difficult to find people who
can meet all the needs of those suffer¬
ing from multiple handicaps. Since, in
a certain sense, all handicapped per¬
sons suffer from multiple handicaps this
has led many to reconsider not only
the traditional special teacher-training
programmes but also organization of
services for the handicapped.
Our inability to deal effectively with
those who are worst off may lead to
a clearer conception of what is best
for all the handicapped. In fact the
selection, training and professional
qualifications of those who deal with
the handicapped may become the
major focus of research in this decade.
One of the characteristic features
of the past decade has been the exten¬
sion of scientific knowledge to the
extent that a new science the science
of knowledge utilization has devel¬
oped. This embraces the collection,
analysis, dissemination and utilization
of research findings.
Studies of the effects of different
types of early environments, of the
development of language and of its
effects on intelligence, and of the unin¬
tentional side-effects of many of our
educational structures have neces¬
sitated reconsideration of the social
processes through which handicapped
children are obliged to pass and of
the possibilities for growth In human
intelligence.
Some of the significant principles
which have emerged and are effecting
changes in educational practice are:
The earlier we recognize handicaps
and the sooner we start remedial
action, the better the chances of
influencing a child's future develop¬
ment. Pre-school programmes have
been set up for all types of handicaps
to compensate for initial defects and
to prevent the growth of secondary
defects.
Intelligence levels are not now as¬
sumed to be as constant as many have
hitherto supposed. Theories which
maintain that a child's mental abilities
cannot be Improved have been called
in question by recent research projects.
These demonstrate how plastic and
modifiable intelligence is and how
much it depends on experiences parti¬
cularly In early life: ways of bringing
up children, what parents expect of
them, the frustrations or deprivations
children may feel, how the children's
actions affect parents' behaviour and
vice-versa, as well as many other
complex variables.
The results of intelligence tests,
especially with the young and handi¬
capped, have little value for predicting
how a child will develop intellectually
In the future. Hence the results of
IQ tests are useful In determining a
child's mental make-up at a given
moment but should not be used to
separate children Into rigid, permanent
mental categories.
For the best development, handi¬
capped children need many educators.
Parents, with guidance from special
teachers, can become useful auxiliaries
in the more formal aspects of early
education. Perhaps the modification
and changing of child-rearing practices
and the attitudes of parents of the
handicapped will become one of the
most important objectives of special
education in the next decade.
Education is a community resource
in part delegated to teachers. All
members of the community can help
in establishing satisfactory patterns of
life for the handicapped. The setting
in which learning takes place has a
profound effect on the learner and if
handicapped children are sent to iso¬
lated institutions it is no surprise that
they become "institutionalized". New
arrangements are being tried to see
how best "normalization" and "inte¬
gration" can be effected for the handi¬
capped.
To accomplish the aims of special
education the teacher must remain
informed and keep an open mind. He
must be prepared at all times to
examine the efficacy of his teaching
methods and to analyze those factors
outside the classroom which can best
enhance the lives and promote the
development of his pupils. Hence a
body of well-trained teachers is likely
to become the most effective profes- f»
sional instrument in helping many \<
handicapped children towards a more *»**

### 50236: Abolishing the ghettos for disabled citizens; physical and social barriers still prevent the total integration of the handicapped in society

ABOLISHING THE GHETTOS
FOR DISABLED CITIZENS
Continued from page 26
The importance of community in¬
volvement also emerges from the
requirement that special education,
even more than general education,
should be designed to help prepare
the handicapped child to live a useful
life in his community and society.
This means that the training must
not be In isolation, but in an atmo¬
sphere of interaction between the
people of the school, teachers, pupils
and parents, and the other people of
the community. It means that the
curriculum must be planned with the
characteristics of the community in
mind and with opportunities to observe
and participate in its work and play.
All of this can be accomplished only
when the organizations and individuals
of the community are effectively
associated with the special education
programme.
In any discussion of the relationships
between special education and the
community a central issue is the
respective functions of special schooîù
for the handicapped and of provisions
for participation of the handicapped
in regular schools. There is a role for
each, but greater emphasis can be
placed on the Integration of disabled
students In general educational facili¬
ties.
Dr. Herbert Goldstein, of Yeshiva
University in New York, Chairman of
the Rehabilitation International Edu¬
cation Commission, says, "The concept
of normalization as it applies to the
education of handicapped children
underscores the role of the community
as it never has before. Historically,
it has been the practice to exclude the
handicapped from the benefits of com¬
munity life and participation by sending
them off to special schools or insti¬
tutions far from community life.
"Explicitly, the rationale for thus
segregating the handicapped by their
handicaps, i.e., by building and activat¬
ing special schools for blind and for
deaf children, was to provide an
educational setting that would be
advantageous for their living and edu¬
cation. It was felt that they could get
along better and profit more from an
environment designed to accommodate
their handicapping condition...
"Implicity, however, the motivation
to segregate handicapped children
was, and often still is, based on their
'differentness'; they sometimes don't
look and act like ordinary children and

### 50236: Abolishing the ghettos for disabled citizens; physical and social barriers still prevent the total integration of the handicapped in society

thereby make for feelings of discomfort
and anxiety in members of the com¬
munity (see article page 15).
"Normalization in education does not
mean providing handicapped children
with exactly the same kind of education
and educational facilities available to
normal children; this would only make
the handicapping condition more pro¬
minent. Instead, normalization in edu¬
cation means that educational pro¬
visions are such that the handicapped
child is given the same opportunity to
realize his potentialities as is given
normal children.
"In some instances, very minor
changes in the school building ramps,
so that they can get into the school
building, for example, is all that some
physically handicapped children need.
Once in the building, they are compe¬
tent in all other ways so that they can
capitalize on the school offerings.
Other children require more complex
adaptations In order to minimize the
impact of their handicap on learning
and social Interactive conditions In the
school."
An understanding of the educational,
as well as of any of the other problems
of physical or mental disability must be
based on the knowledge that many of
these problems are created or made
more damaging by society and by its
attitudes.
Historically, we have stigmatized
those who are different and excluded
them from the so-called normal life of
our communities. We have built our
buildings and our cities in ways that
exclude people with limited mobility.
We have not yet learned to regard
people in terms of their abilities, rather
than of their disabilities when those
exist In the stigmatized forms. We
have created educational, vocational
and social ghettos in which our dis¬
abled citizens are supposed to live and
learn and work.
Special education Is designed to
help handicapped individuals in making
the fullest use of their capabilities, but
it cannot succeed without the under¬
standing and the support of the com¬
munity in which it is placed. It cannot
finally succeed until society has done
its part in eliminating the physical and
social barriers it erects in the paths of
our disabled citizens.

Crutches and all, Rafik IMesanov plunges lustily into the water. Undaunted by the polio
which paralyzed him when he was only one year old, he now lives a normal life thanks
to the rehabilitation efforts of the Special Sanatorium for Children at Eupatoria on the
Black Sea coast not far from Sebastapol (U.S.S.R.). Countless polio victims all over the
world have learned to win a physical and psychological victory over their handicaps thanks
to modern educational and therapeutic methods.
