Few traces of ancient civilizations were found at Santarem, on the Tapajoz river
in the Brazilian Amazon basin, until 1922 when a cloudburst washed out the streets
of the city and uncovered stone tools and a great quantity of pottery. Since then,
excavations at many sites along the Tapajoz have revealed pottery that has been
called "perhaps the most remarkable in the Amazon Valley." Santarem pottery
is notable for its unusual shapes and profusion of bird and animal ornaments
modelled in the round as well as decorative patterns and designs, incised and in
relief. Seated figurine, dating back to about 1200 A.D. is one of the striking pieces
of pottery found near Santarem. Human heads, whether figurines or decorations
applied to vessels, are often shown with headdresses resembling a diadem and
ears depicted by a double prominence, as here, and eyes shaped like coffee beans.

THE THREAT TO PRIVACY
This year is the 25th anniversary of
the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights. Meeting in Paris, on December
10th 1948, the United Nations General
Assembly adopted the 30 articles of the
Declaration. On December 16, 1966,
the General Assembly unanimously
adopted two covenants designed to give
the Declaration the force of international
law: one covering economic, social and
cultural rights and the other dealing
with civil and political rights. The two
covenants have not yet received the
necessary number of ratifications to
enter into force. This issue of the
"Unesco Courier" is devoted in large
part to the right to privacy, a basic
human right guaranteed by several
articles of the Declaration.

HUMAN RIGHTS
AND THE THREAT
TO PRIVACY
This year marks the 25th anniversary of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights adopted in Paris in 1948. In January 1973, the
Secretary-General of the United Nations presented to the U.N.
Commission on Human Rights the results of a global inquiry on
"Human Rights and Scientific and Technological Development".
The inquiry was carried out in response to a request from the
General Assembly of the United Nations in 1968, following concern
on this subject expressed at the International Conference on Human
Rights meeting in Teheran earlier that year. "While recent scientific
development and technological advances have opened vast prospects
for economic, cultural and social progress ", the Teheran conference
said, "such developments may nevertheless endanger the rights
and freedoms of individuals and will require continuing attention."
The protection of privacy in the face of threats posed by modern
technology has also preoccupied Unesco for many years. Unesco's
General Conference examined the problem in 1968 and Unesco
has since carried out a series of international inquiries and studies
in this field. On the following pages we reproduce salient passages
from the Secretary-General's report to the U.N. Commission on
Human Rights (pages 4-15) as well as from a recent Unesco study
on the Right to Privacy (page 16).

M OR about two decades,
steadily increasing concern has been
expressed as to the feasibility of pro¬
tecting the privacy of the individual
in the light of rapid advances in
recording and other techniques that
make it relatively easy for a person
to be heard and seen, to have his
voice recorded and his picture filmed,
without his being aware of it, both in
public places and in places which he
has reason to believe are secluded.
These advances are due largely to
developments in the field of elec¬
tronics (in particular, the invention of
the transistor), optics
and the miniaturization

Similar concern has been express¬
ed about the technologically unrelated
but contemporaneous development of
the invasion of privacy by psycho¬
logical and physical testing methods
that are being utilized for non-medical
purposes.
The benefits which scientific know¬
ledge and its application through
technology have brought to mankind
are immense, in terms of the liberation
of the mind and an enhanced under¬
standing by man of himself and of the
universe surrounding him and in terms
of the improvement of man's physical
well-being. The United Nations and
its specialized agencies, and notably
Unesco, are concentrating much of
their effort on programmes which
encourage and support the application
of scientific knowledge and technology
to the betterment of human life.
During the nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries scientific advance

was widely assumed to be inevitably
favourable to human progress, and no
essential conflict was generally en¬
visaged between the two. Subsequent
events, however in particular the
devastation caused by two world wars,
which was made possible to a great
extent by scientific and technological
developments have raised doubts as
to the existence of such an Inevitable
alliance between scientific advance
and human progress.
More specifically there has been a
growing realization that, whereas scien¬
tific knowledge by itself may well be
neutral, much of it can be applied
in ways that are harmful to humanity.
The question of the impact of recent
scientific and technological develop¬
ments on human rights was brought
before the United Nations as the
result of an initiative taken in 1968 by
the International Conference on Human
Rights, convened at Teheran, Iran.
The Conference adopted a Procla¬
mation on Human Rights which point¬
ed out, among other things, that while
recent scientific discoveries and tech¬
nological advances have opened vast
prospects for economic, social and
cultural progress, such developments
might nevertheless endanger the rights
and freedoms of individuals and would
require continuing attention.
The Conference, more specifically,
recommended that the organizations
of the United Nations family should
undertake a study of the problems
with respect to human rights arising
from developments in science and
technology, particularly with regard to
certain specified topics.
Later in 1968, on December 19, the
United Nations General Assembly
adopted a resolution on human rights
and scientific and technological dev¬
elopments in which, sharing the concern
expressed by the Teheran Conference,
it endorsed the idea that these prob¬
lems required thorough and con¬
tinuous national and international inter¬
disciplinary studies which might serve
as a basis for drawing up appropriate
standards to protect human rights and
fundamental freedoms.
The resolution invited the Secretary-
General of the United Nations to under¬
take, notably with the assistance of
the U.N. Advisory Committee on the
Application of Science and Technology
to Development, and in co-operation
with the competent specialized agen¬
cies, a study of the problems in
connexion with human rights arising
from developments in science and
technology, in particular from the
following standpoints:
' Respect for the privacy of indivi¬
duals and the integrity and sovereignty
of nations in the light of advances in
recording and other techniques;
' Protection of the human persona¬
lity and its physical and. intellectual
integrity, in the light of advances in
biology, medicine and biochemistry;
Uses of electronics which may
affect the rights of the person and the
limits which should be placed on such
uses in a democratic society;
More generally, the balance which
should be established between scien¬
tific and technological progress and
the intellectual, spiritual, cultural and
moral advancement of humanity.

preliminary report of the U.N. Sec-

retary-General, the United Nations
Commission on Human Rights
recognized the need during the Second
United Nations Development Decade
to concentrate its attention on the most
important and basic problems of
protecting human rights and funda¬
mental freedoms in the context of
scientific and technological progress,
and in particular on:
Protection of human rights in the
economic, social and cultural fields in
accordance with the structure and
resources of States and the scientific
and technological level they have
reached, as well as protection of the
right to work in conditions of the auto¬
mation and mechanization of pro¬
duction;
The use of scientific and techno¬
logical developments to foster respect
for human rights and the legitimate
interests of other peoples and respect
for generally recognized moral stand¬
ards and standards of international
law; and
Prevention of the use of scientific
and technological achievements to
restrict fundamental democratic rights
and freedoms.
Requesting the Secretary-General to
continue his study, the Commission
called on governments to submit to
him material on problems concerning
the protection of human rights within
the context of scientific and techno¬
logical progress, including information
on the development of legislation,
court decisions and national practice,
and on any national projects dealing
with these questions.
It also called on a number of U.N.
specialized agencies to report on
problems relating to human rights
which fall within their competence, and
requested comments and observations
from intergovernmental and non¬
governmental organizations.
The U.N. Secretary-General request¬
ed further information for the study
from member states of the United
Nations and its specialized agencies,
particularly on laws, draft laws, im¬
plementing regulations, court decisions
and model codes relating to the
various devices and techniques affect-
inq the privacy of the individual, and
information regarding the protection
of the integrity and sovereignty of
nations in the light of advances in
recording and other techniques.
In all, 54 governments supplied
information for the U.N. study on
human rights and scientific and tech¬
nological developments. Some 15
governments stated that they had no
information, studies or comments to
forward. Reports were also received
from six specialized agencies: Inter¬
national Atomic Energy Agency, Inter¬
national Labour Organization, Interna¬
tional Telecommunication Union, Unes¬
co, Universal Postal Union and World
Health Organization.
Information was also supplied by
the Council of Europe, the League of
Arab States, the Organization for
Economic Co-operation and Develop
ment and the International Criminal
Police Organization. Nearly 40 non¬
governmental organizations, represent¬
ing a wide range of interests, co¬
operated in the study, as did many
other organizations, institutes and
individual researchers.
It should be made clear that most
of the new techniques employed in
invading the privacy of the individual
were not originally developed for that
purpose but were by-products of
research in other fields. This fact, and
the fact that many of them have
benign or beneficial uses, tend to add
to the difficulty of identifying and
controlling a host of new devices and
techniques that continue to be dev¬
eloped and that may be used to
invade the privacy of the individual.


### 51314: Three-pronged attack on private life

2. Three-pronged attack
on private life
HE invasions of individual
privacy made possible by the newly-
developed techniques are divided in
the U.N. study into three categories:
auditory and visual invasions, psy¬
chological and physical invasions, and
invasions by data surveillance.
The study deals, for example, with
the use of wire-taps, microphones,
transmitters and tape-recorders, and
telescopic lenses, candid cameras,
two-way mirrors and closed-circuit
television. With regard to the psy¬
chological and physical invasion of
privacy, it covers such matters as the
use for non-medical purposes of per¬
sonality tests, "lie-detectors", narco¬
analysis, and blood and breath tests.
There is a recognizable reciprocal
relationship between respect for the
privacy of the individual and the pro¬
tection of certain other human rights,
the effect being one of mutual re¬
inforcement. This interaction is not
new but has been receiving renewed
attention lately in view of the increased
opportunities for violations of privacy
afforded by recent scientific and tech¬
nological developments.
Among the rights which may be
affected by invasion of privacy is the
right of everyone to freedom of
opinion and expression proclaimed in
article 19 of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights and dealt with In
article 19 of the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights.
Two others are the right to freedom
of thought, conscience and religion
(article 18 of the Universal Declaration
and article 18 of the Covenant); and
the right to a fair and public hearing in
the determination of the individual's
rights and obligations and of any
criminal charge against him, including
various rights of the defendants in
penal proceedings (articles 10 and 11
of the Universal Declaration and arti¬
cles 14 and 15 of the Covenant).
Questions are being asked such as
whether invasion of privacy by means
of listening and recording devices or
of certain psychological and physical
tests in connexion with penal pro¬
ceedings do not, in fact, lead to
violations of existing guarantees
against self-incrimination, an aspect of
the right to a fair hearing, and
connected procedural guarantees dealt
with in the Universal Declaration and
the International Covenant.
Article 14 of the Covenant requires
that in the determination of any cri¬
minal charge against him, everyone
shall be entitled to certain minimum
guarantees, including "not to be
compelled to testify against himself
or to confess guilt".
Infringements upon privacy by
modern methods of auditory and visual
surveillance may also, under certain
circumstances, violate guarantees
against arbitrary interference with the
family, with the home, with the secrecy
of correspondence, in particular
through the tapping of telephone
conversations, and with guarantees
against attacks on one's honour and
reputation (article 12 of the Universal
Declaration and article 17 of the
Covenant).
The connexion existing between
the enjoyment of privacy and of other
human rights has been summarized as
follows:
Wholesale invasions of privacy
inhibit liberty, often purposely. This
is particularly true of surreptitious
invasions, like electronic eavesdrop¬
ping, spies, informers, entrappers, and
psychological testing, of the existence
of which the subject is often unaware
until too late. The community becomes
fear-ridden, and no one can be trusted,
whether he be family, friend or asso¬
ciate; indeed, a person may be led to
continual distrust of himself, as his
efforts at individual self-fulfilment
conflict with the norms of authority.
This destruction of trust is one of
the major dangers to a free society.

### 51315: The Walls etc... have electronic ears

This ordinary-looking wrist watch conceals
a tiny radio transmitter and telescopic
antenna (here extended fully). Such a
device can easily be used secretly to
pick up and transmit conversations. In
conjunction with an electronic robot
receiver, the transmitter could also serve
as a remote control switch to set a tape
recorder in motion. The growing micro¬
miniaturization of electronic equipment has
enormously Increased the danger of
eavesdropping with a host of devices.


3. The walls etc...
have electronic ears
'NE of the oldest among
the modern methods of auditory
surveillance is the wire-tap.
Such "direct taps" could take place
anywhere between the voice-piece of
the telephone and the main telephone
exchange. They interfered sometimes
with clear transmission, however, and
were subject to discovery by physical
inspection.
Describing the techniques of wire¬
tapping, in his book "Privacy and
Freedom" (New York, Atheneum,
1967), Alan F. Westin says that the
major innovation in wire-tapping
before 1941, and still the leading
technique, uses the induction coil.
By this technique an induction coil
is placed a few feet from the telephone
or near its various connecting wires
at any point before it is mixed with
other lines. This requires no cutting
or breaking into the telephone wires
or equipment. The coil, being in the
magnetic field carrying the voice
signal, draws off a very small amount
of that signal and carries it to a
receiver that permits the listening to
or recording of conversations.
In addition to their use as "planted"
devices, says Westin, induction coils
can also be uëed as portable devices
when kept in a pocket and wired to
a pocket recorder. In this way calls
have been tapped by investigators
sitting in waiting-rooms outside
business, law, and government offices,
from rooms adjoining those of hotel
guests, and even from the street
outside a building when a phone is
near the sidewalk.
Techniques are being developed in
several countries which make it
possible to identify persons speaking
on the telephone without reference to
the contents of the conversation.
Microphones may be used for
monitoring ordinary conversations,
not carried over telephone wires.
Some of these microphones require
external wire connexion to their source
of power, others work on internal
batteries. Some have to be introduced
into the premises where the conversa¬
tion takes place, others are able to
monitor from outside.
A simple microphone requires
positioning on the premises in ques-

tion, where it may be secretly left,
connected by wire to a loudspeaker
over which the conversations taking
place may be heard outside the
premises.
Micro-miniaturization has enabled
microphones to be reduced to the size
of a match-head. The transmission
range is from 300 feet to more than
a quarter of a mile. These tiny
mikes can be placed inside a
telephone, a flower-pot, a picture
frame or in any other object in the
room. A common practice is to tape
them to the underside of furniture.
No wires are required for the Fre¬
quency Modulation (FM) microphones
which have a built-in battery-operated
radio transmitter. They can give a
constant transmission for five days
with a 14 ounce battery.
Small devices exist which can be
worn on the person. For example,
magnetic microphones are on the
market weighing about 5 grammes,
which may be hidden behind the lapels
of a suit jacket. The diameter of the
mouthpiece, visible in the button¬
hole, measures 9 millimetres. It may
be connected to a pocket tape-
recorder or to a miniature transmitter.
This device and variations working on
the same general principle (such as
cuff-links and fountain pens containing
microphones are said to be widely
used.
'OME microphones do not
need to be placed inside the premises
in which the conversation takes place.
Directional microphones, for instance,
are able to pick up sounds from the
outside through any openings in a
room, such as open windows.
They may also be used to listen to
conversations held outdoors, for
example on park benches or in fields,
hundreds of feet away. Some direc¬
tional microphones are, moreover,
able to monitor sounds through closed
windows. They have a range of 40 to
50 metres.
Another type of microphone which
does not require trespassing on the
premises concerned is the contact-
microphone. This device, which may
be the size of a lima bean, can be
attached to the outside of the wall
of a room. When sound waves set up
by speech strike the wall, it picks up
enough of the vibration to permit
accurate recording.
Where the walls are too thick, a
variation on the contact-microphone,
a "spike-mike", may be used. The
vibrations in that case are transmitted
through "spikes" the size of a small
nail to contact-microphones and then
recorded.
Another instrument for recording
speech from a closed room is a device
that uses a reflector made of a thin
diaphragm and a microwave antenna.
The device is activated by a microwave
beam that goes through solid walls
and has a range of a city block. When
activated it sends the vibrations in the
room to an outside receiver and the
conversation is recorded.
"Micro-balles", i.e., microphone
bullets, may be shot at windows by
a special rifle, to catch sound of
speech from outside the window.
A technique exists for taking sound
out of rooms using laser microphones.
One such device is portable and sends
out an invisible infra-red beam, which
may travel for miles before reaching
the target room. The returning beam
having been modulated by the sound
waves in the room, a photo amplifier
at the listening post makes it possible
to transform the returning light into
sound.
Tape-recorders have been minia¬
turized and transistorized and are
capable of recording for several hours
without any need for changing the reel.
Some tape-recorders are self-activated
by sound and stop of themselves
when silence returns. Such devices,
may, for example, be built into
briefcases.
It has also been reported that a
dentist, while filling a tooth cavity,
may insert there a miniature micro¬
phone capable of transmitting every
word spoken by the person concerned
during the day, or a small transmitter
emitting a signal permitting an operator
in a distant room to follow closely the
person's movements all over a city;
and that miniature transmitters exist
which a person may swallow without
his knowledge.
Miniature transmitters may also be
placed inside a car, whence they emit
a signal which can be tracked by
portable receivers in other vehicles,
miles away.
Ordinary telephones may be trans¬
formed into transmitters by processes
requiring entry into the premises
concerned. One such telephone-
based transmitter, the "Harmonica
Bug", has been described by one
expert as follows:
"Once this is installed in the
telephone of the victim, the eaves¬
dropper, who can be anywhere, even
thousands of miles away provided
that he is on a direct dialing system,
merely dials the victim's number and
blows a predetermined musical note
on a harmonica. This note is picked
up by the device in the victim's
telephone, and prevents it from
ringing. At the same time it connects
the telephone microphone into the line
so that the eavesdropper can listen to
any conversations that are taking place
within earshot of the victim's
telephone."
The "internal telephone transmitter"
is a miniaturized transmitter that
resembles the microphone in the
mouthpiece of the telephone receiver,
for which it is substituted. It sends the
voice impulses created by the use
of the telephone to a transistorized FM
receiver, set at the device's transmis¬
sion frequency. The transmitter
receives its power from the telephone
line in question.
There exist small, unobtrusive
electronic devices to be worn or
implanted on one's person; these
devices emit signals permitting a
monitor located some distance away
to determine the wearer's location.
Existing technology is, moreover, able
to produce devices which can, in
addition, monitor such bodily reactions
as pulse rate and blood pressure as
well as the sounds in the wearer's
immediate surroundings, for example,
his conversations.
Another device for electronic sur¬
veillance permits a person within a
range of three or four city blocks to
learn whether a television set is
operating within a house and, if so,
to which channel it is tuned. Radar-
type equipment in a truck or nearby
building is able to pick up signals
known as horizontal oscillators, given
off by TV sets, compare them with
the particular signal produced for each
channel, and identify the one in use,
all within a fraction of a second. The
developers of this device, intended
for measuring television audience
choices, state that they are also able
to identify radio stations.


### 51335: The Silent sweep of hidden eyes

4. The silent
sweep
of hidden
eyes
ECHNIQUES for visual
surveillance are based on the use of
devices for viewing and devices for
recording pictures.
Devices for viewing include instru¬
ments as diverse as miniature
appliances containing a lens that can
be used for secretly observing the
occupants of a room by inserting it
into a hole drilled through a wall;
polaroid and other types of one-way
windows behind which people can sit
and watch what is happening in
another room without the occupants
being aware; and powerful telescopes
that make it possible to observe loca¬
tions in which persons have reason
to assume they are secluded from
public view.
For recording pictures, still and

## [Page 9](074890engo.pdf#page=9) 0

### 51335: The Silent sweep of hidden eyes

movie cameras have been miniaturized
and can be installed on premises or
hidden on the user in ways that make
detection difficult.
Miniature still cameras hidden in a
room can be pre-set to take pictures
at periodic intervals or to be triggered
in various ways, by a switch being
turned on, a file drawer being opened,
or a person entering the room.
Telescopic lenses make it possible
to photograph small objects from great
distances. Small telescopic devices
exist, measuring 20 cm., which are
able to photograph a typewritten page
at a distance of a hundred metres.
Light intensifiers, used with or
without cameras, provide normal vision
in poor daylight or moonlight, and
acceptable vision on an overcast,
moonless night; and image stabilizers
allow sharp pictures to be obtained
from helicopters or by hand (even
while the person with the camera is
walking around).
Television techniques may be used
both for viewing and for recording.
For viewing alone, so-called "live"
transmissions are used, in the form
of closed-circuit television.
Television "eyes" of very small
dimensions (8 x 23 cm.) can be
hidden in a room whence they can
send pictures to a receiver a block
or two away. "Optical fibres" to
which a lens is attached can bend
light around corners. This makes it
possible to place only the optical fibre
and lens in the room under surveillance
and to install the TV camera itself
elsewhere. Moreover, TV cameras
are available which are small enough
to fit into a coat pocket and have
an "eye" the width of a cigarette.
'EVELOPMENT of television
tape makes possible the recording
and replaying of televised situations
and events.
The use of infra-red light makes it
possible to observe and to take
pictures in the dark, since concealed
cameras equipped with infra-red film
can photograph actions in a dark room
if an invisible infra-red energy source
has been placed within that room.
This can be done by putting special
bulbs in overhead fixtures or lamps.
To the naked eye the bulb seems to
be unlit, since no visible light is
transmitted; but it is actually flooding
the room with infra-red light and will
provide the basis for clear snapshots
or films. If the windows are bare,
cameras outside the premises can
photograph inside by projecting infra¬
red illumination into the room.
Substances exist which have the
appearance of solid wall panels and
which do not permit the passage of
normal light but do transmit infra-red
light. The source of infra-red light
need not be inside the room but may
be supplied by a beam sent from the
observation post.
A miniature device has been placed
on the market which combines the
television camera with a transmitter.
It can transmit the pictures it takes
and can operate in darkness with
the use of an infra-red system.
Modern technology makes it possible
to pass visible light or "infra-red
energy" through sealed envelopes and
to take pictures. These pictures can
then be read or, more properly,
deciphered by persons skilled in
reading handwriting or typing where
lines are inverted and superimposed.
Also available today is a needle-thin
"flashlight" that can be inserted in a
sealed envelope to "light it up" for
quick reading by a trained investigator.
Optical "scanners" have been
developed, capable of scanning and
recording typed or hand-printed letters,
words and numbers at the rate of
840 single-spaced, typewritten pages
per hour. These "scanners" can be
used to establish an automated "mail
cover" to record systematically the
names, addresses, etc., of persons
sending mail to a particular individual.
Such information, too, may be
forwarded to a computer for storage
and analysis.
Fluorescent powders or dyes have
been produced which are applied
secretly to a person's hands, shoes,
clothing, hair, umbrella, and the like,
or can be added to such items as
soap, after-shave lotion, and hair tonic
which an individual applies to himself.
Although these substances are
invisible under regular light, they
register as "glowing" substances on
the person being followed when he is
illuminated by an ultra-violet light
source carried by the investigator.
A method of thermal detection that
can be used to establish the recent
presence of persons has been des¬
cribed as follows:
Nearly all moving bodies or warm¬
blooded animals contain a source of
motive power that inevitably develops
heat as well as motion. It is thus
possible to detect automobiles, tanks,
ships, aircraft, and human beings, by
the heat they radiate. As a result of 0
World War II and the subsequent **
development of guided missiles,
thermal detectors can now be made

very sensitive, and capable of giving
pictures of a scene in which the hotter
objects show up more brightly than
the cooler ones.
The exposed portions of the human
body radiate more heat than those that
are clothed, and thus show up as
"whiter". At the same time, the
sensitivity of the thermal detector can
be made so great that even a surface
that is one thousandth of a degree
centigrade above its surroundings
will show up relative to these sur¬
roundings.
It is thus even possible to discover
where a person has recently been
sitting or lying, because his body has
warmed the surface underneath, and
this takes some minutes to cool down
after he has left it . . . but the amount
of information that can be obtained in
this way is very limited.
An aerial hovering device has been
developed which may combine viewing
and listening. This is a unit with two
counter-rotating rotor blades which is
sent to hover aloft, attached by cable
to ground-control equipment. About
three to four feet in diameter and
weighing forty to fifty pounds, the
surveillance unit now carries closed-
circuit TV equipment that transmits
pictures of objects at ranges of one
mile or more. It could carry listening
equipment just as easily. The unit
hovers at altitudes of 100 to 2,000 feet
and rotates 360- degrees for tracking
purposes.
These systems are not difficult to
operate and allow someone, as Alan F.
Westin points out in "Privacy and
Freedom", "to watch, photograph, and
listen to activity within a mile or more
of his own property, without ever
entering the physical air space of his
neighbours."

Clandestin
In January 1970, Unesco organized an international
meeting on the right to privacy. One of the
participants, Pierre Juvigny, jurist and member of
of the French Conseil d'Etat, andauthor of a special
paper presented to the meeting, " The Right to
Privacy in the Modern World ", summarized the
basic problems involved in the misuse of new
recording techniques as follows :
factor which is typical of all these modern recording
devices is their clandestine use, whether they are a telephoto lens,
wire-tapping and telephone espionage, polaroid glasses and perhaps,
before long, mini-equipment which may make possible the surveillance or
even the control of the behaviour of an individual at any time and without
his knowledge. . .
Such utilization of these different devices by the public authorities raises
many legal problems. Even though, in many countries, courts and tribunals
usually refuse to accept as evidence information obtained in this manner
particularly as the possibility of altering an authentic recording cannot be
ruled out studies should first be made of whether it is lawful or unlawful
to make such recordings and use them in the legal sphere.
The danger is obvious when these procedures are used by State bodies
which are usually beyond the parliamentary, jurisdictional, administrative
or other controls to which the public services are usually -subject. In a
world where there are parallel, unofficial and even clandestine organizations
side by side in the spheres of the police, information and surveillance . . . ,
it is obvious that these services could use such recordings as a weapon
for pressure and blackmail that could interfere with the legislative,
executive and judicial aspects of the operation of any democratic society.
The danger does not come only from State bodies. The general use
of recording devices opens up possibilities of private espionage by means
which have nothing in common with the rudimentary techniques once
used by jealous husbands, gossips, and inquisitive janitors, Such
interference can take place in the building in which the family lives. In
some cases, one member of the family may be spying on another member
of the same family (seeking grounds for divorce, for instance).
In the commercial, technical and financial fields, competing companies
can spy on each other, and not only on each other; private espionage
can be used also within the company itself (secret recordings, for instance,
of the conversations of the heads of departments made by the president
or the managing director of the firm); in such cases, although there is no
question of "private life", questions of private law do arise.
Businesses in the field of information can be tempted all the more
easily by the immense possibilities of these clandestine recording tech¬
niques because they have long been accustomed to using all the audio¬
visual techniques.

### 51339: Lawless frontiers of modern technology

Closed-circuit television is being
used, among many other purposes, to
relay lectures to additional class¬
rooms; to survey stores with high
shoplifting records and to guard
warehouses at night; or to help protect
tenants in apartment house lobbies
and elevators and riders on subways
from assaults and robberies.
Some techniques have been found
to be of great use in the field of medi¬
cine. Thus the principle of the "optical
fibre", which makes it possible to
transmit images along bent and curved
paths, may be applied for use in sur¬
gery. The modern nursing technique
of "intensive care" is dependent on
electronic systems of remote sur¬
veillance and the recording of vital
processes.
Closed-circuit television is also an
important tool in certain radiological
techniques and in the education of
members of health teams. The obser¬
vation of mentally disordered patients
is facilitated by the use of polaroid
glass windows in wards or recreation
rooms. It has been stressed that when
applied in the health and medical fields
these techniques and devices have as
their objective the good of the indivi¬
dual and that any invasion of his pri¬
vacy is an incidental by-product.
It has also been pointed out that
criminals have at their disposal the
products of modern science and
technology, including the moden media
of rapid communication and trans¬
portation, which enable them to plan
and carry out their schemes more
swiftly, over larger areas and less
conspicuously than previously; and
that, correspondingly, the law-enforce¬
ment agencies also need to avail
themselves of modern techniques to
be able to fight crime. Surveillance
devices are known to be used in the
interests of national security.
Despite the harmless and beneficial
uses which exist for modern methods
of surveillance, such methods ob¬
viously can be used equally well in
ways which threaten, or create
problems for, the privacy of the indi¬
vidual Many of the new surveillance
devices are relatively low in price,
easy to obtain or to put together from
components, simple to install or use,
cheap to operate or hard to detect, or
may combine various of these charac¬
teristics.
It appears that not only govern¬
ments but also private individuals are
availing themselves of the new sur¬
veillance technology to an increasing
extent and in a variety of contexts.
In "The Problem of Privacy in the
Year 2000" (Daedalus, Journal of the
American Academy of Arts and Scien¬
ces, Summer 1967), Harry Kalven, Jr.,
points out in this connexion that :
"Soon intrusions will not be limited
to government measures in aid of law
enforcement or national security. The
technology may become a common¬
place in the hands of private parties
employers interested in the off-
hours activities of employees, com¬
petitors interested in one another's
integrity and trade secrets, estranged
spouses interested in perfecting
grounds for divorce, insurance com¬
panies interested in the subsequent
health of personal injury claimants
they have paid, and the idly curious
who are just interested."
Examples exist of traditional situa¬
tions in which traditional methods of
supervision or surveillance by persons
are even now being replaced at times
by technical devices. Such methods
include the surveillance by means of
microphones or closed-circuit televi¬
sion of students and teachers in class¬
rooms, and of employees in places of
work, such as factories and stores.
The resulting transmissions may or
may not be recorded on tape. They
make it possible, depending on the
technique chosen, to monitor and to
record every gesture, facial expression
or remark, every minor lapse or every 4
confidential exchange of views bet- | |

### 51341: New techniques for probing the mind

Drawing by Asdrubal Salsamendi - Unesco
iECENT decades have seen
the invention or development of var¬
ious techniques of eliciting informa¬
tion from individuals by psychological
and physical means such as person¬
ality assessment techniques ("person¬
ality tests"), polygraphs ("lie detec¬
tors"), narco-analysis and certain
bodily tests, the use of which may
involve invasions of the privacy of the
individual.
It should be kept in mind in this
connexion that many of these tech¬
niques and devices have medical uses
and when applied in the health and
medical fields have as their exclusive
objective the good of the person
concerned, any invasion of his pri¬
vacy being an incidental by-product.
The new techniques available range
from those concerned with psycho¬
logical reactions alone, through tech¬
niques taking into account the physical
effects of a person's psychological
reactions or the psychological effects
of his physical reactions, to techniques
measuring physical condition only.
One type of assessment is that
employing psycho-physiological
indices, such as cardiac (heartbeat)
deceleration, pupil contraction, and
electrical conductivity of the skin
produced by sweating. These
approaches are used to identify
transitory states of the personality,
such as guilt, anxiety, interest, stress
and emotional ambivalence. The most
important application of this type from
a human rights standpoint is in the
"lie detector" test.
The "lie detector" procedure
consists in the person under exami¬
nation being asked a series of ques¬
tions by the polygraph operator. The
bodily changes accompanying the
verbal replies are registered by the
instrument and translated by pens
into patterns on graph paper, resem¬
bling those of an electrocardiogram.
Certain variations in bodily reactions
to different questions some relevant
and some irrelevant to the subject-
matter under investigation are inter¬
preted, broadly speaking, as reflecting
stress engendered by the need for
telling an untruth.
An example of psycho-physiological
personality assessment is a technique
that purports to reveal "private atti¬
tudes about public things and
persons". This approach examines
changes in the contraction or dilation
of the pupil of the eye when the person
concerned is presented with pictures.
In one study, for instance, pictures
of leading political figures were used.
This study reports that one out of
three of those professing preference
for one of two major candidates in a
political campaign actually preferred
the other candidate, preference being
indicated by pupil dilation for pre¬
ferred candidates and pupil contrac¬
tion for disapproved candidates. Work
has been done on reactions to verbal
materials as well.
This technique also has been used
to indicate the advertizing effective¬
ness of pictorial material. Current
technology usually employs cameras
with the assessee's head held in a
fixed position.
Personality assessment techniques
are used in particular in connexion
with psychological research, guidance,
educational and vocational counselling,
and personnel selection and adminis¬
tration.
When used for guidance purposes,
they are intended to enable the in¬
dividual concerned to gain insight into
his own personality. In connexion
with educational and career counsel¬
ling, they are used with a view to
facilitating the selection of the type
of education or occupation which
would enable the person in question
to make the most of his aptitudes.
In personnel administration such
assessment techniques are used with
a view to facilitating the selection of
the most qualified and suitable can¬
didates for the posts in question,
both for initial recruitment and sub¬
sequent promotion. It is considered,
however, that the predictive value of
such tests varies considerably, de¬
pending on their nature and on the
specific use to which they are being
put.
The original motivation in attempting
to apply scientific methods to the
various procedures mentioned above
has been the search for objective
criteria, untainted by personal pre¬
judice or human error, be it in the
choice of a career, the selection of
a person for a given job or the search
for an offender.

given in each case by a judicial authority.
States permitting the operations of private detectives
shall license such detectives individually.
States shall favour the estiblishment of journalists'
codes of ethics including provisions concerning respect for

In addition to any possible criminal liability, civil liability

device in relation to a person, under circumstances which
would entitle him to assume that he could not be seen or
heard by unauthorized persons, or the unauthorized
disclosure of information so gained.

cessation of acts thus violating his privacy and, where the
act has been completed, to recover damages, including
damages for non-pecuniary injury.

control effectively the importation, manufacture, advertise¬
ment, sale, transfer and possession of devices suitable
primarily for clandestine auditory or visual surveillance.
Legal provision shall be made for the confiscation and
destruction without compensation of recording and other
devices utilized in an offence involving clandestine auditory
or visual surveillance, whether or not the device was
intended primarily for such use.
States shall establish expert bodies to follow scentific
and technological developments and to draw the attention
of the legislature, the executive and the public to the effects
of such developments upon the right to privacy and to
possible safeguards required.

HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE THREAT TO PRIVACY (Continued)
vation, however, methods of psycho¬
logical and physical inquiry such as
those mentioned above may easily
interfere with the privacy of the indi¬
vidual concerned. The nature of the
questions asked in psychological and
psycho-physiological inquiries may be
such as to constitute a direct and
open interference, as may the bodily
invasions involved in the purely
physical tests.
Questions as to the subject's
political and/or religious preferences,
sex life and relationships within the
family may be considered in this
category, as may be the revelation
of one's innermost thoughts in ques¬
tioning under narco-analysis or the
discovery through physical tests of
filial relationships or alcoholic con¬
sumption. The recording of a person's
unsuspecting, unconscious or involun¬
tary reactions may amount to clandes¬
tine Interference.
It has been maintained that no in¬
vasion of privacy takes place where
the test is taken voluntarily. What
is "voluntary" represents, however, a
complex issue. For example, it
depends entirely on the law of the
particular state or locality whether a
person involved in a police inquiry or
in judicial proceedings, be it as a
suspect or accused or as a witness,
may decline a request that he submit
to a "lie-detector" test or to narco¬
analysis and what, if any, conclusions
may. be drawn from his refusal.
Where taking a "personality" test
or a "lie-detector" test is made a
pre-condition for hiring, continued
employment or promotion, or even
where this is merely "recommended"
as being "desirable", taking such a
test may not be a genuinely voluntary
act for a person seeking, or seeking
to retain, employment; the more so
as his refusal to take the test, if
recorded, may harm his chances of
obtaining employment elsewhere.
The absence of a meaningful form
of voluntary consent poses a threat to
privacy particularly in cases where the
personality assessment deals with
intimate features of one's personal,
sexual, religious or political life.
Q
14
iUITE apart from these
issues, there remains the question of
the scientific reliability or predictive
value, in ea^ch particular case, of pro¬
cedures such as those discussed
above. A validity record of 80 per
cent may be considered significant in
a research project seeking to establish
trends. The implied 20 per cent margin
for error, on the other hand, may be
significant where conclusions are to
be drawn about an individual human
being.
A further threat to the privacy of
the individual may arise when informa¬
tion obtained with his consent on
the understanding that it be treated
as confidential is disclosed without
consent, whether through computeri¬
zation or otherwise.
A survey of the willingness of some
130 corporations to release em¬
ployment test scores to other indivi¬
duals in the firm (especially immediate
work supervisors), to government
agencies, and even to other firms
indicated that 61 firms were willing
to release this information to imme¬
diate supervisors while only 25 would
release it to the employee himself.
Sixteen of these firms would release
this information to government agen¬
cies although the survey report does
not say for what purpose.
The use of norms compiled in one
country to interpret the meaning of
an individual's personality test scores
in another country may lead to
misinterpretation. This is particularly
likely when ready-made personality
test interpretations are available
through the mail. Claims have also
been made that personality assess¬
ment procedures may discriminate
against minority groups within a
country.
HE question of psycholo¬
gical and physical invasions of privacy
has been the subject of considerable
study in recent years.
The problems discussed are ethical,
technical and legal. Is it compatible
with respect for human rights, more
particularly respect for the privacy of
the individual, to use methods such
as those already discussed in order
to extract information from a person
without his consent or even his
knowledge? Is it possible to increase
the reliability of these methods of
inquiry as well as adapt them so as
to reduce to a minimum the invasion
of privacy they entail? Can the law
effectively regulate the use of these
methods and provide remedies for
persons whose rights have been
violated?
As for "personality" tests and "lie
detector" tests, much of the discussion
revolves around the use of these
methods in employment situations.
Thus the Director-General of the
International Labour Office, in his
report entitled Technology for Freedom
(Geneva, 1972) summarized the ques¬
tions relating to personality tests as
follows:
"No less serious for the future of
personal freedom [than intrusion upon
worker's privacy by surveillance
devices] are some of the possible
consequences of the erosion of
privacy by the growing use of
"personality tests" and "aptitude
tests" which have developed from
advances in psychology and psychia¬
try. Clearly, tests which make it
possible to place a worker in a job
corresponding to his qualifications
and aptitudes, or which can help to
determine more accurately a worker's
suitability for transfer to another job
or for promotion, are to be welcomed,
since they can make for improved
productivity and greater job satisfac¬
tion.
"To the extent that such tests can
be shown to measure variables, such
as manual and other skills, physical
dexterity or ability to handle machi¬
nery, which predict the extent to
which the worker will succeed in the
job or training course for which he
is applying, they can be most useful
tools of personnel policy. Testing
may indeed ensure greater equity in
selection than the more widely used
interview, but it presents two types
of problems.
"There is evidence that testing may
discriminate against culturally dis¬
advantaged groups. Such discrimina¬
tion may sometimes be intentional,
though generally it is likely to be due
to the simple fact that individuals who
are culturally disadvantaged or belong
to minority cultural groups are often
handicapped when competing with
others in certain types of tests. There
is here a potential, if unintended,
abuse of testing, which can be
eliminated only if testing procedures
are devised which can accommodate
a diversity of cultural backgrounds.
"Secondly, tests and interview tech¬
niques which seek to penetrate
personality and measure such impon¬
derables as emotions, attitudes,
mental equilibrium, adaptability, or
capacity to withstand psychological
stress may be designed to have the
subject reveal his political views or
his attitudes on intimate religious,
political, sexual or family matters; a
candidate, or even his family, may be
subjected to gruelling interviews and
other tests placing him under great
mental stress and he may be under
observation without even being aware
of it.
"The conclusions derived from tests
designed to penetrate an individual's
subconscious and to make him reveal
things about himself which bear no
direct relation to his future employment
may be of dubious validity, particu¬
larly if the tests are conducted and
analysed by persons who are not
highly qualified psychiatrists and
psychologists. An individual's whole
career may be compromised, and his
morale unnecessarily shaken, by
undependable or meaningless scores
in such tests.
"The employer or person who
decides not to employ the worker may
come into possession of a mass of
actual or inferred information of a
highly personal nature about him which
is not related to his work. Is not
the whole question of the relationship
to personal freedom of the encroach¬
ment of promotion and selection
techniques upon privacy another
issue of substantial importance for
the discharge of our commitment to
personal freedom?
"These issues have been made
much more acute by current develop¬
ments in information storage. Pre¬
judicial information, whether unfair or
misleading or not unfair but irrelevant
or best forgotten, has become much
more serious because less likely to
be forgotten or overlooked."

### 51341: New techniques for probing the mind

The frightening power to control people's behaviour through manipulation of their
subconscious minds, hinted at by George Orwell in "1984" and Aldous Huxley in
"Brave New World", may be nearer than we think. Experiments are being made to
sway our emotions by the technique of subliminal perception by the use of stimuli
that are perceived below the threshold of consciousness. In films, images can be
flashed on the screen for Just a fraction of a second. They are not registered by
the viewer's conscious mind, but register on his nervous system. If repeated often
enough they invade his mind without his being aware of what Is happening. In these
three frames from the film ' "My World Dies Screaming", a skull and the word
"blood" are Incorporated as subliminal projections.
HIDDEN
INVADERS
"There are now in active use
subliminal and brainwashing
techniques by which the sub¬
conscious of the individual is
invaded and his thoughts and
personality are influenced with¬
out his consent. These instru¬
ments can be smuggled in past
the customs of the senses. Some
methods of which I am aware
include ultra-sonic waves, inau¬
dible to the conscious senses,
just as the "silent" dog-whistle
is inaudible to man. At sonic
frequencies just beyond the
threshold of normal hearing you
can get through a silent message
without anybody being aware
ofit. The same thing is happening
in our presentation of films and
television. The subliminal film is
a very dangerous instrument and
has been authoritatively banned
in most countries. But control
is only possible at the point of
preparation since the whole
essence of the subliminal is that
it is not detectable at the receiv¬
ing end and therefore we have
to have strict scrutiny of what is
happening."

at the Young Sculptors Exhibition held at Unesco in
July 1972.

THE
BRAVE WORLD
OF DATA
SURVEILLANCE
In September 1970, the International Commission of Jurists in
Geneva undertook on behalf of Unesco a comparative study of. the
laws relating to the legal protection of the right to privacy. This
Unesco inquiry was carried out in 10 countries and its results were
published in N° 3, 1972. of Unesco's quarterly magazine "Interna¬
tional Social Science Journal" ( * ). Below we reproduce a passage
on "Data Surveillance" and "Legal Safeguards" from that issue.
I T is likely that within the
next twenty years most of the recorded
information in the world will be on
computers and more than half the
telephone calls will be communications
to and from and between computers.
As a method of storing information
and making it available, computers
are not only cheaper and more efficient
than conventional methods such as
books or files. They operate on an
entirely different dimension and make
possible the collection, collation and
distribution of information on a scale
hitherto unthinkable.
The machines on which all this data
is recorded need not themselves be
large. For instance, with a certain type
of computer based on the laser system,
it would be possible to have the equi¬
valent of twenty pages of information
about every man, woman and child in
the world on ten tapes, each
1,500 metres long and 2i centimetres
wide. A match-box can contain
computer-recorded information which,

The benefits to mankind which can
flow from the use of computers are
immense. It is plain that not only will
their use continue to grow, but com¬
puters will so dominate the scene in
a few years time that nearly all
information will be collected in the
form required for its storage In
computers.
There are a number of ways in
which computers can pose threats to
the privacy of the individual, but the
central one is the fact that they will
make it possible for a person having
access to the coded data on computers
to bring together all the recorded infor¬
mation, often of a private and per¬
sonal nature, about a particular person
in a way that would never have been
practical before.
People have become accustomed
to making a lot of information about
themselves available for particular pur¬
poses. Each item of information does
not in itself reveal very much and per¬
sons are willing to disclose it, confident
that those to whom it is given will use
it only for the purpose for which it
is intended.
If one thinks about the matter one
may also conclude that it would not
be practical for anyone to bring
together the different items of infor¬
mation in such a way as would enable
a picture, however distorted, to be
constructed of one's private life and
activities. All that is now changed by
the computer.
Examples of the kind of personal
information given to public author¬
ities include records of births, mar¬
riages and deaths, medical records,
records of education, military service,
passport applications, employment
records, social-security records, decla¬
rations for tax returns, applications for
licences of many kinds, motor-vehicle
registrations, post-office savings-bank
accounts and telephone accounts.
These records are usually based
on information voluntarily given by the
individual concerned or his relatives.
In addition, there may be confidential
records compiled by police or intelli¬
gence authorities.
A second category of records are
those compiled for commercial pur¬
poses and include bank accounts,
demands for credit facilities, credit-
card accounts, travel records including
ticket purchases and hotel bookings,
and hotel registrations.
Equally, records can be and are kept
by private firms of information about

people's supposed credit-worthiness,
without their knowledge, and supplied
commercially to inquirers. In the
United States a number of firms have
computerized records of the financial
position of more than 100 million
people.
Many such records can be used by
anyone with access to the computer
for purposes quite different to those
for which they were compiled, and
above all for purposes of surveillance.
One of the main problems of surveil¬
lance is to find the person who is to be
kept under observation. Use of a
credit card will reveal in a matter of
seconds where the holder is at the
moment that he presents it. Again, if
hotel and boarding-house registrations
are filed on computers, the same result
can be achieved.
From records such as these an
"inverted file" can be compiled in a
few minutes of all the recorded infor¬
mation about the places to which a
person has travelled over a period
of time, where he stayed and with
whom, what purchases he made at
what places and so forth.
The computer has the ability to
reorganize a large quantity of infor¬
mation (each element of which is
separately harmless) into a new quality
of information which may reveal more
than a person wishes to be known.
Furthermore, this connexion which
may be established between different
items of information concerning a
given individual, may be used as the
basis for passing judgement on him, a
secret judgement from which there can
be no appeal and which, because it is
based on a computer, is thought to be
objective and infallible. But in fact the
information used may be inexact, or
out of date or of no real significance,
with the result that the final conclu¬
sion amounts to a "scientific sophism".
Some writers consider that there is
a danger of serious interference with
the personal development of the indi¬
vidual resulting from the way in which
he is "presented" by the computer;
in the last resort he may be driven to
the point where he modifies his real
personality to suit that presentation,
behaving not in fact as he wishes but
as he feels he is expected to behave
"objectively" and "scientifically".
There is a further danger that the
individual will become too conscious
of his past rather than of his future.
Such domination of the private life of
the individual by technology could lead
to a veritable pollution of the human
personality.
These anxieties have been well sum¬
marized by Prof. Arthur Miller of the
U.S.A.: "The computer with its in¬
satiable appetite for information, its
¡mage of infallibility, its inability to
forget anything that has been put into
it, may become the heart of a surveil¬
lance system that will turn our society
into a transparent world in which our
home, our finances, our associations,
our mental and physical condition are
laid bare to the most casual observer."
Other dangers to privacy from com¬
puter data banks are that there may
be errors either in the information fed
into the computer or in the reorganiza¬
tion or "evaluation" of the information,
or simply errors due to mechanical or
electrical faults. Errors once recorded
tend to remain, for the simple reason
that it is cheaper and easier to retain
records in data banks than to eliminate
them. Another feature of computers
is that it is very simple to erase an
entry and substitute another, and unlike
alterations in a conventional file, these
alterations cannot be detected.
In principle there are a number of
ways, other than by legal sanctions,
in which the individual can be protect¬
ed and these risks reduced. These
lie in establishing good professional
standards, building in technical safe¬
guards and adopting secure adminis.-

trative procedures. Unfortunately the
present practice in all these respects
leaves much to be desired.
Attempts are being made in some
countries such as the United States
and the United Kingdom to establish
a professional code for computer pro¬
grammers but these are little more
than guidelines and programming is in
no sense a properly constituted and
disciplined profession. This is serious
not only because the information pro¬
grammers are handling is confidential,
but because they do not have the sta¬
bility of employment which might serve
as some guarantee that secrecy is
respected. An extreme example of
the lack of concern for privacy in the
computer world was seen when a
United States data system went out
of business and offered for sale to the
highest bidder its dossiers on three
million citizens.
On the technological level there are
a number of possible methods for
checking the "integrity" of the system,
for controlling access to the informa¬
tion (as by passwords or "keys") and
for controlling the processing of infor¬
mation. Many of these are expensive
to introduce, requiring elaborate "hard¬
ware" and "software" and are un¬
likely to be adopted except under
compulsion.
One specialist has compiled a list
of administrative safeguards which
could be introduced as a set of model
rules for operating computers contain¬
ing personal information. He proposes
that an independent advisory council
should have to be satisfied of the need
for the data and of the effectiveness
of the security measures before
authorization would be given to hold
personal data in computers.
He also proposes coded identifica¬
tions rather than names and addresses
and that personal files should be
erased at regular intervals of not more
than ten years. As far as is known,
there is no administrative code of this
kind in force in any of the countries
covered by the study carried out for
Unesco in 1970-71 by the International
Commission of Jurists, or indeed else¬
where.
Some of the dangers to individual
privacy from the operation of data
banks fall within the ambit of existing
laws, but very little legislation specifi¬
cally related to computers has yet
been passed in the ten countries dealt
with in Unesco's study.
Many countries have legislation
which make it an offence for public
servants to disclose without authority
confidential information acquired in
the course of their official duties. In
the United Kingdom, for example,
there are provisions of this kind in
the Official Secrets Act 1911 and in
the Taxes Management Act, 1970.
The recent legislation establishing
national data-processing services in
the United Kingdom imposes upon the
officials of the Post Office operating
the services an obligation of secrecy
with penalties of up to two years'
imprisonment for unauthorized dis¬
closure. The Federal German Penal
Code, which came into force in 1969,
provides for the protection of privacy
in automated information systems.
In the United States the Fair Credit
Reporting Act 1971 covers the acti¬
vities of credit reporting agencies. It
entitles an individual against whom
an adverse report is made to be told
about it. He is entitled to examine
the file maintained about him and to
have errors corrected.
It is known that the possibility of
legislation is being considered in a
number of countries, including Can¬
ada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and
the United Kingdom. A private
member's Bill on the subject was
introduced in the United Kingdom
Parliament.
HE only country, however,
which has introduced any comprehen¬
sive legislation on this subject is the
Land Hessen of the Federal Republic
of Germany. The Land Hessen's Act
of 1970 contains provisions for:
Imposing the duty of protection of
confidentiality in the method of op¬
eration of all data banks;
Imposing a duty of secrecy on the
operators, with penal sanctions;
Establishing an effective enforce¬
ment and complaints procedure
through the Data Protection Commis¬
sioner;
Giving the individual the right to
have errors corrected. It may be
commented that there appears to be
no right for the individual to know what
has been recorded about him. The
"right to verify" may prove ineffective
without a correlative "right to know".
Finally it should be mentioned that
the Union Internationale des Avocats
has prepared for the Council of Eur¬
ope a draft convention and model law
on the right to privacy which deals
with the question of data privacy,
including the storage of data, the
theft or misuse of data and the
publication of data.
It is to be hoped that the reports
prepared on the intergovernmental
level as a result of the 1968 resolution
of the U.N. General Assembly and the
answers submitted by governments
may serve as the basis for the pre¬
paration of an international convention
for the protection of human rights
against the dangers arising from scien¬
tific and technological developments.
It is only through an international
convention that sufficient legal pro¬
tection is likely to be provided to
ensure that technological devices do
not operate to the detriment of legi¬
timate human rights.

THE RUINS
OF PARADISE
Unearthed from Syrian sands
40 years ago, the ancient city
of Mari may now be doomed
20
by Andre Parrot
I N the summer of 1933,
on a hillock known as Tell Hariri near
Abu Kemal, in Syrian territory, some
Arab peasants who were looking for
stones to cover a grave came upon
a battered, headless statue distinctively
"Sumerian" in character. A few
months later, a French archaeological
expedition was sent from Paris to
explore Tell Hariri.
After a month of digging, we had the
good fortune to unearth a shrine
packed with votive statuettes of male
and female worshippers.
Three of the statuettes bore inscrip¬
tions in cuneiform script. Each inscrip¬
tion consisted of only four columns of
characters, but from them we learned
a great deal.
We discovered that the temple was
dedicated to Ishtar, goddess of war
and fertility. The votive offerings had
been dedicated by Ebih-il, a steward,
a "miller" named Idi-narum and, above
all, by a certain Lamgi-Mari who styled
himself king of Mari.
This was all we needed to identify
the site. Hariri, which was the name
of an Arab poet, could obviously not
have been the name of the town in
in antiquity. But the name Mari is
mentioned several times in ancient

ANDRE PARROT, honorary director of the
Louvre and curator-in-chief of the National
Museums of France, is one of the world's
great authorities on the ancient Near East.
His excavations at Baalbek in the Lebanon,
Larsa and Lagash in Irak, and most signifi¬
cantly at Marl in Syria, have added enor¬
mously to our knowledge of the history of
ancient Mesopotamia. He has written over
thirty books on Oriental and biblical archaeo¬
logy including two celebrated works trans¬

"Assur", published by Editions Gallimard In
their series "The Arts of Mankind", of which
he is co-editor with André Malraux. (English

When unearthed from the
sands of the Syrian
desert in 1936, this
"goddess with the flow¬
ing vase" was decapi¬
tated and in fragments.
Deity of one of the most
ancient civilizations that
flourished on the banks
of the Euphrates, the
human-sized statue was
buried for almost 4,000
years before its dis¬
covery on the site of
Mari, capital of a great
city-state with a history
dating back to between
3000 and 1800 B.C. With
both hands the goddess
tilts the aryballos or
vase, so arranged that
on certain occasions the
"life-giving waters of
fertility' flowed from a
hidden tank and issued
through the vase. Far

texts, in particular as having been the
capital of a dynasty (the 10th after
the Flood) and at one point the great
rival of Hammurabi, King of Babylon.
It was recorded by the scribes that
in the thirty-fifth year of Hammurabi's
forty-three year reign, an important
military operation was carried out (it
was the custom, at that time to
distinguish years by the major event
occurring during the twelve-month
period) and that "on the orders of
Anu and Enlil (two of the major
Mesopotamian gods, of the sky and
the earth respectively) Hammurabi
destroyed the walls of Mari".
It would seem that Mari was a
formidable as well as a feared city,
for two years previously Hammurabi
had already congratulated himself on
his "victory" over Mari and Malgia.
Once the identification of Hariri
with Mari had been established, it
could be expected that the results of
systematic exploration would be most
impressive, and so they were, even
as described here in bare outline.
Fifteen temples dedicated to the
different gods of this polytheist
civilization were found, with all their
votive sculptures, and although most
of these were broken, it was possible
to piece many of them together again.
As well as the temples, a gigantic
palace was brought to light, covering
more than eight and a half acres,
containing 300 rooms and courtyards,
and dating back to the nineteenth and
eighteenth centuries B.C., the royal
residence of a dynasty whose last
representative was Zimri-Lim the
very king who fought Hammurabi.
The palace contained several
extraordinary features: the throne
room, the area where the functionaries
had their offices, private apartments,
bathrooms still with their terracotta
bathtubs, chapels; nearly life-size
statues, including that of the governor
Ishtup-ilum, lying on the floor of the
throne room where it had fallen from
a dais, and the "trick" statue of the
"goddess with a flowing vase" from
which, by a system of connecting
vessels, the water of fertility could
be made to gush on certain days;
mural p a i n t i n g s religious scenes
(sacrifices, investitures) and geometric
patterns older than those of Crete;
and a royal library containing the
diplomatic and economic archives of
the kingdom, 25,000 tablets in cunei¬
form script which are now being
deciphered by a Franco-Belgian team
under Professor Dossin.
This is only the merest outline, but
there was more to come. Beneath the
second millennium palace, two more
palaces unexpectedly emerged,

ruins of Mari, capital city of a Mesopotamian kingdom, discovered some
forty years ago. Above, aerial view of the huge site today. At top left

THE RUINS OF PARADISE (Continued)
obviously older than the first and
undoubtedly belonging to the "tenth
dynasty after the Flood" mentioned
by scribes. Here again we found
fantastic architecture, more rooms,
courtyards, shrines.
But an even more astounding
discovery awaited us. Whereas the
walls of the earliest known third
millennium Mesopotamian palaces, at
Kish and Eridu, were still standing
only to a height of one or two feet,
the palace walls which we uncovered,
being superimposed, rose to a height
of 20 feet. Being protected by the walls
of the second millennium palace of
Zimri-Lim, destroyed by Hammurabi
about 1770 B.C., they were in a perfect
state of preservation.
Although the palaces at present
being excavated are indeed, for
buildings of their age, of an
extraordinary height and in a
remarkable state of preservation, the
shadow of disaster hangs over them.
The palace of Zimri-Lim was also
magnificently intact in 1939, yet in
the twelve years when it was left
unattended (from 1939 until work was
resumed in 1951) it was seriously
damaged by erosion. The reason is
quite simple: it was built of unbaked
bricks, i.e. sun-dried clay, and as
Hammurabi's soldiers had destroyed
the roofs, everything was now exposed
to the open air and doomed to decay.
Exactly the same fate total des¬
truction awaits the third millennium
palaces excavated between 1964 and
1972 unless something is done.
In its day, Mari, in the Middle
Euphrates region, was one of the most
brilliant centres of Mesopotamian
civilization, the civilization which grew
up in the biblical "Garden of Eden",
a land watered by a river which "when
it left the garden branched into four
streams" (Genesis 2: 10), including the
Euphrates and the Tigris.
It is a civilization whose extraordinary
achievements have been revealed by
over a century of archaeological
research. Museums in the East and
the West alike are full of objects
which offer for our admiration not
only accomplished works of art but
the evidence of human activity in all
its forms.
These objects were the work of
artists and craftsmen whose names

unknown. Different systems of
writing were evolved in different
countries, hieroglyphics in Egypt,
cuneiform script in Mesopotamia.
Beginning as pictograms, writing
became syllabic and finally, about
1300 B.C., on the eastern Mediter¬
ranean coast, alphabetic. The stage
was now set for great achievements.
The technical developments were
rapid. This is not a subjective view:
Mari was to be a convincing demons¬
tration and a perfect illustration of it.
The palaces of Mari are not only
monuments of Syria's past but also
part of the common heritage of
mankind. One of the aims of Unesco's
programme is to restore and protect
monuments, works of art and natural
sites of universal value threatened
with "deterioration and destruction"
two words which sum up exactly
the dangers which threaten the palaces
of the pre-Sargonid (third millennium)
period at Mari.
Something has to be done, and
done quickly; time is not on our side.
In this respect nature is a ruthless,
destructive enemy and vigorous efforts
must be made to protect the palaces
from its ravages.

THE SAGA OF ARMENIA'S
LOST MANUSCRIPTS
How they came to rest in the
Matenadaran at the foot of Mount Ararat
by David Fiks
DAVID FIKS, Soviet journalist and educator,
is a member of the editorial staff of the
Russian language edition of the 'Unesco
Courier" in Moscow. For several years
he has been literary editor of the Russian
edition.
LCCORDING to an old
saying, books have their special
destiny, just as men do. And this is
clear to anyone who examines the
ancient manuscripts in the Matenada¬
ran archives at Yerevan, capital of the
Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic.
Not only are the documents cracked,
bloodstained and damaged by fire and
weapons, but in many places great
holes gape like open wounds where
there were once delicate illuminated
miniatures of outstanding beauty.
The Matenadaran, today an institute
for the study of ancient manuscripts,
was originally a library founded in the
5th century by the Patriarch of Ech¬
miadzin, near Yerevan.
Its rich collection of manuscripts
symbolizes the tragic past of the Ar¬
menian people; the two histories are in
fact identical. And it is not by chance
that when old Armenian documents
speak of these books they use terms

artists are generally unknown although
a few have come down, to us, such
as Toros Roslin whose "Annunciation"

gospel. Below, a page from another
gospel, known as "The Gospel of the

normally applied to human beings,
telling how the works were "taken
prisoner" or "ransomed".
The adventures of many of these
manuscripts could indeed provide
themes for novels or short stories.
To save them from foreign vandalism
they were often buried, hidden in
forests or taken off into the mountains.
In 1204, after three years of
ceaseless work, Vardan Kafaetsi of
Mush (in western Armenia) finished
copying a set of sermons. Six hundred
calfskins had been used to make the
parchment, and the completed manu¬
script weighed 32 kilos (over 70
pounds). The owner valued it more
than anything else he possessed. But
he perished when the town was
invaded by the Seljuks who carried
off the manuscript.
Hundreds of men and women helped-
pay the ransom of 4,000 drachmas
(1 drachma was worth 4.65 grammes
of silver), and their names were
inscribed in the book. For nearly
seven hundred years it was kept in
the- library of the Holy Apostles Mon¬
astery in Mush then came the tragic
events of 1915. . .
Escaping from a massacre, two Ar¬
menian women spent the night in the
ruined monastery. In the morning they
discovered the enormous volume
abandoned in the church. They divided
it into two parts, to reduce the weight,
and having wrapped one part in a

### 51356: The Saga of Armenia's lost manuscripts: how they came to rest in the Matenadaran at the foot of Mount Ararat

years ago, the Matenadaran purchased
a very old manuscript, and it turned
out to be the missing half.
The two parts are now reunited
under the same binding. But a certain
number of illuminations have gone for
ever. Many pages are missing too,
though 17 of them turned up and are
now at the Church of the Mekhitharists
on the Island of San Lazzaro in Venice.
In fact nearly 4,000 Armenian manu¬
scripts are in the keeping of the
Venetian Mekhitharists, and 1,200 are
with the same congregation in Vienna.
Some 5,000 others are in Jerusalem
and nearly 1,000 at Isfahan. There are
also a number of Armenian manuscripts
in the British Museum, the Bibliothèque
Nationale in Paris, the Saltykov-
Shchedrin Public Library in Leningrad,
the Institute of Oriental Studies in
Moscow, the Historical Museum in
Tbilisi, etc.
At a rough estimate, about 24,000
Armenian manuscripts have survived
to the present day. But a great many
have unfortunately been lost.
The Matenadaran collection is not
only the world's largest, with over
11,000 texts, but also the most valuable.
It contains the oldest manuscripts and
therefore those of the greatest histori¬
cal interest. Many of them came not
only from Armenia but also from India,
Egypt, the Philippines, Cyprus and the
Crimea, and from cities such as Lvov,
Alexandria, Constantinople, Aleppo
and Leghorn.
This is not surprising, since by the
11th century the Armenian diaspora
had already begun, as the inhabitants
sought refuge from invasions and
conquests. They founded colonies all
over the world, and it was in these
places that the manuscripts were
made; for this was the only way the
Armenians could prevent their national
culture from degenerating or dying
out. Against the power of arms they
opposed the power of the word, and
the word prevailed.
Thanks to the copyists, the Ar¬
menian chronicles were written down
and the great heritage was preserved.
The copyists devoted their whole lives
to this noble task. They were often
poor and even destitute, living in
primitive lodgings and suffering from
cold or heat, but they worked on their
manuscripts from early morning until
late at night with extraordinary fervour
and they asked very little in return for
their labours. All they wanted was
"to be remembered". And they were
extremely meticulous.
"I know it only too well," records
one, "there are countless imperfec¬
tions in this manuscript, but I have
done what I could. My hand was
trembling and I could scarcely see
my first finger was paralyzed and I had
to use the middle one. What a
calamity. I have been working for
42 years now, and nothing like this
has ever happened before. I am
ashamed. Please forgive me . . ."
Often, a work was begun by one
copyist, continued by a second, and
completed by a third. At the end .of
the manuscript, the copyist generally
left what are called "commemorative
inscriptions". These are a precious
source of information about the politi¬
cal, social and economic situation at
the time. They teach us a great deal
about the copyist himself, too.
The copies were sometimes com¬
missioned by individuals, but generally
by monasteries, whose libraries had
been the main centres of written
culture since a poor unknown monk,
Mesrop Mashtotz, invented the Ar¬
menian alphabet in the 5th century.
In the 15th century, all the monastic
manuscripts were moved to Echmiad¬
zin, near Yerevan, where the seat of
the Supreme Catholicos, the head of
the Armenian Church, was transferred.
This collection forms the nucleus of
the present Matenadaran archives.
Until then, the manuscripts had been
kept in jumbled piles in cellars; and
the bad conditions had caused their
progressive deterioration. But in the
second half of the 18th century they
were finally given proper attention.
In the first half of the 19th century,
they were finally sorted, classified,
and arranged in specially designed
cupboards in two well-lit rooms near
the Catholicos' apartments. The first
list of these manuscripts was published
in 1837, Russian and French versions
of it being issued by Academician
M. Brosset in Saint Petersburg in 1840.
It only gave details of 312 manuscripts,

ARMENIA'S MANUSCRIPTS (Continued)

but it marked the beginning of their
proper study.
On December 17, 1920, the govern¬
ment of the Armenian Soviet Republic
recognized the Matenadaran as a
publicly owned State institution. In
1939, the Matenadaran was transferred
to Yerevan, where it became the
State archive of ancient manuscripts,
records and documents, to which was
later attached a scientific research
institute entrusted with the collection,
preservation and study of the manu¬
scripts.
Today, the Matenadaran houses
10,572 intact manuscripts in Old Ar¬
menian and 1,889 fragments, as well
as 1,365 texts in Arabic, Persian,
Greek, Latin, Ancient Hebrew, Russian,
Slavonic, Syrian, Ethiopian, Georgian,
Azerbaijanian and a number of other
languages, covering nearly 2,000 years
of the history of mankind, from the
4th to the 18th centuries.
It also contains more than 100,000
public records and a valuable collec¬
tion of ancient Armenian printed works,
including the first book printed in
Armenian: "Parzatumar" (a calendar
of church feasts published in Venice
in 1512 by the first Armenian printer,
Akop Megapart), as well as the first
Armenian journal "Azdarar" (the Mess¬
enger), published in Madras in 1794-6.
The oldest Armenian treasures in
the Matenadaran are fragments of
written texts from the 5th and 6th
centuries and illuminations from the
6th and 7th centuries. The very first
manuscript which has come down to
us in its entirety is a New Testament
inscribed on parchment in 887 A.D.
A secular work dating from 971 A.D.
is the oldest manuscript written on
paper existing in the U.S.S.R.
Among the unique specimens in the
Matenadaran, there is a history of
the Afghans, the ancestors of the
present-day Azerbaijanians, written
by Movses Kagankatvatsi in the 10th
century, and also very ancient written
copies of works from various coun¬
tries whose original texts are lost.
These works now exist only in their
Armenian translation. They include
"On Nature", by Zeno of Citium (4th-
3rd century B.C. Greek philosopher);
"The Chronicle", by Eusebius of
Caesarea (3rd-4th century A.D. bishop
and ecclesiastical historian); the seven
philosophical treatises of Philo Judaeus
(the great Hellenistic-Jewish philo¬
sopher who wrote during the first
40-50 years A.D.); "The Definitions"
of Hermes Trismegistos (the Greek
name given to Toth, the Egyptian god
of wisdom, as the reputed author or
source of the "Hermetic" works of
revelation); the last four chapters of
"The Preliminaries", by Theon of
Alexandria (4th century A.D. Greek
astronomer and mathematician).
The list of rare works in the Mat¬
enadaran is of course much longer, but
it is more important to stress that
there is not a single field of human
knowledge that has not found an
echo in these manuscripts.
Research workers find these docu¬
ments an inexhaustible source of infor¬
mation on ancient times and the
Middle Ages, as well as on philosophy,
theology, and law, on cosmography,
astronomy and geography, on peda¬
gogy, mathematics, chemistry and
alchemy, and en poetry, prose, music,
and art.
It is this that makes them so impor¬
tant for the science and history of
mankind. As the Chilean poet and
Nobel Prizewinner, Pablo Neruda has
noted: "The old sacred books of
wisdom and poetry continue to live
here like dried roses, still full of invisi¬
ble seeds..."
Many of the manuscripts have
already been published, mostly in
Armenian, but translations into foreign
languages have also appeared. This
has been made possible by detailed
study of the manuscripts following a
large-scale inventory. Each index card
lists the number of the manuscript,
the number of pages, the format, the
material (parchment, paper), the state
of preservation, the date and place of
production, the number of scribes,
the name of the person commissioning
the work and those of the restorers,
as well as details of the text itself.
A thematic catalogue has also been
made, classified according to branch
of knowledge.
Special methods have been worked
out for the preservation of the manu¬
scripts, based on the most recent
scientific and technological Innova¬
tions and the rooms are kept at a
constant temperature. Before being
placed in the archives, a "new" manu¬
script is disinfected and cleaned,
sheet by sheet; and the Matenadaran
Chemical and Microbiological Labora¬
tory is studying new and better ways
of disinfecting, restoring, preserving
and "treating" the manuscripts (the

### 51356: The Saga of Armenia's lost manuscripts: how they came to rest in the Matenadaran at the foot of Mount Ararat

most damaged sheets are consolidat¬
ed with a gelatine solution).
In the restoration laboratory, new
ways of counteracting harmful agents
attacking the manuscripts are being
worked out. The binding services
restore the flexibility of the dried skins
of the old covers and make new ones.
Microfilms and photographs are made
of unique copies.
All this enormous and difficult work
carried out in the Matenadaran is
State-supported. In 1959, a special
building was constructed to house the
Matenadaran manuscripts. This is not
only a depot, where the survival of
the precious words of human wisdom
and knowledge is assured, but also
a magnificent memorial to the thou¬
sands of Armenian sages, translators
and copyists who created and preserv¬
ed a vast cultural heritage which now
has its place among the treasures of
world culture.
MASTERPIECES
OF ILLUMINATION
The paintings and illuminations that embellish most of the Armenian manuscripts preserved
at the Matenadaran are masterpieces of the art of Illustration. They usually depict biblical
scenes: above, Jonah emerging from the whale's belly, painted by Toros Roslin; below
the Nativity and the Adoration of the Magi; left, a portrait of the apostle St John.

HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE THREAT TO PRIVACY


### 51339: Lawless frontiers of modern technology

Lawless frontiers (Continued from page 1 1)
the use, for purposes other than
accident or incident investigation, of
flight data recorders, and particularly
of cockpit voice recorders, which
cover all of a pilot's conversations
during a given flight. The International
Labour Organization has drawn atten¬
tion to certain aspects of this problem
as it affects freedom of association,
more particularly trade union rights,
and the personal freedom of the
individual.
In addition to the substitution of
modern techniques such as wire-taps,
secret microphones, transmitters and
cameras for more traditional methods
of supervision and surveillance, the
new technology makes possible en¬
tirely new approaches to surveillance.
It has been suggested, for instance,
that small sensing devices which may
monitor the location of and such other
facts about the wearer as his pulse
rate and the sounds in his immediate
surroundings, be worn by or implanted
on prisoners released on parole. This
would have the advantage not only of
disclosing immediately any violation
of some conditions of parole but also,
presumably, of inhibiting such vio¬
lations, thus making possible a more
widespread use of release on parole.
On the other hand, any utilization
of such devices for parole purposes
is being objected to on the grounds
that it would involve a total and
degrading deprivation ' of privacy,
beyond even conditions existing in the
average prison, which would make it
impossible for the parolee to establish
normal relations of love, friendship
and trust required for successful social
reintegration and would, moreover,
destroy the element of trust implicit
in the very concept of parole.
32
HE rapidly developing pro¬
ducts of a new technology are to some
extent being utilized in a legal vacuum,
since legal safeguards which evolved
at a time when such devices did not
exist may not cover them or may be
insufficient or inapplicable.
Thus, for example, telecommunica¬
tions legislation adopted in the 1930s
may be drafted in such a way as to
punish technical wire-taps but not
extend to the monitoring of telephone
conversations by other methods, such
as induction coils or miniature micro¬
phones.
Modern devices have also created
a new situation as regards the
remedies available to the person
whose privacy has been arbitrarily
invaded. Thus legal provisions
relating to trepass or unauthorized
entry of premises may be couched in
such language as to be inapplicable
in situations where the surveillance
device, though monitoring what is
happening inside the premises, is
installed on the outside.
In other cases the provisions, theor¬
etically applicable, may be so difficult
to enforce as to provide little or no
protection, as, for instance, where
hard-to-detect surveillance devices are
placed on the premises by persons
obtaining legal entry on false pretences
(for example, by a person pretending
to be a repairman or an employee of
a gas company).
The linking of computers to modern
surveillance devices is considered by
some as presenting "perhaps the most
significant threat to personal free¬
dom". An example given by one
expert, relating to telephonic communi¬
cations, describes such a combina¬
tion as follows:
"One of the simplest contemporary
snooping devices is the pen register,
which, when attached to a telephone
line, records a series of dashes
representing the number dialed from a
particular telephone. This snooping
capability could be magnified if the
information drawn in by the pen
register were automatically fed into a
central computer for analysis. Wide¬
spread use of this technique would
quickly reveal patterns of acquaintan¬
ces and dealings among a substantial
group of people."
The expert points out, however, that
such monitoring will soon be possible
without a pen register: "When tele¬
phone communications are completely
converted to digital transmission, it will
be easy to prepare a ready-made
machine-readable record of calls made
from other telephones to establish an
individual's or a group's associations."
Conflicts arise between the right
to privacy and the freedom to "seek,
receive and impart information and
ideas through any media and regard¬
less of frontiers" (Article 19 of the
Universal Declaration of Human
Rights).
This problem is not new and, in
fact, intrusions by the press have
previously given rise to many court
rulings concerning privacy. It has
been made more acute, however, by
the utilization on the part of the press
of new devices that facilitate clan¬
destine photography and the secret
recording of conversations.
Discussions of conflicts between
individual privacy and the freedom of
the press often revolve about the
question of what situations are to be
considered private or public, and of
whether legal remedies should be
available only where the material thus
published is defamatory or also where,
though not defamatory, it constitutes
an unwarranted intrusion upon a per¬
son's privacy.
Many studies concerning improved
protection of privacy stress that one
important factor is popular awareness
of the need to protect privacy, of the
means used to invade it and of mea¬
sures required to protect it.
Emphasis is also placed on the
existence of countermeasures to detect
or counteract the presence of sur¬
veillance devices. These include,
among others, searches of premises
for hidden devices; metal-locating
instruments; radio frequency probes;
the use of "scrambling" devices to
prevent eavesdropping on or tapping
of telephone or radio messages; and
lowering window shades to prevent
infra-red photography from outside.
expert suggests that
the easiest way of locating a trans¬
mitter microphone:
"is to have a radio receiver loud¬
speaker often a cheap FM transistor
radio receiver will do and tune this
receiver through its full range, making
sure that there is enough noise,
perhaps by whistling, to activate the
hidden microphone. The gain on the
transistor receiver should be set at
full volume. When the. receiver is
tuned to the frequency of the micro¬
phone radio transmitter any noise in
the room is likely to be picked up by
the microphone and transmitted to the
receiver which radiates it again from
its loudspeaker, and this feeds sound
energy back to the microphone.
"The result of this interaction is
usually a loud whistle or scream from
the transistor set, and by turning the
gain down until the scream stops and
then moving the transistor set until it
starts again, one can finally track down
the site of the microphone... The
system has the objection that the
generation of the squeal is a sure
indication to the eavesdropper that his
victim has awakened to the threat."
Television surveillance using an
infra-red sensitive eye for obtaining
pictures in an apparently dark room
could, it has been explained, be detect¬
ed by an infra-red photocell, rather
like those carried by military vehicles
and personnel to warn them when they
are coming under infra-red surveil¬
lance. But with the longer-wave infra¬
red devices, which work by the heat
radiated by bodies themselves, and
which are therefore "passive" such
a method of warning does not work.
While technical inventiveness can
make it possible to take counter-
measures, it can equally provide new
techniques to overcome counter-
measures, and so on ad infinitum.

Letters to the Editor
SCIENCE AND MYTH
Sir,
When I read Pierre Auger's article
"Science and Myth" (February 1973)
I was reminded of the words of Ortega
y Gasset (in History as a System, 1941):
"Scientific truth is exact, but it is
incomplete and penultimate and of
necessity embedded in another ultimate,
though inexact truth which I see no
objection to calling a myth. Scientific
truth floats in a medium of mythology;
but science taken as a whole, is it not
a myth, the admirable myth of modern
Europe?"
Now, I've been brought up on myths.
Indeed, the whole culture of India is
mythological. It is the language of the
seers, sages and saints of India, as
valid today as ever.
Myths are about the Being needs
of all humans, and in this capacity for
universal application they become the
generalisations which apply to the sub¬
jective side of reality. Their greatness
lies in their fullness, their richness,
their resonances with the many over¬
tones and undertones of the psychic
and moral life.
Ortega also reminded us that where
science stops, man does not stop.
The problem is, as we might see it,
this: that science cannot enter the lives
of men except in the form of myth, for
. myth deals with fundamental questions.
The attempt to demythologise religion
or "philosophy" is to make it increas¬
ingly unacceptable. Happily, many dis¬
tinguished scientists such as Edsin
Schrodouger and E. Böhm are aware of
this and are, therefore, somewhat like
Simone Weil, wanting to return to the
roots. Myth is the source of things.

NUCLEAR POLLUTION
Sir,
Your issue on pollution (January
1973) with its excellent articles and
illustrations was of particular interest.
But I am surprised that so little space
was devoted to the crucial problem of
radioactive pollution. By this I mean
not only the fall-out from atomic ex¬
plosions, but also the contamination
caused by nuclear power stations.
Scientists throughout the world (physi¬
cists, biologists, biochemists, among
other) have expressed their anxiety
about this question, and the Club of
Rome, which is mentioned In your
January issue, is also concerned about
the problem.
Nuclear power stations are today a
danger to human, animal and plant life.
Reactors in normal use constantly emit
radioactive waste in the form of liquids
and gases wastes that no one knows
how to store and which remain radio¬
active for anything from a few years
to several centuries. And there are also
considerable potential risks due to earth¬
quakes, accidents, sabotage, etc.
This problem deserves to be dealt
with in greater depth, especially as it
is now a general policy of industrially
developed countries to build more and
more nuclear power stations regardless
of the risk of causing cancers, leucaemia
and other malformations among the
world population at large.
Catherine Lieber
Cachan, France
The "Unesco Courier" spoke out on
the dangers of nuclear pollution nearly
15 years ago. In 'Is the Ocean in
Danger?" (August-September 1969) and
in "Atoms Overboard" (August-Sep¬
tember I960) it described the risk of
radioactive contamination by wastes
from nuclear power stations. Other
articles (in the August-September 1967
and November 1970 issues, for instance)
have reiterated such warnings. Editor.
YOUTH BULLETIN
ON THE ENVIRONMENT
Sir,
I congratulate you on the quality of
the January 1973 issue devoted to envi¬
ronmental conservation. I feel sure that
the "Unesco Courier" will have increas¬
ed public awareness of the threats to
the environment in all those countries
where it is read.
Your contributors presented the facts
in a logical fashion and demonstrated
that the ecological crisis has its roots
in man's exploitation not only of natural
resources but also of his fellow man.
Materialism is supported by an econ¬
omic system which deprives develop¬
ing nations of their share of the world's
resources, while the citizens of develop¬
ed countries are increasingly exhorted
to consume more than they actually
need. Until we achieve an equal dis¬
tribution of wealth and a stable econ¬
omy, we shall not be able to enjoy
our life in harmony with nature.
May I draw your readers' attention
to a unique new periodical, supported
by Unesco Taraxacum, the International
Youth Bulletin on the Environment
which is intended as a contact point
for young ecologists and youth organi¬
zations throughout the world. It is
available (in English, French or Spanish
language versions), from: Th. Vethaak,
Populierenlaan 193, Amstelveen 1134,
The Netherlands. It is hoped that the
Bulletin will serve to stimulate young
people in their struggle to create a
better world for tomorrow.

VIOLENCE VIA TV
Sir,
I read with interest the article "TV
the new tom-tom... but what is the
message?" (February 1971) and also
"International Problems of Television
via Satellite" (February 1973).
One would also like to know how
television is being used in different
countries as an educational medium.
For example, a report appeared in our
local press on January 2, 1971, that
25,000 Britons will begin university
courses on television aimed at bachelor
of arts degrees. Also interesting would
be a survey of the findings throughout
the world of studies that have been
made and reports issued on the social
repercussions of TV and movie viewing.
An important contemporary question is:
How effective can education for world
peace be when violence is so often
presented as entertainment in movies
and TV?
Another interesting topic would be
cigarette smoking and lung cancer
around the world. In North America
the incidence of lung cancer continues
to soar. Advertizing of cigarettes in
publications continues, despite growing
pressure that advertizing of products
detrimental to human health and welfare
be banned.

A photo report on the Open University
in Britain, referred to above, appeared
in our special issue on the report of
Unesco's International Commission for
the Development of Education (Novem¬
ber 1972). As regards the relationship
between cigarette smoking and cancer,

Italy to spend $510 million
to safeguard Venice
Italy is to spend 300 billion lire ($510
million) on priority preservation work in
Venice. A recent Italian law authorizes
an international loan for this sum to be
spent over the next five years on urgent
works to protect the lagoon against the
sea, combat and reduce pollution, instal
new water supply and drainage systems,
modernize dwellings and restore monuments
and works of art. Following this decision,
Unesco has opened an office in Venice
to co-ordinate international action with the
efforts of the national authorities. Since
Unesco's international appeal for Venice
in 1966, several countries and some 30
private organizations have made contribu¬
tions totalling 1,500 million lire. Unesco
has also helped to preserve monuments
in Venice and has aided scientific research
on the city's special problems.

Mouton and Co., The Hague. Originally
published in Hungarian, the work was
edited by V. Dioszegi, a young Hungarian
anthropologist who has made a specialty
of Siberian, Finnish, Hungarian and Turk¬
ish shamanism and is the author of a
popular book "Tracing Shamans in Siberia",
published in 1968 by Anthropological
Publications, Oosterhout, Netherlands.
Nomads of Asia
and Europe
Unesco and the Mongolian Academy
of Sciences were joint sponsors of a
recent conference on the role of nomadic
peoples in Central Asian civilization.
Held in Ulan Bator, capital of the Mon¬
golian People's Republic, the conference
examined the present situation and cultural
trends among nomadic peoples. Unesco
has also recently assisted in the publica¬
tion of a historical study of the art and
mythology of the nomads of the period
of the great migrations. "L'Art des
Nomades : des Scythes aux Hongm.-s",
by professor Gyula László, published by
Corvina Press, Budapest (1972), demon¬
strates the deep underlying links that
unite the peoples of Europe and Asia.

is now the world's most populous city,
followed by Tokyo (8,841,000) and New York
(7,895,000) according to the latest U.N.
Demographic Yearbook.
The 1,070 metre main span of the
world's fourth largest suspension bridge,
linking Anatolia with Europe across the
Bosphorous, was recently welded into
position. The bridge will open for traffic
later this year.
The 1972 Unesco Architecture Prize has
been awarded to Vladimir Kirpitchev, a
student at the Moscow Institute of Archi¬
tecture, for his project for a small-town
recreation centre.
World energy consumption rose 63 per
cent between 1961 and 1970, at an annual
rate of 5.6 per cent, mostly through the
use of petroleum and natural gas, reports
the U.N. Statistical Yearbook.
Unesco has received £600,000 ($1.5
million) proceeds from the British Museum
exhibition of treasures from Tutankhamun's
tomb for the campaign to save the temples
of Philae on the Nile.
M The International Agency for Research
on Cancer in Lyons (France) is to devote
an extra $319.000 to research this year.

PEARLY-EYED
GODDESS
Unearthed in Syria in 1964 by an ar¬
chaeological expedition working at
the famed site of Mari, lost city of
ancient Mesopotamia, this bronze
statuette dates back to the 3rd mill¬
enium B.C. Her hair worked in silver
and her eyes fashioned from mother-
of-pearl inset with pupils of lapis¬
lázuli, this dainty goddess wears a
diadem of gold and stands only
11 cm. high. The palace at Mari
where she was discovered is one
of the oldest in the world. Urgent
action is needed to prevent the
palace walls, eroded by the elements,
from collapsing (see article page 20).
