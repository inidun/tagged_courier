TAO
1 964, assemblage
(78 x 45 x 8 cm),
wood and paint with ash
by Wim de Haan
(1913-1967)
This work by a Dutch
painter whose life was
marked by his experience
as a prisoner of war
illustrates its creator's
faith in humankind and
his desire to reconcile
anatagonisms. It is a
tribute to Lao-tzu,
traditionally considered
to be the founder of
Taoism. The literal
meaning of the word tao
is "way", and here the
artist has inserted the
face of the old Chinese
sage in a signpost-shaped
structure which contrives
to suggest both a set of
Western traffic signals
and the wayside shrines
containing sacred effigies
which are found in the
Orient. Humour blends
with gravity in this work
spanning two cultures.

### 93729: Interview with Luc Ferry

LUC FERRY
talks to Bahgat Elnadi and Adel Rifaat
Luc Ferry is a French philosopher,
educator and essayist. In this
interview he analyses the
ideological background of current
ecological thinking and, as a
supporter of an approach to the
environment based on democratic
ethics, defines his conception of
modern democracy in the light of
historical experience. Among his
published works in English are
Homo £stheticus and Heidegger
and Modernity (University of
Chicago Press). An English version
of his latest book, Le nouvel ordre
écologique, will also be published
by the University of Chicago Press.
Your latest book, Le Nouvel Ordre
Écologique ("'The New Ecological Order "J
has caused quite a stir. Is this because it
attempts to make a distinction between
"good" and "bad" ecology?
My book is about the debate within
ecology, which is largely concerned with two
fundamental philosophical problems. The
first is the problem of the rights of nature:
does nature have an intrinsic value, and if so,
what kind of value? The second is the
problem of the relationship between ecology
and the modern world: to what extent does
ecology question the basis of modern civi¬
lization? Very different attitudes to these two
questions have evolved within ecology, par¬
ticularly in the United States, Canada and
the countries of northern Europe. This is
what my book is about.
On the question of the rights of nature,
there are three basic positions in ecology
today. According to the first, nature has no
rights and no intrinsic value and our only
reason for protecting nature is because it con¬
stitutes our environment, that is to say the
periphery of a figure having the human race
at its centre. If we do not protect the envi¬
ronment, so the argument goes, we shall not
be able to provide the human race with the
conditions for a decent life; but the human
race remains the sole possessor of rights or, as
philosophers used to call it, the only "end in
itself". In the United States this is known as
the environmentalist position. It denies nature
any legal status and rejects the idea that nature
as such has any value.
The second position that of the utili¬
tarians concedes that nature does possess
some rights. It maintains that all creatures
that are capable of feeling pain or pleasure
should fall within the purview of the law. It
is often forgotten that utilitarianism is not a
selfish, individualistic doctrine but one whose
aim is to produce the greatest good for the
greatest number and the least possible suf¬
fering. If we accept this principle, say the
utilitarians, there is no reason why animals
should not be a subject of moral and legal
concern. This position, which has consider¬
able support in the United States and in
Australia, provides the sanction for the animal
liberation movement, as at present repre¬
sented by Peter Singer, which has almost
twenty million supporters in the Anglo-
Saxon countries.
The third position is that upheld by those
known in the United States as "deep ecolo¬
gists", who believe that the order of priorities
inherited from the humanist tradition should
be reversed. Instead of putting the human
species first, followed by animal, vegetable
and mineral, the deep ecologists maintain that
the biosphere or the Earth should come first,
followed by living species in general, with
human beings if there are any left in last
place. According to this approach the human
race is the most "antipathetic" species because

## [Page 5](093750engo.pdf#page=5) 0

### 93729: Interview with Luc Ferry

it alone is capable of turning against nature to
the extent of destroying it; it is the species
that is supremely antagonistic to nature, the
species that causes pollution and is, in ecol¬
ogists' eyes, the most open to criticism.
This viewpoint can be found, to a greater
or lesser degree, in the writings of philoso¬
phers such as Hans Jonas in the United States
and Michel Serres in France. The latter used
it as the basis for the idea of a "natural con¬
tract" a contract with nature, as against the
kind of social contract between human beings
that forms the basis of the Declaration of
the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 1 789.
It is also the position set out by some ecolo¬
gists such as James Lovelock, who in his
book Gala depicts the Earth as a living
organism, and the biosphere as the only true
possessor of rights. It was with these currents
of thought in mind that I subtitled my book
"L'arbre, l'animal et l'homme" ("Trees, ani¬
mals and man"), precisely the order of pri¬
orities on which a new ecological order is
based.
These are, broadly speaking, the different
points of view relating to nature as a pos¬
sessor of rights. The position of the deep
ecologists in particular poses a real problem:
although in my opinion their point of view is
both indefensible and dangerous, since it rel¬
egates the human race to second or even
third place in the hierarchy of possessors of
rights, it does raise the valid question, which
is overlooked by the Cartesian tradition, as
to why we attribute a value to nature inde¬
pendently of our own interests.
So it is the thirdpoint ofview that implies
a radical critique of the modern world?
Yes, the linkage is both fairly simple and
rather deep. For those who adopt the third
viewpoint, which maintains that the rights of
nature should take priority and that the true
possessor of rights is the biosphere, the
modern world is heading in quite the wrong
direction. The deep ecologists often use the
image of a car travelling the wrong way along
a highway. It's no use slowing down, they say,
the car must make a U-turn immediately.
This image of the turn-around a revolu¬
tion in the etymological sense gives some
idea of the kind of revolution they want to
see, rather conservative, reactionary even,
since it means turning our backs on humanist
civilization.
This critique of the modern age in the
name of the rights of the biosphere has
recently been made in films like Dances with
Wolves and The Big Blue. It is an ideology that
informs certain trends within the Green par¬
ties of northern Europe and in organizations
like Greenpeace, which makes no bones about
defending anti-humanist or "supra-humanist"
values. Some people go so far as to say that
human expansion should be limited, by force
if necessary, to protect the environment.
All right. But don 't you think that to make
thispointby quotingNazi texts, asyou do in
your book, is going too far?
I should like to explain why I did this. In .
my opinion people do not always under¬
stand what Nazism really was. Many people
remember only the horror and barbarism of
Nazism, and of course this is perfectly nat- 1
ural, but the reason why the Nazi programme
held an attraction for 80 to 90 per cent of the
German people was because initially it had
something sufficiently profound and forceful
about it for it to gain the support of great
thinkers like Heidegger, Karl Schmitt, Alfred
Bäumler and many others, including some 40
to 50 per cent of biologists and doctors at
that time. There must have been something
else, apart from the cult of the leader, violence
and anti-Semitism. That something else was |
the German Romantic tradition, which '
expressed in a profound form extremely I
strong ecological preoccupations. Am I to j
blame if these ideas are found in Nazi laws I
adopted between 1933 and 1935 at Hitler's I
demand?
These laws took from the Pvomantics the
idea that nature must be considered as pos- ¡
sessing rights, as an entity to be protected,
quite independently of human interests, the
idea that we must rediscover a lost past, a
state of nature as it was before the coming of
civilization. Take, for example, the 1933 law
on the protection of animals, an extremely
detailed law that ran to almost 1 80 pages. It set
forth the important principle, which has been
adopted by today's deep ecologists, that ani¬
mals should be protected for their own sake.
This idea is hammered home again and again
in the German text. Until then the law had at
best only protected domestic animals from
cruelty inflicted on them in public, in other
words in the presence of human beings. In
France the philanthropic and humanist Loi
Grammont of 1850 had similar provisions,
although it did not protect wild animals, and
did not protect domestic animals from abuse
inflicted in private. The Nazi law, for the first
time in history a Belgian law around the
same time did the same thing protected wild
animals and prohibited cruelty to animals,

## [Page 6](093750engo.pdf#page=6) 0

### 93729: Interview with Luc Ferry

even in private. Clearly the aim was to protect
natural creatures for their own sake and not
insofar as they affect the interests or sensi¬
tivities of human beings.
Can we conclude then that this is a
coherent anti-humanist vision?
The fundamentalist version of deep ecology
does indeed imply a radical critique of the
humanist civilization inherited from the great
declarations of the rights of man. The decla¬
ration of 1789 in France and that of 1776 in
America are both manifestly anthropocen-
tric. In both of them, nature is secondary,
peripheral.
The German Romantic movement and
Nazi ecology both criticized modern
humanism in the name of a lost past, but it is
also possible to criticize modern humanism in
the name of a diametrically opposed ideal,
that of a radiant future. I am thinking here of
communist, Marxist societies or those advo¬
cating joint worker-management control, soci
eties which have claimed to solve ecological
problems by jointly or centrally planned
industrial and technological development.
What is really interesting about contem¬
porary ecology, as regards both Greenpeace
and the so-called deep ecologists, is that it
contains an explosive mixture of the two cri¬
tiques. Those ecologists who think of them¬
selves as revolutionaries mix together ideas
which I would describe as those of the far
right criticism of universalism, modern sci¬
ence and cosmopolitanism in the name of
local roots and the purity of the species
with extremely progressive ideas such as self-
management, the use of the referendum,
grass-roots initiatives, votes for foreigners,
and so on.
Because of this mixture of ideas it is
wrong to label these people "ecolo-fascists"
or "green Khmers", as some French papers
have been much too quick to do. True radi¬
cals are of the right and the left simultane¬
ously. There is ample scope for a study of
how European leftist ideas of the 1960s para¬
doxically borrowed from the differentialist
themes that were those of the counter-revo¬
lutionary right.
In your critique ofcertain currents within
ecology, you take your bearings from the
philosophy of human rights that was the
main subject ofyour earlier theoretical works.
Let us now widen our discussion and talk
about human rights. Perhaps it would be a
good idea to start by establishing to what
extent human rights are a specifically modern
concept.
Human rights are indeed different from
other rights, such as those that existed in
many ancient societies, or even from those
proclaimed by different religions. When we
talk about human rights we are not talking
about a greater or lesser degree of tolerance
but about a root-and-branch revolution that
makes the individual the basic value, reversing
the order of priorities as between human
beings and everything that hitherto took
precedence over them nature, religion or
the community.
By the Declaration of 1789, for the first
time in history, rights are created for and by
human beings. This represents a break with all
earlier conceptions of law, which rooted law
either in the natural order, as was the case in
Greek and Roman Antiquity, or in a theolog¬
ical universe, as during the Middle Ages in
Europe. The Declaration of 1789 initiated
political humanism in the sense that from then
on it would be human beings, acting in the light
of their interests, their reason and their will,
who enacted the law in those very specific
institutions known as national parliaments.
But let's hang on to this totally new idea
that human beings have rights because they
are human beings, not because they belong to
some national, ethnic, cultural or religious
community, but by virtue of their member¬
ship of the human race, of humanity.
We might call this abstract humanism,
because it regards humans as possessing rights
irrespective of the specific community to
which they belong. This, essentially, is what
distinguishes the legacy of the Enlightenment
as it is embodied in the Declaration of the
Rights of Man of 1789 on the one hand, and,
on the other hand, the counter-revolutionary
Romantic tradition, which rejected this form
of humanism in the name of the individual's
specific allegiances and proclaimed that
people belong to a community that enfolds
and protects them and confers these rights on
them. These are, obviously, fundamental
issues.
And the debate continues. Some people
still interpret the Declaration ofthe Rights of
Man and ofthe Citizen in terms ofa "right to
be different".
This is not, of course, the correct inter¬
pretation. It is on the contrary a counter¬
revolutionary interpretation, which main¬
tains that we have rights as creatures who
"differ" one from another, and that this dif¬
ference is mainly rooted in culture. This is

## [Page 7](093750engo.pdf#page=7) 0

### 93729: Interview with Luc Ferry

another very important idea. The Romantics
tell us that human beings owe their humanity
to culture, because it is culture that differen¬
tiates humans from animals, they are human
by virtue of belonging to a cultural commu¬
nity, a nation for example.
The revolutionaries accept that culture
distinguishes man from the animals, but they
differ from the Romantics in their definition
of culture. In their eyes culture is not an
objective datum which is imposed on man
rather like an extension of his original envi¬
ronment. It is not something obvious, not a
kind of inheritance or a "second nature".
Culture is what we build for ourselves. It is
not the same kind of thing as tradition, it is
something that is wrested away from nature.
Culture ushers in the reign of freedom by
wresting itself away from nature. With this
distinction you have the whole of revolu¬
tionary ideology in a nutshell. As Rabaut
Saint-Etienne said in a famous phrase, our his¬
tory is not our code. Democratic culture is a
culture built over and against whatever is
there in the first place nature in the strict
sense, or tradition, which is a second nature.
This is a key question. In the past half
century, which has been dominated by the
problems of decolonization, there has been
much confusion between these two defini¬
tions ofculture. For colonized societies it was
vital to stress the identity ofthe group, the cul¬
ture ofthe group, culture as an inheritance, as
a way ofstanding up to the colonialpower.
It is not hard to understand that the logic
of the right to be different was appropriate in
the first phase of the struggle, but later it
came to be perverted. It was appropriate at
first because it formed a basis for the defence
of cultural entities whose survival was threat¬
ened by colonial imperialism. What was
important at that stage was to defend some¬
thing that already existed, an area of identi¬
fication in which even traditions, even the
most conservative allegiances, could be useful.
There was a kind of instinct for survival at
work here something quite legitimate and
understandable.
But since the colonies achieved indepen¬
dence, this emphasis on distinctive identities
has led on to the present situation in which
individuals are corralled into groups and
these groups are corralled into what amount
to cultural ghettos, pitted against one another.
Basically, two historical perversions have fed
upon each other: universalism was perverted
into a colonialist, i.e. false, universalism, a
European specificity which claimed to be
universal, while the anti-colonial struggle,
which was initially legitimate, eventually led
to a new communalism, a new chauvinism,
the effect of which has been to close off again
the area of freedom partly opened by the vic¬
tory over colonialism.
Let's get back to the difference between the
human and the animal. In the eighteenth
century, the definition ofmodem humanism
focused on this question.
Absolutely. For the Enlightenment
philosophers who were behind the
Declaration of 1789, the distinguishing char¬
acteristic of animals was that they were ruled
by natural instincts. I think this distinction is
still valid in zoological and scientific terms.
Animals have no history. Animal societies
societies of ants, termites or bees have not
changed for thousands of years because their
lives and those of the individual animals
which constitute them are governed by invi¬
olable rules, the rules of nature and instinct.
The human race, on the other hand, is dis¬
tinguished by its ability to transcend the rule
of instinct, what the Enlightenment philoso¬
phers called freedom. By setting itself apart
from nature, the human race entered a
twofold process the process of historical
development and the process of universality.
Historical development means that when
a living species ceases to be governed by the
inviolable code of nature, it enters the realm
of perfectibility. Education teaching and
learning is a specifically human activity.
Children have to learn life skills, whereas
little tortoises and crocodiles are quite capable
of managing on their own. Education may
come from different sources from parents,
school or television but it is indispensable.
The great difference between humankind and
the animals is that humankind, precisely
because it is not governed by instinct, is
capable of transmitting one generation's her¬
itage to the next.
Even when animals have been trained by

## [Page 8](093750engo.pdf#page=8) 0

### 93729: Interview with Luc Ferry

human beings, they are incapable of teaching
others what they have been taught. A circus
animal will not give birth to another circus
animal but to an animal that will return at
once to the eternal laws of nature. The dif¬
ference between human beings and animals
lies in the historical process, and in the early
days of ethnology this posed a fundamental
problem: how to classify societies that were
labelled as "primitive" or "savage", since they
seemed to have no history? These societies
seemed to be ruled by something that resem¬
bled nature tradition. In my opinion this
problem remained unsolved until Lévi-
Strauss and contemporary Marxist anthro¬
pology appeared on the scene.
Universalism was the second consequence
of humankind's distancing itself from nature.
By wresting themselves free from their spe¬
cific situation, whether cultural, national, lin¬
guistic or biological the fact of being a man
or a woman human beings can enter the
sphere of universality, in other words they can
familiarize themselves with other cultures,
learn other languages, discover other forms of
art or politics than their own. In so doing
they recognize other human beings, no matter
what culture they belong to, as their fellows,
thereby discovering their common humanity.
The moment we put behind us the specific sit¬
uation from which we set out is the moment
when we attain humanity and move from
the particular to the general. Modern ethics,
the ethics of the French Revolution and the
Enlightenment, favours choosing the uni¬
versal by overcoming the dead weight of
one's specific initial situation.
Why is modern democracy unimaginable
without this attempt to distance ourselves
from nature and tradition and accede to the
universal?
Well, if you base democracy on discus¬
sion, if you think that in a democracy the
law should originate in debate founded on
rational argument rather than on a scriptural
authority or a patriarchal tradition, you must
realize the full implications of this. Rational
argument presupposes the ability of those
who take part in it to set aside their initial
positions. For example, if they talk about
abortion purely and simply from their points
of view as women or men, Catholics or
Muslims, they will never reach agreement:
there's no such thing as a universally valid
argument. If you want to legislate on racism,
you can't do it exclusively as a Black or an
Arab or a Jew, you have to be able to put
your case as a human being. At the root of
everything that is worthwhile in democracy
is the principle of liberty, which means dis¬
regarding the specific positions that are one's
starting point and acceding to the universal
through the use of reason.
Let's turn to democracy and its internal
contradictions, which each country has ulti¬
mately to resolve in its own way. Let's start
with the age-old debate about the two kinds
of rights, rights as freedoms and rights as
entitlements.
The former, which are sometimes called
"formal" rights, are by and large those of the
Declaration of 1789 freedom of opinion,
equality before the law, freedom of move¬
ment, the right to own property. They take us
back to the problems connected with the
limitations of state power. Limiting the
powers of the state is a central notion, the
basis of the tradition of political liberalism. At
the time of the French Revolution, there was
a need to impose limits on absolutism: all
the rights of 1 789 are limits on the legitimate
competence of the state. The right to own
property and the right to freedom of opinion
mean that the state has no right to take away
your property without good reason and no
right to impose an ideology or a religion
upon you. The right to security of the person
prohibits the state from sentencing a person
without trial, so these rights are primarily
political principles limiting state interven¬
tion rather than simple principles of tolerance.
The other type of rights entitlements
or "social" rights made their appearance
around the middle of the nineteenth century.
They relate to a totally different set of prob¬
lems, since they call for increased state inter¬
vention, particularly in social and economic
life. If you maintain that the citizens of a
state have the right to work, it follows that the
state must assume the responsibility of pro¬
viding them with work, which means
directing the economy to some extent. Here
the difference between the two types of rights

writers
look at
love
In a sense the theme of the present issue has dictated the form of its
treatment giving carte blanche to a number of writers from different
parts of the world.
We have long wanted to publish an issue devoted to the subject of love
as it is experienced in the modern world. We thought about it, asked
around, tried first one angle, then another and yet another. But the theme
proved to be particularly elusive: the authors we approached either backed
off or, if they accepted, turned in pieces far different from what we had
expected. It became clear that love could not be treated conventionally like
any ordinary topic, with a structured list of contents and following
predictable lines of enquiry. We finally came to the conclusion that it not
only needed but deserved special treatment, a different approach.
We decided to ask ten different writers a single question what do you
want to say about love today? and let them get on with it, giving them an
entirely free hand.
The result was a set of contributions that were totally different from
anything we could have imagined at the start, and went far beyond what
we might have hoped for. Thanks to their talent, intuition and experience,
the ten authors, given their head, had managed, in a series of lucid,
inspired improvisations that caught the right notes to render the
tremulous music of loving today.
We received pieces on the power of the love that scoffs at barriers of
class, race and frontiers (André Brink) or that comes to terms with racial
intermingling and finds a universal sense (Henri Lopes); the magic of a
love that exorcises the alienation of the exile Q.M.G. Le Clézio) or that
ultimately becomes one with the love of life itself (Luisa Futoransky); the
fullness of a love to which the whole being is committed, body and soul
(René Depestre); the paradox of love whereby the philanderer, always in
pursuit of his prey and never tied down, yet finds himself less free than
ever (Tahar Ben Jelloun); the ambiguous myths of love, reinvented by
Hollywood as an antidote to the everyday world (Jerome Charyn); love as
a metaphor for the submission of a humble Indian librarian to a career-
conscious woman politician (Nina Sibal); love breaking free of childhood
dreams, trying in vain to enter the world of the present (Mahmoud
Hussein); and lastly, love abandoning the pretence of being everlasting,
accepting that it is transient and bounded by time (Jorge Enrique Adoum).
We were still left with a difficult problem: whether to publish
everything as it stood, even things that seemed to some of us inappropriate
or extreme, even what was expressed in terms that the Courier could not
endorse.
The answer was, and could only be, yes. Not only because it was the
price to pay for freedom of expression, but also because that freedom had
succeeded where our own concern with planning had failed. The result is
the present issue.

I OULD you write a simple love story if
you wished?"
It was in the mid-1980s, in the darkest time of
the apartheid era, and the question was asked by
a woman journalist in France. She was very
serious. I, too, took it seriously. So seriously, in
fact, that in due course I wrote a whole novel
States ofEmergency to attempt an answer to her
question. I am still not sure what the answer was:
novels tend not to be unifocal. A main character
in the book, a man who tries to write a book to
find out whether he can write a book about love
while living in a society disrupted and maimed by
apartheid, abandons the writing of his book,
which tends to suggest that such an endeavour is
impossible. Yet my own novel is there which
tends to suggest the opposite.
The point is not the answer that was
attempted. The point is that such a question was
asked in a sense had to be asked at all. And
that it was so serious. There cannot, surely, be
many societies in our world in which it would be
making the kind of sense it does in South Africa.
Even before an answer was attempted the ques¬
tion itself suggested something deeply disturbing:
about writing; about the society in which it is
done; and about love.
In a way, of course, it is linked to Brecht's
familiar question about the kind of society in
which one cannot write about trees, for fear of
being silent about so many other things. "Other
things" being, primarily, politics. (Had Brecht
lived a few decades later, he might not have posed
his question: writing about trees today is one of
the most political acts imaginable. This in itself
should be reason to pause.)
The problem about this kind of reasoning
lies in its assumptions about the "nature" of trees,
and of love, and of politics.
In the traditional free democracies of the
West none of which can qualify as "truly"
democratic or free without facing some deeply
embarrassing questions politics is conceived
of as some ideological system "out there", a col¬
lection of abstractions ("capitalism", "free
market", "Marxism", "oppression", "freedom
of speech", "human rights", representative gov¬
ernment", "electoral system", "checks and bal¬
ances" . . .); and writing a political novel becomes
a form of campaigning, carrying a torch, bran¬
dishing a slogan, leaving the domain of the private
to engage in public debate or action. In South
Africa suffering under the inhuman burden of
apartheid, or taking its first hesitant steps towards
a different and still largely unmapped future
politics forms an integral part of the real and
daily experience, whether individual or collective.
And writing about it subverts the easy tradi¬
tional distinction between private and public. In
a sense the most private experience of all the act
of love between two persons becomes unset-
tlingly public in its implications when it is inserted
into the framework of the abnormal society cre¬
ated and sustained by apartheid. (And even today,
with much of the legal substructure of apartheid
being dismantled, the mentality, the mind-set,
of apartheid creating a sense of superiority in
some, and a sense of being the perpetual victims
in others remains in place.)
THE THREATENING HEART
When I wrote Looking on Darkness in the early
1970s, tracing the fatal relationship between a
"coloured" actor and a young white woman, it
became the first Afrikaans novel to be banned in
South Africa; and apart from "threatening the
security of the state" and "blasphemy" the main
reason advanced for the ban was "pornography".
Because in an abnormal society love itself could
not be allowed a normal place; and because the
love of two people forced by the distorted rea¬
soning of apartheid into two different racial "cat¬
egories" became, through its very existence, an

THE REALM OF LOVE

it be possessed;

interrogation of an implicit attack on the
foundations of the state. There simply is no longer
any line of demarcation between "private" and
"public", between "love" and "politics".
The use of the term "pornography", with
"obscenity" as its synonym, is also significant.
Not only this manifestation of love (across the
colour bar) is regarded as repugnant, offensive and
dangerous, but love itself: in a society which
finds its whole raison d'être in separateness, love
becomes a real threat to hegemony. It is inevitably
obscene: off-scene, against-the-grain, against
everything admitted as acceptable. And to brand
it pornographic reveals more of the mentality
behind the accusation than of the experience or
its written record.
"The French realize that love is a form of
metaphysical enquiry," Lawrence Durrell said
in an interview many years ago (which I used as
an epigraph to an early novel, The Ambassador,
which was also termed pornographic by the
establishment because, this time, it revealed a
human frailty in an official representative of the
South African regime). "The English," added
Durrell, "think it has something to do with the
plumbing." Few remarks illustrate quite so effec¬
tively the distortions of the experience of love by
a system which is threatened by it on all fronts. 11

Which brings us back to the link between the pri¬
vate (love) and the public (politics).
In every novel I have written, in one way or
another the point of departure has been the
inescapable solitude of the individual and the
miracle of those fleeting "instants in the wind" in
which one does reach and touch another. I can
think of no other experience in which both the
tragedy and the miracle of otherness is celebrated
so profoundly as the acknowledgement of love.
And living and writing in South Africa has almost
inevitably involved me in the political dimen¬
sion of otherness expressed in, and by, apartheid.
Once again the transition from personal to public
comes natural to the writer who can use it with
its full metaphoric weight. (There is one crucial
difference between the two experiences, of course,
and this in itself is important: the solitude of the
individual cannot except in those excruciat¬
ingly beautiful and fleeting instants be either
avoided or changed: apartheid can. This very dif¬
ference, with its clear Camusian overtones, illu¬
minates both dimensions.)
A COMMON CELEBRATION
Umberto Eco has wittily and incisively demon¬
strated the dilemma of the postmodernist writer
in his remarks on the impossibility of saying to a
woman "I love you madly", knowing that
Barbara Cartland has already (over)used the
phrase which forces him to resort to irony.
One cannot be flippant about the relation
between love and politics in South Africa; yet the
situation reveals the same need for a different
kind of approach and a mistrust of realism. The
poet Willie Kgotsisile once explained that if he
wants to write a poem about the moon or about
love there is no need for him to dwell on his suf¬
fering under apartheid or in exile: if he chooses the
right words, he said, all the experience of his
whole life will go into his evocation of the moon
or his declaration of love.
What South Africa needs at the moment is,
above all, perhaps, a new language of love. It is rel¬
evant even on the practical level of exiles returning
home to find their relationships with loved
ones wives, husbands, lovers, children, par¬
ents, family, friends strained to breaking point
by the need to reorientate and redefine their lives
within a changing context. (For many, the very
agony of exile provided ironically, terribly the
framework for a relationship which now has to
be adapted to the humdrum urgent needs of
finding a job, choosing a school for the children,
settling in a new community, learning patience
after that euphoric moment of watching Nelson
Mandela leave his prison.)
This may go some way towards defining
some possibilities of a "role" for the writer
(always a notion fraught with danger!) in a
changing South Africa. Apartheid has insisted
on what keeps people apart: the differences, the
alterities, the notions of groups and cultures and
ethnicities. The writer takes as a point of depar¬
ture that which he or she has in common with
others the love, the joy, the hate, the suspicion,
the fear, the ambition, the trust, the faith, the
hope. Apartheid has inscribed inequalities into
our daily lives: the oppression of women, the
degradation of those not marked by a white skin.
The writer can devise the language to break down
these inequalities and transcend differences as a
destructive experience. This would truly have to
be a language of love, and a celebration of love: an
acknowledgement of love, not as pornographic or
obscene or untrustworthy or insidious, but as the
dangerous, profound and illuminating meeting of
self and other.
Only when this happens when love is once
again "at home" in the country, returned from the
exile apartheid has imposed on it, can South
Africa once again join the human family. ^ß

pened, she smiled, patted my head and told me
not to be so upset. It was all nonsense: the impor¬
tant thing was not to know where we came from
but where we were going.
Later on, I learnt that when the family trees of
love-children and ordinary children alike,
whether white, black, yellow, red, coffee-
coloured, albinos or pygmies, are traced back,
they apparently all spring from a common pair of
ancestors, who some people call Adam and Eve
and others monkeys, male and female, though
there are still people who have their doubts.
Later still, I came to understand that, in the
colonial setting, some people looked upon us as
being an embarrassment and others as a threat.
From the books I read, I finally realized that
the term "love-child", though proffered as an
insult, was actually a mark of nobility.
Books taught me that romance cannot be
contained within the framework of marriage,
and that this has been true from the time of
Tristan and Iseult, through Madame Bovary, right
up to Djamilia' and L'Amant.2
IRRESISTIBLE PASSION
My first example is that of Tristan, a Knight of the
Round Table, who is charged with escorting
Iseult, the betrothed of his uncle King Mark, and
who, inadvertently or in a moment of madness,
shares with her a magic potion that kindles in
them an irresistible passion. In short, it is the
story of a man who carries off a bride-to-be on the
eve of her wedding in order to save her from the
hell of a loveless marriage.
My second example is that of the children of
two rival families, the Montagues and Capulets,
who fall in love and are married in secret. But
Romeo has killed a Capulet and has to go into
exile. In order to escape a forced marriage, Juliet
takes a sleeping draught. Romeo thinks she is
dead and kills himself. When Juliet awakes, she
too kills herself. They are model lovers, but they
defy the law and betray their kinsfolk.
In both these examples, love means passion,
a violent outburst whose flames destroy all sense
of reason. The two protagonists prefer death to
the mediocrity of everyday life.
In Apollinaire 's poem Lorelei, the legendary
siren of the river Rhine sings:
My love has left for a far-offland
Let me die, for I have nothing left to love.
Thinking she sees her lover coming, she leans
out over the water, stumbles and falls in. Death is
the only fitting punishment for the unseemly
love of a sorceress.
Madame Bovary's love is that of a woman
taken in adultery. The novel's heroine dies for her
sins and its author was hauled before the courts
for going beyond the bounds of decency and
morality.
As the French poet Louis Aragon1 put it, love
is suffering:
My lovely love, my dearest love, heart¬
rending love 13

/ bear you within me like a wounded bird
There is no such thing as happiness in love"
And yet. . . .
In Mamadou and Binéta, our school reading
primer, I read over and over again the adven¬
tures of Samba who, by killing the "Guinarou",
rid his country, which sounded much like my
own village, of a giant crocodile that had to be
appeased by sacrificing young maidens to it.
The King came up to Samba and said to him:
" You, stranger, have killed the giant crocodile.
You are the bravest ofthe brave. Thanks to you,
we shall always havefresh water. What are your
desires? I shall grant your every wish. "
Samba had been told how the three maidens
had been brought to the crocodile and how the
King's daughter had shown no sign offear.
He then spoke up and said: "Samba has only one
thing to ask ofHis Majesty: the brave Samba seeks
the hand ofthe King's daughter in marriage. "
And so it came to pass. Samba had many chil¬
dren with his wife, and they were alias brave as
theirfather and their mother.
I was captivated by this story, which had been
adapted from a Fulbe Torodo legend. Since then,
I have realized that various versions of this same
story exist the world over in the folk memory,
constructed on the same pattern, with their mix¬
ture of magic, epic deeds and "courtly" love.
Courtly love is the thread that runs through
them and the end that crowns them. In this tale,



unlike the earlier examples I have quoted, love is
not an all-consuming, outlawed passion but is part
and parcel of the order of things and of society. It
is the prize awarded to the conquering heroes
through whose exploits society can continue to
live in the peace of the traditional order. Marriage
should be the beginning of the love story. In fact,
it leads into the end of the tale, which always
goes: "they were married and lived happily ever
after, and had lots of children."
Despite that, it is a long time since I felt
ashamed at being a mwana makangu, a love-
child.
Those who see beyond the confines of the
family circle are by nature allergic to the us-and-
them mentality, and yet I have to ask myself
whether I am not prompted by the reflexes of that
mentality when I rule that the people who live on
the other side of the river, who do not speak the
same language as me, who worship a different
god, whose skin colour, hair texture or shape of
nose are different from mine, are not my fellow
human beings but are barbarians, invaders and
enemies, the offspring of some other species.
Minds capable of being astonished that there
can actually be people like Montesquieu's Persians
are likely to be highly responsive to the ideas of
racism and xenophobia.
STRONGER
THAN FRONTIERS
Can there be said to be ideas about love that bear
the stamp of particular civilizations? The codes
people use to declare and show their love do
quite likely vary from one society to another or
from one group or community to another. Some
take a rather discreet form and are couched in fig¬
urative language, while others are more to the
point, but in all cases it is necessary to know the
proper form to follow, or else the suitor's
advances are liable to be spurned. A hint of emo¬
tion and a touch of poetry are always necessary
in such preliminaries.
If emotion makes the suitor stutter and
stammer, he can always try singing. The first two
words that people listening to Congolese music
learn are bolingo and motéma, love and heart. If
the beloved is not won over by singing, she can be
invited to dance. All folk dances the world over tell

a tale of seduction. The male does his courtship
display and the maiden starts by refusing.
Ways of loving have no doubt evolved
throughout history, especially as regards the rela¬
tionship between lovers. Love is a conquest in



which nothing can ever be taken for granted, but
ever since the beginnings of time the folk memory
has been a treasury of famous songs telling of the
power of love that bestrode national borders and
divisions of religion and race.
Love has nothing to do with the match¬
making between families and clans to which gen¬
erations of young people were subjected so as to
preserve the "purity" of tribes and the cohesion
of social classes. Some societies have been more
clearsighted and have drawn practical conclu¬
sions from this: in their wisdom, they have con¬
tinued to practise polygamy, which is a way of
paying lip service to propriety while offering
scope for passion. In their first marriage, men
yield to the law of the group and found a family
with a first wife (a "queen mother"?) who ensures
the continued survival of the group. But imme¬
diately after that, they are allowed the possibility
of having a favourite among their other wives, a
wife for whose heart and body they long with a
thirst that cannot be quenched in a thousand and

one nights or days or even years. Incidentally,
those societies would have been even wiser had
they thought of combining polygamy and
polyandry. But let us not judge the past with the
eyes and values of the present.
No, I am no longer ashamed of being a love-
child.
I am indeed eternally grateful for that moment
of passion enjoyed by an unknown grandfather
and a grandmother who was later to become the
wise woman of our tribe. As a result of their
temerity in flouting the accepted rules, I have
since the cradle held this truth, that humankind
is one, to be self-evident.
When a love like theirs is sparked off, it brings
to light affinities and sensibilities that transcend
their overt differences. It is love at first sight, but
stormy times lie ahead when two human beings,
in the face of all the hostility of family, society and
religion, proclaim that artificial boundaries are
nonsense and revel in the intermingling of blood
with blood. It is through this cross-fertilization
that the culture of the colonial subject colonizes
that of the colonial master and that the concept of
humankind supersedes that of race.
Love means elective affinities asserting them¬
selves over the solidarity of the group.
LIGHT IN DARKNESS
Although the mixed offspring of these love affairs
have to contend with difficulties and crises in
coming to terms with life, they are the tender
shoots that will later burst into flower, the living
image of men and women of the future.
There may be something significant in the
fact that the love extolled by Aragon, Eluard,
Neruda or Nicolas Guillen is never consum¬
mated in a communal wedding night, between
militants draped in the Red Flag and lying on a
Stakhanovite camp bed. Aragon sings of the love
of the Arab sovereign Boabdil, the Fou d'Eisa, and
Eluard of his love for Nusch, a love that gives him
the strength to believe even in the darkest hour of
the night:
Loving love. The truth is, the light blinds me.
I keep enough of it within me to watch over the
night, all night, every night.
All virgins are different. I always dream of
virgins.*
When the mob, in the name of morality and
God, wants to stone to death the woman taken in
adultery, Christ stays the hand of the Pharisees
and calls on him among them who is without
sin to cast the first stone.
Perhaps it is Jorge Amado who, in almost all
of his novels, has best expressed this deep-seated
link between love and the commingling of races,
both of which are vectors of universal values.
Such commingling, however, should not be taken
as a gift of the gods, but should be regarded as a
heritage, a rich lode to be mined, an opening of the
way to a new life that calls for vigilance, the
highest of standards and a readiness to act at all
times. 9ß 15

### 93732: The Plight of the playboy in early spring

AT the first sign of spring, when the
early flowers timidly open, as soon
as the weather starts to get warmer
and the body feels the first tender touch of the
sun, the women of Paris take to the streets. Not
to demonstrate: unconstrained, free from false
modesty, intelligent yet with a hint of fragility
overcome, they no longer need vindictive
speeches and slogans. They have already won the
battle, not only in Parliament but in the public
mind. They are there to show themselves off,
proud just to be there, free, in the vanguard of
fashion, and with an appetite that is intimidating
or at the least disconcerting to even the most
determined womanizer.
Paris, more than any other European capital,
is their realm, their territory, the stamping ground
of all their desires. The light in this city, particu¬
larly at certain special times of day, enhances not
only their beauty but also and this does not
come amiss their mystery. Tall or petite, dark or
fair, rich or poor, Parisians by birth or by adop¬
tion, they pass by, self-assured, the look in their
eyes hinting to those who know the language
of love and sorrow. They may not be dominating
but they are not averse to becoming so when
their intelligence is affronted.
When a man experiences this he starts feeling
scared. He is convinced that late twentieth-cen¬
tury women are bent on his destruction. In fact
he is not thinking of his own destruction but of
that of all men whose love for women has grad¬
ually become a weakness that puts them severely
to the test nearly every day. The friend in whom
he confides is happy to learn he is not the only one
waging a combat that is lost from the start. The
only serious problem in his life is not suicide or
death but how to go about loving women. He is
completely at a loss to understand the grammar
of women's language a language that is often
foreign to him but he obstinately persists in
his quest.
The playboy's problem is learning to adapt.

women are not becoming any less demanding

would cool his ardour, or at least slow down his
scoring rate. Now, with a packet of condoms in his
pocket he feels more sure of himself and ready for
anything. He knows women are uncompromising
about this, something that often plays havoc with
his libido. Love-making loses some of its charm
when the question of protection crops up; con¬
versation switches tone from beauty to fear, dis¬
tress and death, and the excitement of the first time
together is foregone while the necessary precau¬
tions are worked out. Nevertheless, women have
lost none of their arrogance, which itself has
something erotic about it. Acutely aware of this,
women wage a constant battle to ensure that love
takes precedence over sexual acrobatics. Our
playboy took a long time to understand this.
DREAMS OF FAIR WOMEN
Living with a beautiful métisse, he follows
Stendhal's advice not to see too much of his



beloved and to drink champagne in agreeable
company. He suspects women to be fickle, poor
fellow, but does not always keep the right com¬
pany. For the time being he would rather dream
and is even in danger of becoming imprisoned in
his dreams. He knows dreaming is pleasant but
forgets it is also a trap.
He sees her walking unhurriedly towards
him, caught in a ray of sunshine, tall, taller than
himself, wearing a very tight, short black skirt
on her it looks good because she has fantastic legs.
She walks with the measured but basically natural
elegance of someone out strolling for the pleasure
of it. Her jacket fits closely at the waist, a waist he
can encircle with his two hands. He runs his fin¬
gers through her tousled hair. Beneath her jacket
of a discreet red, her breasts hang free. Around her
neck and over her shoulders she is wearing a
huge cashmere scarf; when she throws it back it
blows a puff of wind into the gawping eyes of the
men. She walks on by without seeing him and he
names her Perfidy, the name of a perfume he
dreams one day of inventing. There is nothing
nasty or even perverse in the name, just a sly
play on words. As she moves away he looks at her
from behind, a perfect picture in her short skirt,
and of course undresses her. She slaps him and he
falls at her feet. She pushes him away. He gets to
his feet, cursing himself as usual for what he has
done. Looking in the mirror he sees she has
scratched him and finds a drop of blood on his
finger. He sucks it and bursts out laughing.
The woman who has just sat down at the
table opposite is a voluptuous creature with big
dark eyes and the expression of a runaway trage¬
dienne, pouting lips and a full bosom. She gazes
into the distance as she drinks her tea and he
pretends to himself she is not there. She goes to
the telephone and he strains to hear what she is
saying. What he hears is unreassuring. She speaks
with an Italian accent and is vowing revenge on
someone. The words are a mixture of tough and
tender: "I love you, my darling, but if I catch 17

..." When she comes back he sees she is crying,
eye shadow running down her cheeks. She
reminds him of an old girlfriend who only blos¬
somed out when they had a big scene. Her name
is Marphysa. He is afraid she will move over to his
table as he feels she is quite capable of doing. He
hastens to pay his bill and scuttles out of the
café.
This one is eighteen, has a goddess's name
and only goes for men of forty. She rings his
doorbell and asks for a light. He notices her
impressively full, firm breasts, her disturbing
grey-green eyes and her hair, worn in Louise
Brooks pageboy style, that he feels a sudden
desire to stroke. He tells himself she's not the
sort to let herself be talked into things, she is
more in need of love, a romance with moments of
tension, surprises and upsets. He doesn't feel up
to involvement in such a romance. He asks.her in
for a cup of tea. She asks a lot of questions that he
answers as best he can. She asks if he would like
to go to the theatre with her. He detests the the¬
atre but smiles and says yes. He tries to persuade
her to go to the cinema instead but she has seen
all the films he was meaning to sec. The thought
that one day she will let him touch her lips with
his gives him the shivers. He looks at her lips.
They are a very bright red and her eyes are
laughing all the time. He names her Anastasia and
he knows she means to destroy him, he is
expecting it and getting ready for it. He knows he
is for the slaughter but doesn't know how or
where it will happen.
ALL-TIME LOSERS
He calls the friend in whom he confides and the
friend confirms his general impression: "I feel the
same way. My intuition tells me it's going to be
awful. Our only hope is to pray for rain: it's
spring that gives them these dreadful ideas. It's
only to be expected: beauty needs to breathe, to
commit a few offences, and we are marked down
as the perfect victims. You tell me about your
Anastasia but I just had a narrow escape from a
knife-thrower! Ruthless, merciless! Georges was
hit on the head with a Coke bottle swept into
his face as his girlfriend threw her scarf over her
shoulder. We're goners and it's just as well we
know it. I thought I was going to turn
Mirabelle still in high school into one of those
brainy creatures with generous mouths who
could be the talk of the town! It turned out she
already had two lovers!"
Models often meet other people in the rag
trade upstairs at the Café de Flore and even have
photo sessions there. The women change clothes
in full view of the customers. There is no
voyeurism involved since there aren't any mys¬
teries or secrets any more. Actresses arrange to
meet people there. Without makeup and in ordi¬
nary clothes they often pass unnoticed. The Flore
is not a place for striking up acquaintances but for
cultivating those made elsewhere. Our man feels
safe here. The girls go by, take their seats, chat,
dress and undress, dance and then disappear.
He likes thinking back to that Brazilian actress
who came to Paris for three weeks to make a
film. The time he spent with her was one of total
insecurity. Their love-making was sublime. The
first time she came to his door, by mistake, she
hesitated on the doorstep then, with an accent that
sent him into a spin, said: "Aren't you Skolawsky ?
Can I use your phone?" She put down her bag,
took off her coat and lit a cigarette as she dialled
the number. He took in her perfect figure, her
mane of hair, her wide, graceful gestures. The
number did not answer.
"Could I have a glass of water? I get thirsty
when there's no-one there."
"Wouldn't you rather have a glass of white
wine?
"No, we don't know each other well enough
to drink wine together."
"We've got to start sometime	"
"When I feel like it, not before."

### 380082: Don Juan and the quest for the absolute

ü
ZEINA ÁRIDA,
of Lebanon, is preparing a
thesis on women in the plays
of Henry de Montherlant.



Don Juan and the
quest for the absolute
byZeinaArida
DONJUAN first saw the light of day in 1630,
when Baroque theatre was in full flower
and behind the rigid morality of Spanish
society there lurked a sometimes unbridled liber¬
tinism. In El burlador de Sevilla (The seducer of
Seville), Tirso de Molina created the character and
traced the outlines of his destiny. The hero of this
drama, the irresistible womanizer, took on a life of
his own that has lasted nearly four centuries, going
on from one literary incarnation to another, from
author to author, as if belonging to all and to none.
A born libertine, Don Juan moves from one
amorous adventure to another, exploiting his social
rank to deceive women. Living only for the
moment, he opts for time rather than eternity, for
change rather than immutability. In this world of the
fleeting instant, libertinism in love is a natural con¬
sequence of the instability of all things: any man
who follows the devices and desires of his heart
becomes inconstant in love. Inconstancy, the refusal
to worship at the shrine of the one and only love,
becomes a duty. Not only does Don Juan feel no
attachment to any woman, the attachment felt by
any woman for him would be a burden to him.
Faithfulness to beauty is the only form of fidelity
possible in love.
Tormented and forever unsatisfied, Donjuán
is at the same time an angst-ridden figure. Some
would have it that he is not seeking love or ten¬
derness but trying to assuage a desire that is impos
sible to satisfy and hence is constantly rekindled.
His desires come up against the limitations of sated
lust, and the whole world becomes the playground
for his amorous propensities. As Molière's Dom
Juan puts it, "I would there were other worlds so
I could extend to them my amorous conquests."
The seducer needs obstacles. Seduction means
overcoming obstacles: the harder the woman is to
get, the more desirable she is. It thus comes about
that, in Pascal's words, he prefers the combat to the
victory. Once his victim surrenders, he loses interest
and spurns her.
In nineteenth-century Romanticism, the
wanton, cynical libertine was to give way to the
seeker after the Ewig-Weibliehe, the Eternal
Feminine, the sister-soul on whom his heart will be
set. Behind the staggering record of the seducer's
winning streak the "thousand and three" women
of Mozart's Don Giovanni there lies a quest for the
absolute. Don Juan becomes a Faust-figure, and
his infidelity, according to Alfred de Musset,
becomes "a craving for the infinite in the pleasure
of the senses".
Inconstant though he may be, he is nevertheless
always sincere. In each instance he is in love, and for
the short moment he loves a woman she becomes
the one and only, until he moves on to the next. Don
Juan does not betray love, love always eludes him,
perhaps because he has never encountered the
amourfou so dear to André Breton.
Of Don Juan's many attributes, it is to that of
the hungry hunter, the pleasure-seeker, that the
modern age is most drawn. Some writers, such as
Henry de Montherlant, have imagined him in dis¬
illusioned old age, pushing the depiction to the
limits of caricature: "The Don Juans of old were
damned souls; this one is sex-obsessed, and thus
very much of our time." m

Three days later she was back, with a bottle of
champagne, just like in the movies. The first time
they made love they did it standing up, like in the
movies. She said: "You're not French, you must
be a white-skinned African." He said: "No, I'm
a Parisian."
Love as in a novel, a film, an old song, love like
a misty, dewy morning, bashful as a crime of
passion, crazy like a mirror that has forgotten
how to reflect, in Paris love sometimes wears
the face of pain, of disconsolate grief, he told
himself as he thought of all those women, those
lovely, willing, wanton, deadly women, who
stroll beside the Seine and will be sleeping alone
tonight. He starts to reckon up, to work out the
statistics, then realizes that at the very moment he
is working them out a woman is having the
orgasm of her life, so strong and wild she loses
control and strangles her lover.
When she makes love she closes her eyes and
speaks a mixture of Portuguese and Spanish. She
asks him to talk to her in Arabic, saying: "That's
how you make love in Paris, in several languages."
When the film was completed she stayed on a few
days, shutting herself up with him in a small
hotel, offering herself up entirely to him. She cut
off a lock of his hair, like a teenager, stuck it on a
postcard and sent it to him with the message:
"Only in Paris do I have orgasms that make me
pass out. You may be partly responsible, but get
it into your head that it's the polluted Paris air that
really turns me on."
He was a long time getting over that strictly
sexual affair. Sitting now at an outdoor café table,
he watches, aloof, as the girls go by. They are all
different, gathered in from distant climes. The
African girls he admires for their firm breasts,
their outspokenness, forwardness and feistiness,
the Asians for their willowy figures. He knows
how North African girls indulge their rampant lust
once they have started to become emancipated, and
he appreciates their wilfulness and the intelligence
that goes with their passion. What he likes best in
Frenchwomen is the playful siren-song and light
in their eyes. He is in love with all women, in
love forever and always the loser. 9ß

OVE, indecipherable love. Every generation
has tried to give it a local habitation and a
Iname but it has escaped unscathed and
entire, like children and like mystery. Some have
seen a little of its light and darkness. Heroes,
saints and poets throughout history and the
world over have endeavoured to express it and
perished in the flames. I tried encamping in the
wilderness of words with my language's most
authoritative dictionary, that of the Spanish Royal
Academy, finding good grazing there for expres¬
sions both commonplace and outlandish, my
own and other people's.
In my odyssey I learned only that everyone
has something to say on the subject and that
anything goes, from feelings, real or imagined, to
the passion that draws one sex to the other, by
way of caresses and not forgetting the chubby,
naked, winged babe with the quiverful of arrows.
I shipwrecked on passion and came upon suf¬
fering, turmoil and disorder, encountered rapture
and discovered ecstasy, sin and delirium, mystical
union with God, swooning and trance-like states.
I saw eyes rolling heavenwards and levitating
female saints, and I caught a whiff of stylites
perched on top of their columns, like storks only
much less graceful and good-humoured.
The expressions used to describe amorous
rapture reinforce one another. It is a comet that
draws along in its ancient orbit all the possible and
impossible forms of love. Thus, the language of
the people, a sure source of wisdom, has it that
when we reach sexual climax, however briefly, in
and with one another, we are transported to the
seventh heaven, to the highest heaven, as if six
were not enough and as if to speak of love it
were necessary to invoke the number seven,
which is in all cultures the peerless, most perfect
of numbers. No wonder that the verb to love is,
in our grammars, the model, the verbal para¬
digm, the word among words. It is only in love's
presence and under its sway that we glimpse

veil; but to my knowledge no-one who has
glimpsed the innermost recesses of heaven or
earth or hell has ever returned to tell the tale. If
Lazarus could not, why should we demand it of
lovers, anchorites or artists?
And yet the latter have given us an answer, in
their own ways and as best they could. Sometimes
words, despite the vastness of their domain, are
inadequate to the task, and then other voices
must be borrowed, other wise men followed to
reach journey's end. The rarest of rare birds is he
who has succeeded in expressing love in its
entirety, deploying sounds and silences to encom¬
pass heaven, hell and earth and tame the senses.
The only one to so succeed, I believe, was is
Mozart. How strange, though, that his greatest
success should be Don Giovanni, in which he tells
the tragic story of one who is incapable of giving,
disabled in love, afflicted by an unquenchable
thirst.
Others, like Marc Chagall in his Doublepor¬



trait with a glass of wine dated, significantly,
1917/1918 have managed to capture through
ephemeral images the most perfect of human
desires, that for requited, equal, unstinted,
unending love. Chagall painted this masterpiece
while the world was engaged in perpetrating the
assorted atrocities that accompany all wars. Yet
again, Europe was plunged in bloody internecine
struggles, this time dragging the world into the
terrible conflict known as the Great War.
But Bela, the beautiful bride, is dressed in
white, between her impatiently swelling breasts
nestles a brooch embossed with hope, and she
steps forward defiantly. The city's domes and its
mean, dark dwellings are left behind, and the
dreary landscape dons its finest colours as she
passes by. One gloved hand conceals her wedding
ring and the other holds a fan of green leaves and
garnet-red flowers. Her body is slim and graceful
but her step is resolute. A slit in the skirt of her
dress reveals a well-turned leg, sheathed in a long
stocking of a provocative violet colour. Her shoes
are comfortable, suitable for the long road of life.
She no longer wears the veil of maidenhood. The
vessel has slipped its moorings, the daydreams fade
and the thick mists lift, the inexpressible bonds
between reality and heart's desire are tightened.

### 93733: Double portrait with a glass of wine

Double portrait with a glass of wine
(191 7-19 1 8),
by Marc Chagall, oil on canvas.
Her hair is worn in a style that is slightly ahead
of its time the age of the Charleston has not yet
come. The composition, the present and the
future, are centred on the single eye, liquid and full
of emotion and confidence.
Slippered and astride her shoulders, the young
groom also advances towards the observer, car¬
ried away with joy, drunk on love. He is dressed
in green, with a red coat green the colour of idle
dreams, red the colour of anger, of spilt blood, but
also, among the Chinese, the colour of happiness.
The glass is half-supped: the lovers have
already drunk a toast. Now they will smash it to
the ground, committing to the earth the sharp
splinters of their sorrows. The lovers have been
caught at the very moment, the decisive moment,
when the soul is in touch with the ineffable. An
angel hovers protectively over them, floating on
a cloud of green, the bridegroom's colour, with
robe and wings of the same violet as the bride's
stocking.
The bride turns a deaf ear to all words, to the
dread Stygian ferryman who takes only one pas¬
senger at a time and to the deadly song of the
sirens; she is borne along by the inexplicable
force that works miracles. She shows that one of
the deepest, most secret of our recurrent dreams
is not impossible: she flies without burning her
wings, she glides lightly over the water like a
goddess and walks unharmed on the burning
coals of the past.
Requited love, the one and only moment
when separateness is overcome, and the two who
are now one become three, resolving, perhaps, the
abiding mystery of the Trinity. Those who have
tasted that moment have already forgotten it.
Epilogue: And so Bela and Chagall set off
into the wide world to seek their fortune, to con¬
quer Paris. And, as the story goes, they married,
had lots of children and lived happily ever after.
Marc filled the world with lovers, flying cows and
fiddlers on roofs, at other times depicting
mourners and graveyards somehow unjust,
like all graveyards.
Now, at the turn of the millennium, floun¬
dering in the same iniquitous, fratricidal con¬
flicts, when lovers no longer have a New World
to discover and there is no hiding-place for them
in cities where we look, powerless, upon the
scourges they are prey to, we would do well to
find some place for Bela, her young husband,
their children and the angel, a place where we can
all raise the half-supped glass and drink a toast: to
the bride, to life. 9ß 21

From France, with love

IN the night I call your name, Oriya my wife,
and you, Samira, Jámila and Ali, my dear
children. I have begun with your name, and
it is with your name that I shall end, Oriya my
wife, because you are the woman I love more than
anything in the world. When I left Tata three
years ago, when I left all I had loved and known
since my birth, my parents' home, I had nothing
to take away with me. We were so poor that I had
to leave. I took what was most precious to me:
your names, yours above all, Oriya. It is a very
sweet name, I repeat it every day and every night.
Your name gives me strength, it makes me work,
it bestows a blessing on me.
Oriya, your name stirs me and fills me with
happiness whenever I utter it. It is deep within me,
it has entered the innermost part of my body,
sometimes it feels as if I have been hearing it all my
life. Every evening, when I come back tired from
Guiglione's building site, I enter the room in the
Rue d'Italie which I share with Malik, the
Tunisian, and I stretch out on the mattress. I no
longer hear the sound of the television set, I do
not see the blue light flickering in the room, nor
those meaningless images, those images that you,
Oriya, will never be part of. Malik watches tele¬
vision until he drops off to sleep. He does not talk,
he watches everything sport, films, quizzes,
talk-shows, everything I sometimes think he is
going to go mad.
I close my eyes as I lie on the mattress by the
window, and you, Oriya, appear before me. Malik
cannot see you. I am the only person who can see
you in this poky room, because your name is
written deep within me and because I am waiting
for the day when I can be with you again. Your
name is written in a very long sentence, a never-
ending sentence that is moving slowly towards

you, towards the other side of the world where
you are waiting for me. So I can see you.
I am so far from you all, in this city, in this
room. Up here under the roof, it is cold in winter
and stifling in summer. Our mattresses are laid out
on the floor. Malik has the mattress near the
door, and mine is near the window. In the middle
there is Slimane's mattress. A week ago Slimane,
Malik's brother, was crushed by a wall that had
not been shored up properly on the site. He lost
his right arm. He will not be able to work again.
When he gets out of hospital, he will go back to
his wife and children in Tunisia. Malik at least
talked about that, then went on watching televi¬
sion, his face full of anger. I could not help won¬
dering what you would say, Oriya, if the same
thing happened to me, if I came back home
maimed. What would our children say?
I like sleeping by the window. On spring
mornings I can guess what the weather is going
to be like. I can hear the swifts screeching. It is
almost as if I can see a little of the light of Tata, the
light that you see with your eyes, Oriya.
Tata. I like saying that name too. It's a name
that makes the people here laugh. They do not
understand it. I lower my voice apologetically

when 1 say it because they find it funny, to let
them know that I cannot do anything about it. It
is a very sweet name, a name like yours, Oriya,
which gives me life and strength. I also say to
myself the familiar names of the villages and the
markets. They are like the names of my family.
Souk lleta, Tazart, El Khcmis, Aiggo, Imitck. I say
them with my eyes shut, and I am close to you,
Oriya, even if my hands cannot touch you, even
if I do not eat your bread or drink your water.
I can see your smile, I can hear the murmur of
your voice in my ear, as you sing a lullaby to
our son, whom I have not yet seen. I can see the
sparkle of your eyes held captive by your kohl-
paintcd eyelids, I can smell the scent of your hair
as you comb it in the morning sun in the women's
courtyard. I can see you just as I used to do when
I peeped at you through the curtains of the
window in the men's chamber.
The seasons have come and gone, far from
you, Oriya, far from you, my children. In win¬
tertime, it is so cold on the building sites that
only the memory of you, Oriya, and the memory
of your voice and your eyes keep me alive. For
you I lay row upon row of twenty-centimctrc-
thick breeze blocks, I pour concrete over rusty 23

rods, I drive screws into ceiling joists, I smooth
plaster on walls. My name is Abdelhak, my
father's name is Rebbo, and my mother is
Khadidja. Guiglione, our boss, can never
remember my name, or does not want to. He
calls me Ahmed. All the labourers on the site are
called Ahmed. What does it matter? It is for you
I heave the shovel, for you I tip the cement and
build breeze-block walls. Day after day, month
after month I build walls, I smooth plaster. I have
built more houses than all the families of Tata
would need. I have built whole towns. When I
have saved up enough money, I shall return, Oriya,
and we shall never again be far from each other.
The sun burns my body, the cold sears my
skin, and my arms and legs are breaking from the
weight of shovelful after shovelful. I am used to
it now. When I came to this city three years ago,
I was still as frail and tender as a child. By evening
I would be so tired and so lonely that I would lie
on the floor and let the tears pour from my eyes.
I lived in a dormitory with blacks and Tunisians
above a bar, and the neon lights made a bloody
stain on the window. There was the noise of cars
in the street, the voices of drunken men quar¬
relling, of women screaming. There were no chil¬
dren, there was no sweetness. It was then that I
began to call your name, Oriya, and the names of
each of my children, and the name of Tata.
It was then that the memory of the day I met
you came back to me, Oriya my wife, in the
great palm grove by the river, the day of the fes¬
tival when you were part of the procession of
young girls who came to carry the pollen to the
date-palm flowers.
The air was light, I remember it well, and the
golden dust floated heavenwards. The valley
resounded with singing. As the procession passed
in front of me, I saw you, Oriya, and the sparkle
of your eyes entered me, never to re-emerge. I
knew you were my wife.
In the grey and white winter of the building
sites, in this city so far away from you, the memory
of that day is ever-present. It is that memory that
gives me strength, that carries my shovel, that lifts
the heavy loads of cement and plaster.
Even when there is a great silence, even when
there is no smile and no word, just Guiglione's
orders carrying across the site, and the noise of
drills, disk-cutters and jackhammers, and the .
squeak of pulleys hoisting up yet more cement,
yet more plaster, even when there are empty
Sundays on the dusty boulevards, the lonely,
childless, fear-stalked esplanades where evil men
look out for victims, the memory of that day in
the valley of date palms is always with me. It is
you I see, Oriya. You are wearing your finery,
your face and hands are covered with golden
pollen, and the sparkle in your eyes enters my
eyes, for the rest of our days. 9ß

THE UNESCO COURIER - APRIL 1993
by France Bequette
The International Conference on
Nutrition, the first "world nutrition
summit", was held in Romefrom 5 to 11
December 1992. The six-day meeting of
official representatives from over 160
countries, including several ministers of
health and agriculture, wasjointlyspon¬
sored by the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the
World Health Organization (WHO) and
was also attended by around 160 inter¬
national and non-governmental organi¬
zations. It ended with the adoption ofa
WorldDeclaration and a Plan ofAction to
eradicate hunger and malnutrition.
ORLD hunger is a scandal that
cannot be tolerated. There is
enough food in the world for
everyone; the problem is one
of inequitable access. In developing
countries, some 20 per cent of the
population about 780 million
people still do not get enough food
to meet their basic daily needs for
nutritional well-being. About 190
million children under five years of
age suffer from protein-energy mal¬
nutrition and more than two billion
people suffer from micronutrient
deficiencies that can lead to blind¬
ness, mental retardation and even
death.
Agriculture should be able to meet
everybody's food needs but, whereas
the civilizations of the past were
mainly rural and families raised and
grew at least enough for their own
consumption, the millions ofpeople
who throng the world's megacities
today are cut off from the land. In his
book Earth in the Balance, U.S. Vice-
President AI Gore writes: "The his¬
tory of agriculture is intertwined

settlements was accompanied by
further sophistication in the co¬
operative effort to produce, store
and distribute ever-larger quanti¬
ties of food. New technologies, like
the plough and the irrigation ditch,
led to new abundance but also new
problems, like soil erosion and the
buildup of salt in the soil."
New technologies can turn out to
be disastrous, as Al Gore points out:
"The high yield methods frequently
used in the American Midwest
loosen and over time pulverize the
soil to the point that large amounts
of topsoil wash away with each rain,
a process that leads inevitably to a
sharp reduction in the ability of
future generations to grow similar
quantities of food from the same
land."
Moreover, as the number ofpeople
working the land is constantly dwin¬
dling, farming has to become inten¬
sive, producing as much as possible
to feed a steadily growing popula¬
tion while remaining cost-effective.
By the end of the century, the
world's population will have reached
over 6 billion and could level off at
around 1 1 and a half billion in 2 100,
only 13 per cent of whom will be
living in the "rich" countries. This
means farming more land or increas¬
ing yields. At present, according to a
publication by the International
Group of National Associations of
Manufacturers of Agrochemical
Products (GIFAP), 97 per cent of the
world's output of agricultural pro¬
duce is grown on 3 per cent of the
land. Over the next 50 years, we will
have to produce as much food as has
been produced since the first human
beings appeared on Earth, making it
essential to maintain high produc¬
tivity in the rich countries and to
develop a productive agriculture in
the rest of the world.
Pesticides:for and against
According to Professor Adolf
Weber, of the University of Kiel,
Germany, "increased food produc¬
tion relies on the steady flow and
uptake of scientific and technolog¬
ical advances. These can bring more
land into production and increase
the productivity ofagricultural land.
Land improvement methods,
power, machinery, irrigation, seeds,
fertilizers and crop protection prod¬
ucts all play a part. It is generally
26
cheaper to intensify production
rather than extend the land area
under cultivation."
The aim of agrochemistry is to
protect crops and promote soil fer¬
tility. Here, we shall consider only
pesticides. Plants are said to be
threatened by over 15,000 species
ofharmful fungi, over 10,000 species
of harmful insects and over 2,000
species of weeds, not to mention
viruses, bacteria, rodents, and so on.
For each type of enemy, there is a
class ofproducts, ofwhich the main
three are insecticides, herbicides (or
weed-killers) and fungicides; other
categories include slug killers, roden-
ticides, and so on.
Philippe Desbrosses, an environ¬
mentalist working with the
Commission of the European
Communities and the European
Parliament, has pointed out that
world sales of pesticides have long
been regarded as indispensable to
progress in crop protection.
Proponents of "biological" farming
would strongly disagree with the
need for pesticides, holding that
nature needs no help in defending
itself against predators. Green Fields,
Grey Future, a report published by
Greenpeace in 1992, revealed that
EEC member states, taken together,
are the largest users ofpesticides in
the world, with a consumption of
over 314 million tonnes in 1991.
When a farmer sees mildew or
Colorado beetles attacking his
potato or tomato field, and ifhe can
afford it, it is tempting for him to
resort to crop protection products. A
few judicious applications will guar¬
antee a good harvest, but what about
the impact on health and the envi¬
ronment?
Public opinion in the industrial¬
ized countries is becoming increas¬
ingly alarmed about the systematic
use of pesticides, which is seen as
increasing the risk of cancer. In 1989,
a pesticide called Alar, used to treat
apples, was cited in the United States
as presenting a health hazard for

Zealand).
children and set off a major scare.
However, according to Professor
Maurice Tubiana, an internationally
known cancer specialist, "if the fre¬
quent presence in food offertilizers,
herbicides, insecticides, and so on,
had any noticeable carcinogenic
effect, an increase in the incidence of
stomach cancer should have been
observed, since the stomach is the
first of the viscera to be exposed to
risks from food. The rapid and reg¬
ular decline of stomach cancer in
Western countries shows that this
is not the case." Nevertheless,
according to data compiled by the
World Health Organization, about
50,000 people die every year, and
500,000 are poisoned, as a result of
pesticides, through their inhalation
or ingestion or through skin contact.
The developing countries, where
substances thathave been banned in
developed countries are still on the
market, are particularly affected
because, while certain products are
identified as potentially lethal, either
they are not clearly labelled, or users
are illiterate and cannot read the
instructions, do not wear protective
clothing, are not able to shower, or
have no medical care available in
the event ofaccidents.
Alternatives to chemical
control
Manufacturers point out that, just
as for medicaments, every such
product has to obtain clearance from
the public authorities before it can
be sold. According to a statement
from one group ofmanufacturers, in
France this requires "a total ofeight
to ten years of experimentation,
research and studies . . . costing from
600 to 700 million francs." It goes on
to say that "Toxicological testing is
done on animals, microorganisms,
game, aquatic fauna, birds, bees, the
soil and flora ... in order to assess as
accurately as possible the likely
effects on humans and on the envi¬
ronment." It adds that "the risk factor
is never zero, whether the substance
absorbed is kitchen salt, aspirin or
the residue ofa product used to pro¬
tect plants." A brochure published by
the Swiss Federal Office for the
Environment, Forests and the
Countryside about new legislation
on the use ofproducts to treat plants
explains: "The law . . . applies to all
substances which, even ifabsorbed
in relatively small quantities, can be
dangerous to life or health through
a chemical or chemical-physical

must be handled with particular

ment products are toxic!"
In 1948, the Swiss chemist Paul
Müller was awarded the Nobel Prize
for Physiology and Medicine for
having discovered the insecticidal
properties ofDDT, a miracle product
that would help check famine and
diseases such as malaria. A
Canadian government publication,
The State ofCanada's Environment
(1991), indicates that within a dozen
years proof of the harmful effects
and residual persistence of DDT
began to build up. In the early 1970s,
when its dangerous nature had been
clearly and irrefutably established, it
was partially or completely banned
in many countries, including
Canada, but it is still available in
developing countries.

This example calls for several
observations. It can take a while to
determine the real toxicity of a sub¬
stance and years to have it banned.
Once it finds its way into the son, it is
sometimes still found there decades
after itwas used. It can also be found
in surface waters. According to some
specialists, 432 parasite insects were
resistant to insecticides in 1980, as
compared with 7 in 1937.
Can the world be fed without the
use of chemical products? China,
which cannot afford to buy them,
feeds nearly fourteen people from
every hectare of farmland, while
France feeds only two. Referring to
the most comprehensive study ever
done on the subject, carried out in
1991 by Cornell University, AI Gore
writes: "... farmers who used natural
alternatives to chemical control of
pests (such as integrated pest man¬
agement and crop rotation) could
abandon many pesticides and her¬
bicides without reducing yields at
all and without significant increases
in the price of food. And according to
the study, in the case of those pesti¬
cides for which no substitute has yet
been identified, the volume ofchem¬
icals used could, in most cases, safely
be cut in half."
To allaypublic apprehensions, the
main requirement is that environ¬
mentalists and industrialists should
agree to get together and talk.

PAPER RECYCLING-
A BIG MISTAKE?
According to Sten Nilsson, leader
of the Forest Resources Project at
the International Institute for
Applied Systems Analysis in Vienna,
recycling vast amounts of paper
could do more harm than good to
the environment. Recycling paper
has obvious environmental and
economic benefits it limits the
growth of landfills, and making new
paper from waste paper requires
less energy than using new wood
fibres. Professor Nilsson notes, how¬
ever, that "ifwe were to recycle alloi
our paper products the net effect
would be to increase air pollution
and consumption of fossil fuels."
The resultant increase in airborne
emissions of carbon dioxide, sul¬
phur dioxide and nitrogen oxides
would be disastrous for many of
Europe's forests proving once
more that, where the environment
is concerned, there are no quick
fixes. H
LARVAE AND FUNGI WITH A
WEAKNESS FOR NARCOTICS
According to a 1990 United Nations
report, the illicit production and
consumption of drugs are still
increasing at a rapid rate, repre¬
senting a major problem. Is there
any environmentally-friendly way
of eliminating the coca shrub, the
opium poppy and the cannabis
plant? The caterpillars of certain
lepidopterous insects eat coca
leaves and thus constitute a valu¬
able weapon. Certain fungi attack
plants from which narcotics are
derived. More than 40 species are
found on cannabis and coca plants,
and more than 30 on the opium
poppy. Several of these could turn
out to be effective biological control
agents and could be used in eradi¬
cation programmes.
THE ARCTIC-A NUCLEAR
DUMP?
An international conference on envi¬
ronmental problems in the Arctic
was held in Arkhangelsk in October
1992. Participants learned that in
1955 the Soviets had established an
atomic test site on the island of
Novaya Zemlya, between the Barents
Sea and the Kara Sea, and carried
out tests there, first atmospheric then
underground, until 1990. Novaya
Zemlya and its coastal waters have
also become a dumping-ground for
11,000 containers of nuclear waste
and at least 20 nuclear reactors of
various origins, with more to come as
a result of disarmament. This is
causing alarm in Norway as well as
among the local population. The
International Atomic EnergyAgency
has recommended that a strictly
controlled storage facility and repro¬
cessing plant be set up there, but
nobody knows who will foot the bill.
CULTIVATING RED CORAL
Unlike reef-building warm-water coral, which requires substantial amounts
ofsunlight, red coral (Corallium rubrum), the kind used in jewellery, grows
in the shade of caves. Because of its market value it is in danger of over-
exploitation, especially where it grows in shallow water. This, along with its
total disappearance from some areas, has led the General Fisheries Council
for the Mediterranean to approve an interesting new method for culti¬
vating it. Four eight-tonne concrete "caves" were built, then sunk in a
marine reserve offshore from the Monaco Océanographie Institute. Coral
colonies and branches were then transplanted on to artificial substrata fixed
to the walls. The coral has stood up well to the move and has grown 15 mm
in two years, a very rapid growth rate for the species. If the success of this
experiment is confirmed, the same method could be employed in the
areas where the coral has disappeared.

THE GREENING
OF NEW CALEDONIA'S MINES
Each year four million tonnes of nickel are extracted in
the French territory ofNew Caledonia, making the island
the world's third largest producer. The local authorities,
in association with ORSTOM, the French research and
overseas development agency, have launched a research
programme with a view to rehabilitating former mining
sites. The sites are bare and inhospitable, with little
water, few fertilizing elements, and too much magnesium
and nickel. Only species native to the island are capable
of adapting to these conditions. In accordance with an
agreement between ORSTOM, the International
Cooperation Centre of Agricultural Research for
Development (CIRAD), and the South Province of New
Caledonia, about twenty endogenous species ofherba¬
ceous and ligneous plants have been selected to restore
a protective cover ofdiverse vegetation, toning in with the
landscape. By avoiding the introduction ofalien species,
a move which has been responsible for destructive plant
invasions on other Pacific islands, the plan sets an
example of respect for the local environment.
BATTLING BACTERIA

Dirty, stagnant water is a happy hunting ground for
Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes, which are a serious

financed by the Tropical Disease Research Programme
of the World Health Organization has enabled ento¬
mologists to try out new countermeasures in Yaounde
and Maroua. Instead of using chemical insecticides,
which are harmful to the environment and to which
insects develop resistance, they use Bacillus sphericus
bacteria, which kill the mosquito larvae when they
ingest them. This technique produces excellent results
and is both totally harmless and relatively inexpensive.

collecting and disposing of industrial solid waste.
Metropolitan Belo Horizonte is plagued by uncon¬

### 93735: The Enchanted garden

René Depestre
The enchantedgarden
In the land of Eros,
a painting by the Haitian
artist Blaise Saint Louis
THERE is a warm-blooded, pagan side to
my Caribbean character that immedi¬
ately sets my vision of love poles apart
from the gloomy experience that has coloured
the history of Eros in the Western world. That
existential gloom no doubt accounts for the feel¬
ings of shame, sadness and guilt in relation to
sexual activity that pornography helps to keep
alive, at the expense of the frank and free celebra¬
tion of the act of love.
In the Caribbean, the same sense of the won
derful within the day-to-day that characterizes the
Americas and is one of the hallmarks of the
Creole sensibility also makes its beneficent influ¬
ence felt in a relaxed attitude to the pleasures of
sex: the gods themselves make love freely, and the
enjoyment of the sexual act is the occasion for a
pagan ceremony, free from anxiety and the pangs
of religious conscience, and far removed from so-
called "porn", which is nothing other than the
crudity and obscenity of that diabolical killjoy, the
lout.

In my preferred erotic culture, the woman



achieves fulfilment in a paradise garden, clasped
in the arms of the enchanter, a gardener whose
spade thrusts and turns passionately in the inner¬
most parts of her adorable body. On this level, an
embrace has wings to carry lovers boldly onward,
joyously spiralling upward to the seventh heaven
of living. It is in these lyrical, dream-like terms
that, ever since I was an adolescent, I have expe¬
rienced the act of love, thus keeping faith with the
dream state that seems to be the main undercur¬
rent of the Haitian sensibility.
On the plantation in colonial days, sexual
diversions were perhaps the only form of freedom
allowed to my slave ancestors, the freedom to
dance out their loneliness and forget for a while
their unhappiness, offering up their flesh with a
burning intensity. This erotic heritage does not
simply reproduce former patterns of African or
French sexuality: there is without a doubt a Creole
flavour to eroticism in the Caribbean, just as there
is, in our bedroom exploits, a fanciful sexual sur¬
realism, with a spicy Creole seasoning, that existed
long before the literary movement that André
Breton, Philippe Soupault, Louis Aragon, Paul
Eluard and their circle made famous in Europe.
By rehabilitating the superb concept oí amour
fou or sublime love in European culture, the
Surrealists to their credit restored to love-making
both its romantic dimension and a marvellous
freedom in the employment of the intimate parts
involved in bringing it to its glorious fulfilment.
This represented a resounding break with the
Judxo-Christian view of sexuality (which brings
a taste of doom to the pure wine of copulation).
The Surrealists also gave pride of place to lib¬
ertinage in love, but I must confess that, reading
the works of glittering libertines such as Restif de
la Bretonne, Aretino, the Chevalier de Nerciat,
Mirabeau, Choderlos de Laclos, Sade, Casanova
and the rest, I feel a kind of nagging discomfort.
Though they undeniably contributed to the
progress of the Enlightenment and of democ¬
racy by secularizing the right to pleasure, these
books leave an aftertaste of guilt. A grim erotic
self-awareness often slips into the beds of lovers
apparently well suited to happy, innocent, care¬
free love, and a pall of ultimate disenchantment
hangs over the boldest love-making.
In the libertine tradition, sexual pleasure seems
still to have something smutty, lubricious or even
fetid about it, a murky aura of sinfulness that
pornography has been quick to take over and
incorporate into its nasty arsenal. Eros seems to
be under constant threat from.Thanatos: the
familiar post-coîtàl sadness plunges the carefree
couple into a mood of melancholy and contrition.
The grim figure of mortal sin that two or
more had come together to drive out of the
door has the impudence to reappear through the
open window, a slobbering voyeur toting a
shotgun and wearing a death's-head mask!

heartedly cast aside any sense of sin, leaving it to
die of hunger and thirst outside their door while
they make love like free and independent beings,
remaking the seasons, the stars and the whole
beautiful world in a shared state of poetic ecstasy.
I belong to an erotic culture that owes alle¬
giance to yEschylus, who once proclaimed "the
joy of holy Heaven as it penetrates the Earth", the
joy of the male instrument, the ploughshare, as it
plunges for minutes on end, minutes of tremen¬
dous bliss, into the yielding female earth,
romping, dreaming, laughing, revelling, climaxing
in the gratified flesh that fully participates in its
pleasure. Experienced thus in shared jubilation,
the act of love enables Adam's rod and Eve's
starry triangle to laugh out loud in the face of
death!
In this blessed realm, there was for a long
time a paradoxical situation in Haiti. In the oral
culture, Haiti's version of the Creole tradition, the
imagination was given an utterly free rein in mat¬
ters of love-making and eroticism. Haitian erotic
tales overflow with humour, ingenuity and lyri¬
cism, and their language is as joyfully unre¬
strained as the exuberant, magical art of Haiti's
naive painters. Strangely enough, it was, on the
other hand, some time before a similar exuberance
of tone and movement manifested itself in our
French-language literature. It was not until
Jacques Roumains Gouverneurs de la rosée (1944)
and Compère général soleil (1955) by Jacques
Stephen Alexis that young lovers' contagious
enjoyment of carnality entered the novel.
It is high time, good gentlefolk, as normal
men and women, to restore to the celebration of
love its dream configuration. In an age over¬
shadowed by the tragic threat of Aids, it is more
than ever necessary to counter all those who
have declared war on love with a lust for life that
is careful and gentle in its erotic manifestations.
Lovers must be free to enrich their amatory expe¬
rience with all the spiritual and physical delights
that contribute to the well-rounded fullness of
dreams.



All that now lies between us and the garden
that is woman, the celebration of the mystery of
her ample forms, is a river of light that I beckon
you to wade across with eyes closed. Transcending
the dogmas that divide them, whether in Brazil or
Sweden, Japan or Italy, in India or in Haiti, every¬
where on Earth, the gods who hold the secrets of
the art of living are well pleased by the warm,
round shape of love, which is why, in the begin¬
ning, in their collective wisdom they decided to
bestow the gift of roundness on the Sun, the cir¬
cling dance, the Moon, the harvests, the flight of
swallows, the movement of the tides, beds, a
summer evening's grass, blissful intercourse and
the other marvels of our fleeting existence.
What messiah could contradict this without
denying the redeeming worth and eternal beauty
of the carnal act, to which, gods and mortals
alike, we owe the poetry and music of our daily
lives? 9ß 33

N late afternoon I would take refuge on a bal¬
cony overlooking a very quiet little street,
closed to traffic, forgotten by passers-by.
Released from the four walls of the apartment,
isolated from the rest of the household, I cut
myself off from friends and could see, sitting on
the tiles still warm from the sun, a corner of the
summer sky taking on its fiery colours.
I had two stacks of magazines bought by my
father to keep me company. He had recently
given me permission to read them. The magazines
in the first pile dealt with theoretical, abstract
topics that had little appeal for a ten-year-old. I
leafed through them slowly, taking infinite pains
to try to penetrate some of their mysteries.
My reward came when I delightedly immersed
myself in the issues of the second magazine. They
were largely devoted to short stories written by
Arab authors or translated from various languages,
mainly European. But they also featured a won¬
derful serial unabridged (or what I thought at the
time to be unabridged) translations of the Iliad and
the Odyssey.
My family had moved to Damietta not long
before. I had spent my early childhood in a



Mahmoud

northern Egyptian village not far from the coast,
where the tang of the sea could already be smelled.
My father had been appointed headmaster of a
school there. We lived in one of the village's few
stone houses, whose first floor comprised two
apartments. A young couple lived across from
ours. The husband worked on a boat that plied
between several Mediterranean ports and regularly
dropped anchor in the waters of the Nile, on the
outskirts of the village. He was away for weeks at
a time, leaving his beautiful young bride all alone.
Since she had not yet had any children, she
could spend her days more or less as she pleased.
She would give my mother a hand, looking after
my sisters and especially, I think, myself. She
told me tales that I would later find in no book
and which held me spellbound for hours on end.
She opened up for me the secret doors of ever-
changing kingdoms, where even my unbridled
imagination was soon out of breath in its vain
attempts to keep up with her.
I remember that big room in her apartment one
evening when it was pouring with rain, as it some¬
times does in the Delta. She had lit a small heater
to ward off the chill that from time to time made
me shiver. I was sitting facing her, as close as I
could, riveted to that face whose beauty turned the
heads of all the men in the village. Her eyes seemed
lit from within, while her melodious voice carried
me beyond the seas, across deserts and valleys, in
search of faraway princesses, dashing princes and
wicked characters who unrelentingly tried to
come between them. The villains would be suc¬
cessful for a while but always failed in the end.
We were separated a short time later. My
father obtained his transfer to Damietta, and we
left the village forever. I was never to see my
beloved enchantress again.

### 93737: Why Ulysses?

Hussein
Sitting on the tile floor of my balcony, I would
sometimes feel the little shiver of that magical
evening run through me again. As I followed
Ulysses' wanderings, our neighbour's face would
appear to me sometimes in Penelope's enigmatic
smile, sometimes in Nausicaa's disquieting glance.
For a long while I missed the warm, soft closeness
of her body. Then, imperceptibly, she drifted out
of my life, to take her place among the princesses
of legend, standing behind her shutters, lost in one
of the countless palaces into which she had led me
and to which I no longer held the keys.
Homer introduced me to more complex,
more tormented heroes, whose paths criss¬
crossed before my eyes at a pace that now
depended only on how fast I could read. I had
sometimes lapped up dozens of pages before
nightfall, when my father's voice yanked me out
of my dream world to giye me some errand to do,
or my mother, worried about my eyesight, made
me come reluctantly ipiside.
I often got lost in the overpopulated plot of the
Trojan War, but found a few reliable bearings.
There were characters to whom 1 was clearly
drawn, others whom I definitely disliked. I
detested Helen, whose culpable frivolity was the
cause of the war, and I hated Menelaus even more
for taking her back after she had betrayed him so
many times. But above all, I was won over by
Ulysses.
Why Ulysses? Why not Achilles, for example?



The affinity I instantly felt for Ulysses left me
baffled. Nothing about him resembled the hero I
would have liked to be, or at least thought I would.
What perplexed me the most were his confused
feelings, his contradictory impulses, making him
so unlike the clean-cut heroes of my early child¬
hood. I was all the more perplexed to discover the
mysterious sway he held over me, the discon¬
certing ease with which I was drawn to his side.
Penelope on the other hand fitted easily into
my familiar world. She was the legitimate heir to
those exemplary queens whom I admired for
their tenacious fidelity and incredible resistance
to every temptation. Yet it was to her husband
that I was irresistibly drawn, that moody, wise,
insatiably curious adventurer who, not satisfied
with trying to find his way home, was eager on his
homeward journey to explore other possible
dawns, unknown feelings and new temptations,
temptations to which he sometimes succumbed.
Although his myth was far more familiar in
my environment than that of Ulysses, it was not
until several years later that I came across the
Arab hero Qaïs, who was "mad with love for
Laila". According to the legend, Indian in origin
as I later learned, the young man and his beloved
were brought up together in a nomadic tribe.
Qaïs, who was an outstandingly gifted poet, very
soon began singing of Laila's beauty and of the
love he felt and would always feel for her.
Naturally, as soon as he was old enough he asked
for her hand in marriage, but, contrary to all

expectations, Laila's father flatly turned him
down, on the grounds that the success of the
young man's poems had damaged his daughter's
reputation. Qaïs adamantly stood up for his love
and the father stubbornly continued turning him
down, finally going beyond the point of no return
by giving Laila to another.
Qaïs nearly went out of his mind. He left his
tribe and for many years wandered alone in the
desert, avoiding human contact, and with only
animals for company, until one day he came
across his tribe. He asked about Laila and found
out that she had indeed been given to another in
marriage. Seeking out her husband, he addressed
him sharply, prying into his relationship with
Laila. The husband's embarrassed answers only
made him more desperate. Finally he sought out
Laila herself, only to discover that the young
woman had not had much trouble coming to
terms with her fate. The only thing left for the
poet to do was fade out of sight from his kinsfolk,
once and for all.
I read and reread many versions of the legend,
in prose and in verse, with and without explana¬
tory notes. I never managed to feel sympathetic
towards the two protagonists. From the outset,
I thought Qaïs was too weak, too passive, and
Laila's character did not ring true. There was
nothing glorious about their story. They lacked
the courage to take their own lives, as Romeo and
Juliet would do a few centuries later, and Qaïs,
though betrayed, did not strangle his Desdemona.
Moreover, Laila's love seemed to me suspect
from the start. It was not as strong as that of
Qaïs; she did not deserve his love. Theirs was not
a shared feeling, but a one-sided passion that
became an embarrassment.
I could never fathom the attitude of Laila's
father. What had got into the man? Qaïs was a
kinsman, a natural match for his daughter. How
had Laila's honour been stained? Poetry was a
highly-valued means of expression in Arab tribes.
Some women even confided in poets in order to
achieve a respectable celebrity status through
them. A few of them regretted it when the poets
went too far and suggested a too intimate knowl¬
edge of their persons. But Qaïs was safe from such
criticism. His poetry spoke only of love, and his
love remained desperately chaste to the end.
The story left a bitter taste in my mouth, the
feeling of a waste whose senselessness irritated me
for a long time. At one point I tried dispelling this
unease by attempting to identify myself with the
heroes, trying to see them in a historical con¬
text, however approximate. I finally gave up,
resigned to living with my unease, content to
observe the unrivalled popularity Qaïs continued
to enjoy throughout the Arab world and to listen
for endlessly repeated echoes of his heart-rending
lament in all the Egyptian love songs. I could
understand neither how nor why an entire people
that so greatly admired the manly qualities of
courage, endurance and indifference to suffering
could have identified with a hero so lacking in
those qualities, and whose life was a tale of woe
from beginning to end.
I opted for Ulysses, dissociating myself from
the general opinion of my countrymen. Were
they not inexplicably repudiating themselves,
and some of their most loudly proclaimed values,
by applauding a hero like Qaïs? As a youth I
began taking note of these interlocking acts of
betrayal, all these rifts that little by little spawned
new loyalties. Part of me, however, would always
remain an orphan.
As far back as my eyes could see, I could no
longer discern my beloved enchantress, but I
would keep on scanning the horizon. Qß

Miss Savitri and her shadow
HAROUN, who is editor of a magazine in
Paris, wants me to write an article on
love in India. He phoned me from Paris
this morning with his proposal. The call arrived in
the office of the Chief Librarian, since I have no
direct line, and caused considerable consterna¬
tion. You can imagine that the Central Secretariat
Library, where I work, tucked away in a wing of
Shastri Bhavan, hedged in by all manner of
Government offices, a branch of the Central
Telephone Exchange, the Regional Passport
Office, and so on, is not accustomed to receiving
calls from Paris, capital of the fashionable world,
dream of callow youth and the heart's breath of
beautiful women. At least three colleagues rushed
in separately to inform me that Haroun from
Paris would call again. One remembered that I had
just come back from a course at the Institute of
Journalism in Paris. A librarian trying to shed
his skin, to emerge as a journalist poised at the edge
of a turning world. Waiting to jump on, with you
of course. Everything arrives and begins with
you. I would never have got to Paris if you hadn't
used your considerable influence.
"Haroun, how wonderful to hear from you! "
The line was as clear as if I was talking to him
from my little studio in the Rue du Bac, which I
gave up forever last month.
He wants me to write an article on love in
India for an issue of his magazine dedicated to
love. It was too expensive to argue that it was a

their legs wrapped around each other, curved

flesh and spirit mixing easily, so deliciously, in the
sixty-five love-postures of the Kama Sutra, as
they strain towards the highest pleasure of all, the
release of enlightenment, of Nirvana. That's what
each eye is fixed on, no matter that they had
worked their way through the anguish and
delirious delight of finely-differentiated love-
making.
"Or you know, Haroun, I could write about
Moghul paintings, Pahari miniatures, porno¬
graphic illustrations from the Kashmiri kings'
courts of three centuries ago. We have a highly
developed branch of love-painting, illustrating the
great Indian love stories, Sohni-Mahiwal, Laila-
Majnu, Heer-Ranjha. No?"
We're obsessed with love, anyhow, like every¬
body else. We think about it all the time, we
dream about it, like a tree waiting to fall.
I got the idea that he didn't want any of the
usual stuff. "Foreigners slip too easily into the
Kama Sutra and all that," he said. "Surely there's
something more recent." Just like a good editor,
laconic, looking at the floor or into the green
distance, smiling like an archangel when you
present something good. You're supposed to
understand the meaning sticking to both sides of
the word. Especially with an editor in Paris.
Everybody in the library believes that Paris is the
most beautiful city in the world. It is one month
since I returned, again into your arms my dear
where else? but Paris is still so much with me.
For example, when I go out with my sandwiches
at lunch-time, to the lawns beside Rajpath. You
know it well. One day you will ride in state up
this great central road of the city, slowly up the
low hill leading to Rashtrapati Bhavan, abode of
our President, with its grand cupola, and be
sworn in as Minister in this or that cabinet. Have
patience, you are still young, you have time.
Who knows this better than I, who sleep with you
at night from time to time, whenever you will
allow me?
Behind the splendid wings of the Presidential

residence are the Moghul Gardens, laid out in
straight lines, held in by rigid flower borders.
Until three years ago, before terrorist activity
overtook all our privileges, we ordinary mortals
could buy tickets and enter there when summer
flowers were at the peak of their bloom. It is
indeed a pity that you and I can never walk in gar¬
dens together. I like that very much. To pass
under fruit-laden trees with your beloved, to sit
with spreading green grass like velvet under your
bare feet, the smell of rich earth coming up from
burrowing fingers. Gardens are very much in
the tradition of love in our country. Perhaps even
the Moghul Gardens were conceived originally
for dalliance. Courtly love-scenes in our classics
were always set in gardens, with cheerful eyes
peeping from behind bushes at the entwined
lovers, and a small group of musicians playing
from a distant pagoda, open on all sides to the
winds, which carried the sweet sounds of flutes
and sitars through the caressing air.
IDEAS FOR A MAIDEN SPEECH
But the other beautiful gardens of Delhi are
public, open to anyone who can buy a ticket, a
small fraction of what it costs to see an Amitabh
movie. I understand perfectly, you cannot afford
to be seen walking with me in a public place. It is
exactly what the newspapermen are looking for.
A photograph on the first page of the Indian
Express, perhaps, captioned "Miss Savitri Behn
walking in Buddha Jayanti Park with 'a friend'."
They might even get a picture of me draped
around your beautiful body, gazing at you with
my usual adoration. Everybody knows that the
Buddha Jayanti Park is for lovers. Especially the
policemen. They leer through the bushes, waiting
for the right moment to jump out, fondle a breast
or two, extract some money, confused notes
changing hands in horrid shadows. Then they
drag off a deeply mortified, protesting couple,
their sweet kisses and touching all forgotten, a dis-

tant golden haze suddenly crumpled in the
clutches of the law, to the police station, to pay a
huge fine, or alternatively spend a night in prison
for indecent exposure, separately of course
whoever heard of housing men and women
together in jail?



This must not ever happen to Miss Savitri. It
would ruin her political career forever, destroy all
chances of eventually marrying a rich busi¬
nessman who would fund her campaigns in the
countryside. I would, my love, rather spend
thousands of lunch-times alone on the lawns
beside Rajpath, trailing between vendors of
banana chips and channa-bhatura, stalls of pens
and Rexine purses, or float off to watch street
plays on dowry-deaths and oppression of the
tribals, or attend a demonstration in the Boat
Club against the destruction of the environment,
or the dismissal of the BJP Government in
Himachal rather than allow the faintest whiff of
scandal to touch your career or your life. Not, of
course, that you would ever give me the chance
of compromising you. I am constantly admiring
your firm will, clear mind and determination.
They must stand you in good stead in the polit¬
ical milieu you have chosen.
We are not very busy in the library. There's no
money coming in this year for fresh purchases.
The country's economy is fragile, we are tight¬
ening our belts. You know of course the extent of
our foreign debt. Perhaps you should make your
maiden speech in Parliament on this point. They
will think you are intelligent. Devastating com¬
bination, an attractive, intelligent new woman
MP. Anyway, I have plenty of time. The library
is not highly frequented, though it is thrust in the
heart of official Delhi. By Pandit Nehru him¬
self. He planned for its easy access to babus and
clerks, petty functionaries located in crowded
offices on either side of Rajpath. They come into

Service Rules, published by Jain Book Agency.
There's a lot of time to think about this article.
Quite often since coming back I suffer from
claustrophobia, hemmed in by stacks of dusty
books. The usual question, like a snake, nudges
with its blunt head: where do I go from here? At
such points I retreat immediately with my lunch
packet to the Boat Club lawns and dream of you,
and how it will be when we meet. Though this
does not happen often, now. You pass a cool,
gentle hand through my hair and explain the
responsibilities of a new Member, though
Parliament hasn't opened yet. Why must I trail
after you, a slug with brown flesh, leaving a silver
trail in your grass?
PAYMENT IN ADVANCE
Today Haroun's call drew my attention to this
question of "Love in India". Why should it be dif¬
ferent from anywhere else? It is the same torture
and humiliation, I suppose. But hearing his voice
makes me think of my time in Paris. It was the
first time I had been away from you since we met
three years ago, and you captured my heart, drew
me into your net, swept up the bits and pieces of
me into a paper bag which you carry in your
hand like a magician's reticule. You jangle it in the
air if I make the smallest movement to stray. And
you take payment in advance. I paid heavily for
Paris. I was faithful to you all the time I was
there. Perhaps we are stupid about love, in India,
or incompetent. I never seem to reach the wide,
aching arch of equality, perfect, blissful, like in
Moghul architecture. You can see it in Humayun's

Tomb. With that arch, you can hold up a heavy

Once, shortly before I left Paris, I was waiting
for a train at the Saint Michel metro. I had just
seen Hiroshima mon amour in a small movie hall
at the corner of the Place Saint Michel. You
emerge and see in front of you the Seine, and
just beyond, the high flying buttresses of the
Cathedral of Notre Dame. It had been on the
insistence of Stella, Haroun's friend, a most beau¬
tiful and vivacious young lady, devoted to the
novelist Marguerite Duras. Read her books, she
has a wonderful style, read L'Amant. Stella gave
me a copy.
A SCENE IN THE METRO
There were not many people on the platform. A
man of indeterminate age with an untidy beard
and crumpled clothing sat slumped in a corner,
leaning against a high rubbish bin, looking at
nothing in particular, not even at an old bottle of
Evian, the small size, its label long since ripped
away, half-full of a colourless liquid which could
of course have been water. A long line of empty
red plastic chairs led away from him.
A large, broad man strolled slowly up and
down the platform. His exterior was smoothly
shaped by an expressionless face, shiny hair, and
hands in trouser pockets which opened the wings
of a prosperous overcoat to the wide stretch of a
green sweater. He stopped momentarily before
the seated figure, held out a crumpled note, then
continued his stroll at the same even pace. The
face of the drunk opened with surprise, delight.
I didn't even ask, the heavens opened and
dropped this gift. His hands shook slightly as
he opened out the note. A coupon cut from a
magazine. He looked towards his benefactor,
already steps away, shook his fist, mumbled
wretched, incoherent phrases. The other did not
stop, turn or change his pace. A woman in a red
leather coat, seeing everything, laughed shyly
with her companion and watched the "pursuit".
Because the drunk had launched himself from
' his seat, a pile of rags left behind still bore the
imprint of his frail shape. He proceeded jerkily,
still mumbling, at a quickening pace behind the
broad black back Why, why did he do this? I
didn't ask him for anything, how dare he while
a smooth stroll took the benefactor to the bottom
of the stairs and then, like a wave, swept him up
to the exit. He had not once looked back or
changed pace. We waited for the drunk to make
a last dash, launch himself in a dirty, weightless
ball into the middle ofthat solid back. His move¬
ment dissipated. He threw the worthless paper
violently on the rail tracks, where it floated
without effect, and spat a loud gargling stream of
phlegm. A few drops reached the distant suede
shoes of the curvaceous lady, who stamped her
feet angrily. 9ß

JEROME CHARYN
is an American writer. His
most recent published work is
The New Mystery (1 993).
THE United States of North America is
the first "modern" nation. It grew out
of a romantic ideal of liberty . . . along
very narrow lines. Those who rebelled against
the British crown in 1775 called themselves the
Sons of Liberty. They were farmers and lawyers
and rich grocers all of them owned property,
and all of them were white. But it didn't matter.
The idea of liberty began to spread. The farmers
and lawyers couldn't squirrel it away like some
unwanted shopping list. The nation had ter¬
rible conflicts and terrible wars over who could
have this-liberty and who couldn't.

## [Page 41](093750engo.pdf#page=41) 0

### 93746: Behind the silver screen

But the myth of liberty was much more
powerful than any narrow, self-defining law.
And with that myth came the notion of romantic
love. A free man in a free nation could also con¬
sider a new kind of love. If marriages had been
mostly arranged, and codified like any other
law, then that code would have to allow for a
little leeway. And it's no accident that a new
principality should spring up in a place called
California, in the first years of our century. That
principality is Hollywood, the land of love. It
could only have happened in the United States.
Other nations have had film capitals, devoted to
stars and fabricated cities, but those capitals
never had the same enchantment, the same aura
of royalty and romance.
And suppose Hollywood was a little foolish.
If it invented myths that were mostly fake, who
cared? It created a "college" of beautiful faces
that could cast beautiful shadows all around
the globe. It invented the movie goddess, who
lived only for romance. Rita Hayworth. Marilyn
Monroe. Rita married Orson Welles and Prince
Aly Khan, and Marilyn fell in love with Joe
DiMaggio, the crown prince of baseball. Both

goddesses' fairyland lives fell apart. Rita lost
her memory and all her mates. Marilyn killed
herself. But no other nation could have pro¬
duced such sad and powerful figures of love. Rita
and Marilyn had obscure, unromantic begin¬
nings no one is born a movie star, not even in



the United States. But they invented their screen
personalities out of America's own perverse
clay, which can be molded into anything at all.
Love and fame are America's real religion. Rita
and Marilyn sacrificed themselves for us so that
we could devour them, like the love cannibals
that we are.
Men and women worshipped Marilyn. And
while most of us lived out mundane lives as
fathers, mothers, daughters, sons, we dreamed
of that night-time religion, that world of
romance, which was much more devouring than
family business or blood.
Our psyches have always been split. We
came out of nothing. We invented ourselves.
We were new men and women in a New World.
We saved our pennies, we bartered, we built
little monuments, but that was never enough. We
needed someone like Marilyn to inhabit that
warm, wet, dark side of ourselves, the side that
said no to the American ideal of success.
Love is dangerous. Love is cruel. Its god¬
desses are crazy and fragile. But it's like a terrible
hunger we have our "fix", our food. I fell prey
to this food as much as anyone else. It didn't
matter where you lived. All ghettos and suburbs
were the same. America was homogeneous in
this regard. I fell in love at the movies. Where
else? The movie theatres bound all of us into one
enormous nation. I was born in 1937. By the end
of World War II I'd gone from romance to
romance, on the screen and off. I loved Elizabeth
Taylor and Gene Tierney and the wondrous
blond creatures in my second-grade class. I had

tummy aches. I sweated. I blinked. Like any
other cavalier, I was ready to die for love.
It's almost fifty years since I discovered my
first movie. Rita and Marilyn are gone. So has
Tierney. Liz Taylor seems to live at that suf¬
fering edge where love goddesses have to go. Of
course things are different now. The Aids epi¬
demic has turned the very idea of love into a
phantom self. Love is more than dangerous.
Love is death	
There's another phantom in our psyches.
Nam. The conflict in Viet Nam did more to
undermine the usual American myths than 200
years of American «orchistory. The land of the free
and the home of the brave was involved in a crazy
quicksand, a war that was as much hallucination
as anything else. The American GI, who'd become
a mythological figure, "Kilroy", the guy who
went anywhere, who helped liberate Europe,
who dispensed chocolate bars, who smiled
without malice, who had an innocent, sexual
charm, had suddenly become the murderer of
women and children in a land where nobody
really wanted him, fighting for some ideal that
made no sense. The GI was forever lost, and love
went out the window in the United States.
The whole country seemed to suffer a ner-
42
vous collapse. Sexuality meant guns and war¬
ships. Kilroy had travelled too far. he was now
an intruder, an unwelcome guest. And what
surfaced in the 1980s was an entire generation of
greed. Junk bonds. Buyouts on Wall Street. And
a new figure: the billionaire. He's young. He's
white. He buys art. He traffics in culture. He
isn't really mean. He romances money. That is
the love of his life.
A DARK KNIGHT IN SEARCH
OF HIS SOUL
The chief emblem of the 1980s wasn't E.T. or
Indiana Jones. It wasn't Ronald Reagan. It
wasn't Mickey Mouse. It was Batman. Created
in the 1930s, along with Dick Tracy, Mandrake
the Magician, the Phantom, and Smilin' Jack,
Batman was a reclusive millionaire . . . and a
modern masked knight. Bruce Wayne. He had
a boy assistant, Robin, and a Batmobile. His
nemesis was the clown prince of evil, called the
Joker. Batman was a 1 930s Robin Hood, with a
new Sherwood Forest: Gotham City, where
crime itself was a comic-book character, with its
own lively pull. Batman had a mechanical, wing¬
like cape and wondrous protruding ears.
But on the screen, in 1989, Batman was just
another billionaire. He looked like a bullethead,
an ice-blue phallus. At least his enemy, the Joker,
could laugh. Batman was a dark knight in search
of his psyche and his soul. He might have had a
girlfriend (Kim Basinger as photojournalist
Vicki Vale), but he was really loveless and alone,
like America itself.
Batman is white America: the world out¬
side his own particular castle is invisible to him.
He believes in some holy grail of the good, but
his mask is one more blinker. He sees nothing.
He feels nothing. He is nothing. The moguls of
Hollywood wouldn't even allow him to have his
boy assistant, fearing that Robin might conta¬
minate Batman, give him an ambiguous sexu¬
ality. But the moguls needn't have worried.
Batman has no sex other than his own bullet-
head.
And the crisis most of us have inherited
from Nam is an anaesthetized America in search
of itself and its sexuality. Marilyn remains our
one enduring goddess, both near to us and
remote. Will we be able to look into the void, see
the hollow core of our culture, its dance of
death, and redefine who the hell we are? Or
will we continue to be a nation of Bruce Waynes,
wearing some kind of loveless mask into eter¬
nity? I wonder. Pß

Letter to a lovelorn girl
I am writing this, my sweet, to help you get
over this latest heart-break of yours. Each
time you had one before, you told me it
was the worst and would be the last. Now you're
suffering again and once more, of course, you
wish you were dead. You won't believe me if I
gently repeat that the pain doesn't last, but
remember what you said when I spoke to you
about the way people feci when their heart is
broken for the first time: there won't be another
time, you snapped back, because I shall never
fall in love again as if that were possible, as if
love were not the only cure for love. . . .
Every time you fall in love the same thing
happens, but what you haven't yet understood
is that "everlasting" love doesn't last long, for the
simple reason that we are always changing. Today
we are not quite the same person we were 43

yesterday, and except in the case of friendship,
which endures without vows or promises, it
would be too much to expect to go on loving the
same person in the same old way through so
many changes from day to day. We would per¬
haps do better to follow the example set by
someone more realistic about his fellow-crea¬
tures and about the instability of feelings, the
man who promised his bride-to-be to love her "as
eternally as possible".
People often fail to understand, or else they
forget, that love means a constant longing for
the physical presence of the loved one, and that
once he or she is present the longing, like a slight
pain, disappears something that often happens
in marriage. The unacknowledged reason why we
* experienced that element of pain was that we
were afraid someone else would deprive us of the
loved one's presence.
I know, or at least I suppose, that women
love in a different way, more tenaciously, more
obsessively, as if dedicated to one single task and
no other. I knew a girl your age whose dream was
to get to know Paris but who, on her very first
visit, gave up wandering the streets, sitting out¬
side cafés, watching the Seine go by or visiting
museums, just to sit at home by the telephone "in
case he rings". Something you men are incapable
of, she used to say.
We are incapable of a lot of other things too
not that we don't feel love, or feel it less strongly.
Incapable, for instance, of giving ourselves up, in
an almost mystical way, to such a full-time fixa¬
tion, to that fruitless turning over and over in the
mind of a single problem, that overpowering
obsession, incapable of dropping everything else,
to the point, sometimes, of forgetting our other
activities or even our duties. Love is one of the
mainstays of our lives but perhaps rightly or
wrongly not the only one for us.
I also believe that no-one, man or woman, in
the world is worth such suffering, such agony,
such a crushing blow to what had only the day
before been a normal, healthy human being.
Sometimes it takes no more than a letter, a phone
call or a cancelled date.
It may be just a word left unspoken or a word
that, although wrapped up in a roundabout
phrase, nevertheless means goodbye, since there
is always a leave-taking involved when one person
leaves another for someone else which is most
painful of all or for another country, which is
like taking a new lover, or it may simply be that
the affair has bogged down in boredom.
Nicolas Bouvier* speaks of the gratitude he
owes to every woman who has left him. Each
made way for another, and he draws this simple
conclusion from a certain number of failed love
affairs: for every separation there is a specific
cause have you looked for the reason in your
own case, so as to benefit from it?
Ifwe accustomed ourselves to the idea that the
other person could die tomorrow learning to
cope with loss in advance, which is, I believe,
enriching and salutary in any relationship we
would immediately feel more respect for one
another, we would refrain from saying things
that cannot be taken back. Isn't it incredible that
love should rest upon mere words, which can
just as easily break and destroy it?
I know for sure that the reason why you are
suffering now just as much as you suffered before
is that the one you love is not with you, but I also
know that absence can smooth over difficulties,
can even make those obstacles that appear when
you are together vanish into thin air. Absence is
a sleight of hand, a conjuring trick that, if it goes
on long enough, can even turn your invincible
love, which now seems stronger than yourself,
into "just one of those things", a minor incident
that is already past and almost done with. So
much so that when two parted lovers meet
again as in the tangos of Gardel they wonder
how they could have been so carried away and
feel ashamed of having been so blind. Growing
older a day at a time prevents us from seeing the
changes taking place in ourselves, but sooner or
later blind Cupid opens his eyes and learns to see.
Everyone is receptive to love poems and love
songs, a world of inexhaustible riches but at the
same time monotonous. However profound their
imagery and whatever their verbal felicities, they
are all alike, in the same way that love stories, in
spite of their differences, are all alike, but they
seldom sing of requited, lasting love. Not because,
as Aragon says, there is no happy love. It must
exist somewhere, but it seems unable to survive
the passage of time. Most of these songs and
poems prefer to dwell upon, and bemoan, for-

gotten, star-crossed loves, love destroyed by
over-indulgence or lack of money, fleeting or
unattainable love. You won't believe me, but I
have even known girls who found something
beautiful about "love-sickness" and who went in
for those passionate epistolary affairs that are so
good for Post Office business.
I am not saying this to console you: I really
believe we have not yet learned how to love.
When people talk about dislike, hatred, anger,
resentment or revenge, we know exactly where
we are, but that enormous word "love" rings
hollow. We cram into the empty space all sorts of
feelings and intentions that have nothing to do
with it or even contradict it: the desire for pro¬
tection or togetherness; the will to dominate (the
demands made on women by living together
often end up type-casting them in the role of
mother-cum-sccretary, if not of housemaid too);
a distorted sense of ownership, equating women
with beasts of burden; the pleasure of playing to
an audience; a taste for ostentation or for keeping
up appearances; a longing for company when
you have only the cat to talk to in the middle of
the night; or else the need for someone to share
our troubles with and to hold out a helping hand
when we stumble.
What I mean is that we are still living in the
past, in a bygone time when women were god¬
desses or priestesses, slaves or prostitutes, idolized
or despised, whereas true love is a relationship
between equals. If we make an effort like when
we were in school and needed good marks at the
end of the year to go up into the next class
and if we try, simply and unassumingly, to build
the framework of married life in long, slow stages,
as carefully as if we were building a house of
cards, then perhaps we shall, in a few thousand
years' time, learn to love without introducing
qualifications, or at least without leaving scars,
without causing pain, without denying one's
»
own or another person's right to live his or her
own life, without heaping reproaches on each
other, without inflicting so many sacrifices, sup¬
posedly freely accepted, on one another.
Stricken with this love-sickness that you think
is incurable when in fact it just comes and goes
rapidly like a fever you are perhaps unaware,
my little girl, that we all suffer from it, that none
of us can get over it and we don't want to. It's like
when the sea catches you unawares, choking
you, stinging your eyes and bruising you
inwardly. Or if you prefer it's like when you
breast the waves, striking out into them in spite
of the warning they have just given you, swim¬
ming further and further out until one wave
stronger than the rest swamps you and hurts
you. That's the way it will be as long as the sea is
the sea.
Each time you will emerge enriched by the
experience. From each of these men, and from
yourself too, you will draw some lesson that will
help you cope better with your next love which
will, you'll see, again be the "only" one and "for
ever", like the one before. Alas, I shan't be there
for you to tell the story to, for you to cry on an
old man's shoulder, for me to try to console you
by stroking your hair or hopefully to cheer you
up by talking nonsense.
So all I can do now is to plant a kiss on your
little wounded heart; for it is your heart, your
pride, that is wounded, not your soul.

the project's local expenses. The
donation will be released after the

THE HISTORY OF CENTRAL ASIA
Unesco has just published the first
volume of its long-awaited 6-volume
History of the Civilizations of Central
Asia. This vast region, an extraordinary
melting-pot of civilizations, today
embraces northern India, northeastern
Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, western
China, Mongolia and the five new Central
Asian republics: Turkmenistan,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and
Uzbekistan. The first volume, which has
been written by noted scholars most of
whom are from the region, deals with the
Palaeolithic and Neolithic cultures and
with the Bronze and Iron Ages, ending
with the pastoral and nomadic tribes at
the beginning of the last millennium of
the pre-Christian era. The second,
scheduled for publication later this year,
will deal with the development of
sedentary and nomadic civilizations up to
the third century B.C.
Volume I (535 pages, price 200
French Francs) is available from the
Unesco Bookstore, 7, Place de Fontenoy,
75352 Paris 07, France.
GARDENERS OF THE EARTH
Jardiniers de la Terre (Gardeners of the
Earth) was the title of an international
film festival held at Unesco headquarters
on 26 and 27 January 1993 in
connection with the Organization's "Man
and the Biosphere" programme. Some
thirty films were shown and fourteen
countries took part. The two top Unesco
prizes went to Bruno Sorrentino (United
Kingdom) for his documentary Rivers of
Sand and to Bernard Blllois (France) for
his film Sauver la petite Bäise.
PLACES OF HONOUR
IN THE WORLD HERITAGE
Twenty new sites were added to Unesco's
World Heritage List in January 1993: the
town of Butrinti (Albania); the mines of
Rammelsberg and the historic town of
Goslar (Germany); Fraser Island
(Australia); the Belovezhskaya Pushcha
National Park (Belarus/Poland); Angkor
(Cambodia); the regions of Wulingyuan
and Huanglong and the valley of
Jiuzhalgou (China); the pueblo of Taos, in
New Mexico (United States); the historic
monuments of Novgorod and its environs
and those of Vladimir and Suzdal, and
the Solovets Islands (Russian
Federation); the cathedral of Bourges
(France); the ancient town of
Pythagoreion and the temple of Heraion
in Samos (Greece); the pre-Hlspanic
town of El Tajin (Mexico); the old town of
Zamosc (Poland); the historic centres of
Prague, Cesky Krumlov and Tele (Czech
and Slovak Republic); and the
archaeological site of Ban Chiang
(Thailand).
A photograph of Angkor is reproduced
with those of twelve other World Heritage
sites on a high-quality 1993 calendar
produced by the German stationery firm
Zanders and Unesco (not for sale).
SOUL-BIRDS
An exhibition of abstract paintings and
hundreds of drawings of birds by Sri
Chlnmoy, a poet, painter and musician
who hails from Bengal, was held at
Unesco from 9 to 13 November 1992.
For this visionary artist birds symbolize
the soul. A roving ambassador of peace
whose works have been shown all over
the world, he composed this New Year
peace message for 1993:
God is dreaming,
Newness singing,
Oneness blossoming,
Fullness dancing.
Hope no more gropes
Life without slopes.
Splendid depths and heights
Transform bondage-nights.

TRADITIONAL MUSIC
The Unesco Collection of
Traditional Music is one of the
outstanding achievements of
Unesco's programme to preserve
and revitalize the non-material
cultural heritage, which, because
it is transmitted orally or by
gesture, is in even greater danger
of being lost to posterity than
endangered monuments.
The collection consists of
three series, "Music and
musicians of the world",
"Anthology of traditional musics",
and "TraditionaFmusic of today",
and comprises both new
recordings and re-issues on CD
and cassette from Unesco's earlier
collections, started in 1961. The
collection already includes fifty-
five titles. The recordings are on
sale at the Unesco bookshop, 7,
Place de Fontenoy, 75007 Paris,
France, tel. (Paris) 45.68.22.22,
and in many record shops.
INDONESIA. Musk from West Java.
Anthology of Traditional Musics
Unesco CDD 8041
These recordings, made in
1970 and illustrating the Javanese
influence on the culture of the
Sunda region, are among the
finest examples of gamelan
music. This fascinating
Indonesian musical tradition has
inspired various Western
composers and jazzmen;
Wesleyan University (United
States), for instance, has a
complete gamelan orchestra.
Sundanese music includes
popular forms such as the kacapi
suling, an instrumental ensemble
consisting of flute and zithers, the
music of the former royal courts,
ofwhich the track "Gonjang -
Sapuratina" is an example, or
scenes from the Ramayana
("Walang Golek", played here by
one of the old gamelan degung
ensembles; this type of music
dates back to the Hindu period of
Sunda's history, before the
conversion of Java to Islam, and is
specific to this part of the island).
The melodies, tuned to various
modes, including the salendro,
are delightfully developed with a
profusion of different timbres and
rhythms.
POPULAR MUSIC
ELTON JOHN.The One
CD Rocket 512 360-2
On this album cover
concept by Gianni Versace with a
portrait of the artist by fashion
photographer Patrick
DemarchelierElton John offers
the listener several intricate,
poetic texts, rich in metaphor and
allegory. Most of the songs are
orchestrated with synthesizers
producing dense layers of sound.
They range from hard rock
("Sweat it out") to gospel ("When
a woman doesn't want you", with
piano accompaniment) and from
disco ("Understanding women")
to country. Elton John fans will be
delighted to find him sharing the
track "Runaway train" with the
legendary guitarist, and
occasional singer, Eric Clapton.
JAZZ
ROY HARGROVE. The Vibe
Hargrove (trumpet), Antonio Maurice
Hart (alto sax), Marc Anthony Cary
(piano), Rodney Thomas Whitaker
(bass), Gregory Hutchinson (drums)
With Wynton Marsalis and
Wallace Roney, Roy Hargrove is
certainly the best young
trumpeter around today, and
Antonio Maurice Hart is hot on
the trail of Branford Marsalis (who
incidentally features on the tracks
"Pinocchio" and "Runnin out of
time"). Hargrove and Hart dazzle
audiences with their insatiable
appetite for playing (during their
European tour last summer they
had two hours' sleep a night on
average, jamming in the street, in
clubs or in their hotel rooms after
concerts). Their sound is solid
and happy, rooted in what is
sometimes called the "neo¬
classical" jazz of the 1950s and
1960s. This album includes
Hargrove's previous successes
"The vibe" and "Caryisms", Wayne
Shorter's "Pinocchio" and Miles
Davis' "Milestones". Trombonist
Frank Lacy is heard on three
tracks, David "Fathead" Newman
on "Alter ego" and Jack McDuff on
"Blues for Booty Green's". The
rhythm section is excellent too,
and more is sure to be heard of
Marc Anthony Cary.
Ella Fitzgerald sings the George and Ira
Gershwin songbook
Double CD album, Verve 825 024-2
When Ella met impresario
Norman Granz in the 1950s, her
career was in the doldrums and
she was recording lack-lustre
material. It was thanks to his idea
of cutting the "songbooks" of the
composers of the great American
musicals that Ella achieved world¬
wide fame. The "Gershwin
Songbook" is probably the best in
the series. With marvellous
backing from the Nelson Riddle
Orchestra Riddle spent a whole
year writing the arrangements-
Ella's voice, at the top of its form,
glides effortlessly through the
songs with stupendous clarity of
diction, feeling for the words and
warm vibrato. The witty ditties,
"Beginner's luck", "'S wonderful"
or "I've got a crush on you", are
gems of their kind. This is a disc
for your desert island.
STANLEY TURRENTINE. Ie/;7 go
Turrentine (tenor sax), Shirley Scott
(Hammond organ), Ron Carter or Bob
Cranshaw (bass), Mack Simpkins or
Otis Candy Finch (drums)
CD Impulse GRP 11042
"Let it go", a re-issue of a
pleasant, unassuming recording
made in 1966, features the
organist Shirley Scott, often heard
in Paris where she settled a few
years later, and Stanley
Turrentine, before his more
commercial "fusion" phase. Like
Nathan Davis, another tenor sax
player from Pittsburgh,
Turrentine has an extremely clear
articulation and a keen feeling for
the beat, and, again like Davis,
knows how to give each note a
different colour. Scott has a
flowing touch and her Hammond
organ swings in the style of Jimmy
Smith. This is a CD to savour at
home in the still of the night.
CLASSICAL MUSIC
BERLIOZ. Béatrice et Benedict
Orchestra and chorus of the Lyons
Opera, conducted by John Nelson.
Double CD album, Erato 2292-45773-2
Berlioz' last work, Béatrice et
Benedict, a two-act comic opera
based on Shakespeare's comedy
Much ado about nothing, is
seldom performed. As Berlioz
himself observed, the score is a
difficult one, the male roles in
particular, though he thought it
one of the liveliest and most
original he had written. The story
takes place in Sicily. Beatrice,
niece of the governor Leonato,
and Benedict, an officer of Don
Pedro's conquering army, neither
of them inclined towards
matrimony, finally succumb, after
various twists of the plot, to love.
The music is light and vivacious,
the orchestra is conducted with
sensitivity and precision, and the
singing is agreeable in timbre.

begins to emerge. Democratic states should
aim to provide social benefits, but should
such benefits really be considered as rights?
If the answer is "yes", then we have a situa¬
tion in which the state will tend to absorb civil
society in order to respond to all its socio¬
economic needs. This is a very dangerous
process. That is why, in the post-war debates
at the United Nations about the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, the question of
formal rights versus social rights was central
to a highly political confrontation between the
United States and Europe on the one hand and
the Soviet Union on the other.
What was at stake was not just a specific
political choice but an ideological choice. Do
we want to live in a liberal society that, while
it responds to demands for social justice,
does not treat them as rights, or do we make
social justice a fully-fledged right and give the
state the job of implementing it? If we do, it
means giving the state powers that become
exorbitant in every respect. In the former
Soviet Union, negligence at work could be
considered an anti-revolutionary act and lead
to years of internment. That is the perverse
logic of social rights.
There have ofcourse been attempts topro¬
duce a synthesis.
I think the republican idea has played a
very important role in trying to reconcile
these two types of rights by means of uni¬
versal suffrage. If, as happened during the
Third Republic in France, you establish uni¬
versal suffrage and encourage people to par¬
ticipate in political decisions, then you are
heading for the conciliatory logic of the wel¬
fare state. The framework of the liberal state,
strictly speaking, still exists, but the citizens
by voting call on this liberal state to pay
increased attention to social justice and to
intervene more actively in civil society. This
represents a big change. Here it is the citizens
who are telling the state what they want.
Roughly speaking, this is what has happened
in Western social democracies. We have never
moved away from a liberal political regime,
and yet there is continual state intervention to
promote social justice. Providing that the
right balance is struck between civil liberties
and intervention by the authorities, the wel¬
fare state seems to me unbeatable as a demo¬
cratic model.
Surely you 're not suggesting that it 's some
sort of magic wand! This is a particularly
important issue if you look at things from
the standpoint of the emerging democracies
of the South. They have other balances to
think about, such as those between the rights
ofthe individualand the expression ofcertain
collective values, between national decision¬
making authorities and the world market.
We could indeed look further into the three
tiers of democracy and the possible links
between them. The first tier is that of suf¬
frage, which may be direct or indirect, uni¬
versal or based on a property qualification; the
second is that of national representation
members of parliament, senators, Lords or
whatever; thirdly there is the tier responsible
for overseeing the rule of law constitutional
, courts and so on. Strange though it may seem,
no one has thought about improving these
three tiers, or even changing them completely.
Why have they stayed the same for centuries?
Europe, as well as the countries of the South,
should think about certain improvements in
their functioning and in the links between
them. If nothing is done, political institutions
and civil society will grow further and further
apart, with increasingly serious consequences.
The construction of a European system
has increased the risk of a major political crisis
that can only play into the hands of dema¬
gogues and nationalists, who will claim that .
they are closer to the people and their preoc¬
cupations than traditional politicians are. There
is a tendency for the various levels of democ¬
ratic representation to become increasingly
remote from individual citizens, whereas
democracy cannot exist unless citizens can
find their way around the political institu¬
tions. For a multitude of reasons, the citizens
of the various European countries have diffi¬
culty in finding their way around the European
institutions. Nobody in Italy or France or
Germany knows what the Council of Europe
or the European Parliament really is.
One ofthe strongpoints ofdemocracies has
been to stimulate sometimes radical criti¬
cism from within. How do you explain the
fact that they have become lethargic and
accepted this increasing remoteness without
reacting?
Unlike totalitarian states or traditional
societies, democracies are places where indi¬
viduals have the right to criticize the law and
the political establishment. But between the
wars, and especially after the Second World
War, European intellectuals and artists the
potential democrats, so to speak turned to
communism. There were historical reasons
for this. The struggle against Nazism, then
against colonialism, led intellectuals of the
Left to criticize fundamental Western values,
including formal democracy, which they
treated simply as an outgrowth of capitalism.
Much of this criticism of formal democracy
in the last seventy years was unfortunately

cast in the mould of communist, leftist,
Maoist or Trotskyist ideology, the main result
being to obscure the real questions instead of
bringing them into the open and helping to
find fresh solutions.
Even reformism was carried along by this
current and became trapped in communist
patterns of thought. In France, for example,
Léon Blum made a famous speech to the
Socialist Party Congress at Tours in 1920 in
which he declared that he was opposed to the
Bolsheviks as regards the means used to
achieve the dictatorship of the proletariat, but
not as regards the end itself. Caught up in the
communist eschatology, the reformist plat¬
form seemed no more than a diluted, flabby,
insipid and deodorized version of commu¬
nism. Things have changed in the last 'few
years, but there's a lot of catching-up to do.
In your view, what are the first questions
that reformism should address after over¬
coming this handicap f
It must take a fresh look at the three critiques
of democracy. Two of these come from out¬
side the Marxist view, which criticizes
democracy in the name of the radiant future,
and the generally speaking Romantic, fascist
view, based on the idea of the lost past. The
third critique comes from within the democ¬
racies themselves. It is based on their own
principles and their own promises,' and points
out the gap between those principles and the
reality.
Why does reformism seem so uninspiring
these days? I've given a lot of thought to the
question of reformulating reformism, anJT
have come to realize two things. One is that
the strength of leftist or communist Utopian
ideologies was due to the fact that they bor¬
rowed from religion not the politico-theo¬
logical elements Marxism rejected, not the
superstitious aspect of religion, but its claim to
possess the answer to the meaning of life.
Marxism claimed to express values-that tran¬
scended the life of any person living in the
here-and-now. What was splendid in the
Marxist utopiaor perhaps- one should say
utopias, in the plural was that one was
working for something higher than one's own
life, that the lives of individuals and the fate of
humanity as a whole touched at some point.
Unless there is a "here below" and a
"beyond", life has no meaning. If we do not
accept the existence of this dichotomy, we
can only ask elementary questions about the
meaning of life. If our acts only have meaning
in the context of some specific project, the
question of the meaning of this meaning can
never arise. The meaning of existence has to
transcend the partial, mundane meanings we
give to our daily lives. Marxism gave an
answer to this fundamental question, but
now it's lost. That's the first point. Reformism
must rediscover something of the same kind.
Paradoxically, though, it must also step
outside that framework and free itself from the
straitjacket of secularized religion. That's the
second point. To do so, it must set itself a so to
speak unending task, not the achievement of
an ultimate purpose like that of the Bolsheviks,
but a purpose that is always moving forward
and is never fully achieved, a purpose in line
with an approach-that has at last been secu¬
larized. We must find a new purpose in life, but
a secular purpose. In every field science,
education, culture, politics it is the rein¬
statement of the idea of progress within the
perspective of an endless task, the pursuit of
perfectibility and freedom, that can give án
ultimate meaning to all that we do.
When you come down to it, the biggest
paradox ofall is that theology, whether reli¬
gious or Marxist, should have an end.
Theology sees history in terms of the end of
history, just as a believer holds that after
death comes an end, admission into Paradise.
That's right. For Marxism, the coming of
communism is the end of history, whereas in
the secular perspective I am suggesting, it is the
idea of the endless nature of the task ahead that
gives meaning to existence. Once we know
that the task is endless, we also know for sure
that our present efforts are not vain. Continual
self-improvement is important because it never
goes to waste. To think of perfectibility as the
pathway to culture and culture as an ongoing
process of liberation, as an ongoing expansion
of human experience perhaps this is where
the essential meanings come together in a sec¬
ular universe.
