### 102875: Interview with Hervé Bazin

Hervé Bazin
7 write to warn. 5
The French writer Hervé Bazin, who
died in February at the age of 84, made
his reputation with the virulent
attacks on the institutions of family
and motherhood contained in his
autobiographical novel Vipère au
poing (1948; Viper in the Fist, 1951).
His later novels on social themes and
psychological conflict won him a wide
popular readership and a number of
literary prizes in France and elsewhere.
Among his best-known novels are Chi
j'ose aimer (1956; À Tribe of Women),
Madame Ex (1975; "Madame X") and,
most recently, Le neuvième jour (1994;
"The 9th Day"). Hervé Bazin gave this
interview to the UNESCO Courier
shortly before his death.
Let's talk about your latest book, Le
neuvième jour. . .
Hervé Bazin: God created the world in
six days. On the seventh he rested. On
the eighth he expelled Adam and Eve
from the earthly paradise. We are now
living on the ninth day. We have entered
the ninth era, the time when faustian
man takes the place of the Creator.
Human intelligence gives us access to var¬
ious highly sophisticated forms of cre¬
ation, which also have a strong potential
for destruction. Humanity has the choice
between happiness, which will never be
absolute, and universal suicide.
You write to warn, to keep the
public on its toes	
H.B.: My long experience in journalism
has taught me a utilitarian approach to
writing, an approach I would describe as
committed and designed for direct com¬
munication. I have always been driven by
the problems facing contemporary
society. At the present time it is impor¬
tant to set them down in books because,
given the speed of modern communica¬
tion, there is a constant turnover of news;
however important events are, new ones
happen and push the earlier ones into
limbo. People need permanent landmarks
to help them put things in perspective,
touchstones to help them distinguish
between real threats and those that are
simply passing fads.
Nuclear power is dangerous, for
instance, and we shall have to live with
it until the end of time I mean that we
must make sure the bomb is never used
but I don't think it is a major peril
because it is closely monitored and small
states are not in a position to manufac¬
ture atomic bombs. Biology is dangerous,
however, because it is accessible to any
lab assistant who can tinker with viruses.
In Le neuvième /our you give
fictional treatment to a scientific fact.
H.B.: The subject I deal with in Le neu¬
vièmejour had been in my mind for a long
time. The novel is more effective than the
essay in bringing to a wide public a uni¬
verse which is , alas , very real and not at all
science fiction. In my novel I imagine a
strain of influenza, a "superflu" far worse
than the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 on
which known vaccines have no effect. To
prevent a catastrophe, an all-purpose pre¬
ventive vaccine has to be found very
quickly. The main character, Monsieur
Alleaume, discovers that it is possible to
make such a vaccine. But of course that
isn't the end of the story. A researcher may
be motivated by a desire to benefit
humanity, but we also have to reckon with
competition between firms in the health
business which to quote from my novel
"would be very unhappy if they were
beaten to the post and had to abandon
their sacred profits to rival companies".
And so my novel is a warning. Be careful!
Man has taken the place of God . He is fre e
to destroy himself and the earth with him,
because he has equipped himself with the
resources to change and invent all kinds of
Biology will only continue to be beneficial if it is closely
monitored, like nuclear power.

things. We don't know the precise origin of
Aids, for example, but researchers know
how to create the virus in vitro.
What forms can the 'biological
peril' take?
H.B.: Today other methods of racial selec¬
tion exist than those designed by Hitler.
There may be some Fausts among the
researchers who are working away in the
shadows. The viruses they discover may
become a form of currency, instruments
of pressure and oppression, diabolical
weapons. But the propagation of a virus
can be deliberate or accidental. In 1978
in Birmingham, a researcher named Henry
Bedson was working on the monkey
smallpox virus, which was suspected of
being transmissible to people. The virus
infiltrated from the laboratory through an
air duct with a defective filter to the next
storey of the building, which was inhab¬
ited, and caused the death of two people.
In despair, Bedson committed suicide.
But people like to keep quiet about this
kind of incident.
... Examples of man playing
around with nature?
H.B.: Biologists know that nature uses the
same chemical language for all living crea¬
tures whose genes are interchangeable.
In other words, researchers can cross bar¬
riers. I picked out some funny but
authentic examples from the animal, veg¬
etable and human worlds. Biologists
working on sap have done some astonishing
tilings. There's no need to dye cotton jeans
any more, for example. All you have to do
is splice a gene from a blue flower into
the cotton plant. One third of the vegeta¬
bles and cereals grown today are trans¬
genic they have received additional
genetic material to endow them with new
characteristics. Scientists are licking their
lips over all these possibilities.
One of my friends, a plant research
specialist, is trying to make luminous
tobacco using genes from glow-worms.
What on earth is the use of tobacco that is
luminous at night? None at all, you might
say. Well, think again. It proves the unity
of life: animal and vegetable get on well
together. By replacing one gene with
another, you can make anything you like.
Here's another amazing, crazy and dia¬
bolical example. There is an extremely
useful medicine based on lactoferrin, a
substance produced in very small quanti¬
ties by women who breast-feed their chil¬
dren. The lactoferrin gene has been taken
from a human being and transmitted to a
bull that later inseminated fifty-odd cows
that now produce masses of the stuff.
There are plenty of examples of this
kind ofthing. California is a big producer
of strawberries. Unfortunately, strawber¬
ries are sensitive to frost. A late frost can
ruin the whole crop. But now it's possible
to prevent strawberries from freezing by
introducing into them a gene from plaice,
a fish that is resistant to cold. It's soon
done! Just imagine! The Americans, whose
regulations arc extremely strict, rejected
the idea out of hand. So the growers and
researchers turned to countries where
there is a more relaxed approach.
How does public opinion react?
And the scientists, who have access to
confidential reports? Do they veto this
kind of thing?
H.B.: In Japan, public opinion is imposing

warn...
a slowdown on this sort of way-out
research. The same thing is happening in
the United States. But the downside can
lead to beneficial discoveries. How won¬
derful it would be if we could discover
genes to combat cystic fibrosis! Biology
will only continue to be beneficial if it is
closely monitored, like nuclear power. The
trouble is that it costs a fortune to make an
atomic bomb, whereas it costs much less to
start a laboratory. Mad scientists do exist.
Firmini was a wise man. He discovered the
disintegration of the atom and took his
secret with him whereas Einstein made it
known to the world. Myxomatosis is a
classic example of this kind of thing. A
researcher who lost his temper when his
vegetable garden was destroyed by rab¬
bits, and infected them with the disease,
which he had discovered in his laboratory.
Unfortunately, there was a hole in his
garden fence and the two rabbits escaped
and propagated the virus.
Many people associate you with a
chaotic rather than a peaceful world,
an impression strengthened by your
rebellious subjects and writings.
H.B.: Rebellion is not totally negative. I
had my say against the family in 1948 in
my novel Vipère au poing, the story of my
battle-axe of a mother. That book brought
me success but it also scandalized many
people. It was in a way my psychoanalyst's
couch and also an act of revenge. With a
start in life like mine, biting comes easy.
Actually, it's quite healthy, and you start
biting into other subjects. Later I became
more self-detached. A story is a story,
there's no need to go on and on. You
change, you live your life, you have new
experiences. And so I left hatred of the
family behind me. I became a novelist
instead of a memoir-writer. Characters
were born in me.
After writing about the cruelty of
family life, I turned to its joys in La mort du
petit cheval (1950; "The Death of a Small
Horse"). I have always been attracted by
the world of outsiders, in this case the men¬
tally ill, especially after the French news¬
paper France-Soir commissioned me to
find out what was happening in the world of
French psychiatry. This helped me to write
about the psychology of the mentally ill
in La tête contre les murs (1949; Head
Against the Wall, 1952) and the psychology
of a pyromaniac in L'huile sur lefeu (1954).
It is widely known that the pyromaniac is
someone who wants to be a great purifier.
The book is based on the true story of a
fireman who started fires so that he could
put them out. With this novel I really
moved away from autobiogaphy. In the
sequestered world of madness I also dis¬
covered an administrative system that was
adept at closing files when families wanted
it to and was not above drugging patients to
destroy the minimal mental faculties they
had left. The mentally ill don't do anything
to help to keep society's wheels turning
and so they must be eliminated.
Eventually, however, I found peace
thanks to the country life I wrote about in
Qui j'ose aimer (1956) and Chapeau bas
(1963). After three marriages, with chil¬
dren and grandchildren, I discovered
loving fatherhood (A u nom dufils, 1961;
Le matrimoine, 1967), in contrast to the
delinquent motherhood I had described
in my first novel. I also wrote about people
who have to fight against the death of
the body, and the mental repercussions of
this , in novels such as Lève-toi et marche
(1952; Constance, 1955), not forgetting
the time, described in Le démon de
minuit (1988), when in the evening of his
days a man sees his approaching death
almost like a spectator.
You are particularly fond of one of
your novels, Les bienheureux de la
désolation (1970), which symbolizes
the break between the peaceful world
of the past and the modern,
destructive world.
H.B.: It's my greatest social novel. It is
based on something that actually hap¬
pened and that intrigued sociologists.
About 250 people lived on the desolate
island of Tristan da Cunha, in the south
Atlantic. A volcanic eruption forced them
to leave and take refuge in England, where
they discovered the joys and sorrows of
civilization. It made me think of the
Indians and Eskimos and other indige¬
nous peoples killed by so-called civiliza¬
tion. In the end, the islanders returned to
their devastated island and recreated it,
using technology to tame hostile nature,
not harming it but not letting it get the
better of them either. This is a lesson from
the awkward squad, whose members range
from the youthful rebels of May 1968 to
eighty-year-old ecologists. These are the
people who link the old world and the new.
This is an example of a civilization
that refused to give up being itself, that
preferred the quest for itself to wan¬
dering and exile. The people of Tristan da
Cunha belong to a community that finds
adventure on its own doorstep, and enjoys
freedom, equality, solidarity and mutual
help without competition or domination.
A community where need keeps out
luxury. There now! I almost feel that I'm
making a politician's speech on the eve
of an election! But we have to admit that
those islanders actually did what we
waste our time talking and writing about
without making any contribution to
human progress, since politicians look no
further than their own navels, and our
civilized and industrialized societies now
have poverty knocking at their door.
How do you write your books?
H.B.: On an old typewriter, an ancient,
Writing is a social art.

noisy Underwood that requires fingers of
steel. I just can't bring myself to use a
word processor. I need the physical effort
ofwriting. Ink gives shape to the informal,
to mental processes. I can sit at my Under¬
wood from seven in the morning until two
o' clock the following morning with only
short breaks for meals. Fictional char¬
acters are very possessive. Some of them
are elusive and try to run off the page,
while others are too demanding. When
you write like that it's like boxing and
sculpture. When all's said and done,
writing is a very physical activity.
It's true that you don't give your
readers a very easy time. You shake
them up, you hector them, you never
let them relax. Bazin is often
synonymous with hardness and
cruelty. Your pen is a scalpel.
H.B.: As I told you, I like good clean bites.
Our age is built on pretence. Everyone
wears masks. Mine is described by some¬
thing Sartre once said. "One writes to
warn". Writers are angry witnesses. They
are watchdogs who bite. But that doesn't
stop me from being a member of several
organizations that work to promote peace
and save the planet. But writing isn't a
gratuitous act. The French writer
Georges Bernanos said, "God didn't put
a pen in my hands for me to have fun".
The aesthetics of writing and research
for its own sake are not my thing. Writing
is a social art. It is socially useful and
looks at subjects via a witness called a
character, who has to tell things in a lively,
effective way. Writing is not a game; it is
engraved in the memory. The world's best¬
sellers are the Bible and the Qur'an.
The poet Rainer Maria Rilke, a man
of great sensibility, said that writing is
like 'rutting'.
H.B.: Yes. It's also a way of breathing and
to a certain degree, a drug. It's impos¬
sible to do without it. "It's divine", we
say pretentiously. And in front of the
blank page, we always feel stage-fright,
panic. You say to yourself, "Is it going to
come? Will the magic happen again?"
Writing is always unpredictable. Like a
page of life you live each day; you have a
vague idea of what is going to follow on
from yesterday's chapter, and then, sud¬
denly, something turns up. And off you go!
Our age is built on pretence. Everyone wears masks.
Mine is described by something Sartre once said:
'One writes to warn.'
When that happens you write for hours
because you have to maintain contact:
there's a prompter somewhere in the
wings. We are not entirely responsible for
what is happening. If, for example, at
the start of a novel you describe one of
your characters in a certain way, you don't
change it later on. You can't do it. Ratio¬
nality has nothing to do with it. It's more
like metaphysics or even spiritualism.
You are president of the Goncourt
Academy, which awards a prestigious
French literary prize every autumn.
How does the selection process work?
H.B.: Edmond Goncourt, who outlived
his brother, welcomed innovative writers
to his literary salon in his so-called Gre¬
nier, two rooms in his house at Auteuil. To
perpetuate this practice he left his for¬
tune to endow a literary academy the
Goncourt Academy. Awarding an annual
prize is quite a job. I have to read about
150 books no manuscripts. This means
that my brain has to be an empty shell
so as to be receptive to every sentence.
When you've read fifty pages, you can
already feel whether a writer has talent or
is a mediocrity. So many people want to
write! It's like a marathon: a thousand
start, only fifty reach the finishing-line.
And you can sense the writers with only
one book in them and those who will cover
several generations; the ones who will be
a nine-days wonder and the ones who even¬
tually will be read in schools; the ones
with stamina and the ones with asthma.
One talks about authors in the same
way as one talks about fine wines. I must
confess that for some years there have
been no fine vintages, no great years. The
Goncourt Prize is not the national lot¬
tery. There is no favouritism, no vote cast
for one of my publishers. But in order to
stay impartial and neutral you really do
need to be deaf and blind to pressure
from the media. To return to the wine
metaphor, it sometimes happens that we
lose our nose for quality. The classic
example of that was when Gallimard
rejected the manuscript of Marcel
Proust's novel! Talent is the most impor¬
tant thing the Goncourt jury is looking
for a traditional quality that needs to be
brought back in many fields. Another
important thing is a kind of spontaneity,
so that the reader sees the pageant of
events just as if he or she were looking at
it out of the window.
What does Hervé Bazin do when he
isn't writing novels?
H.B.: I love astronomy, and so does my
eleven-year-old son Nicolas, my seventh
reincarnation. He stargazes and plays the
violin. Will he become a writer? Looking at
the stars always makes me think of the
creation of the world, and the planets
make me dream about the time of chaos,
when the inchoate universe was still
nothing but a primeval soup of fire, gas
and molten dust, with the inklings of the
soul that would lodge in our cells. And I
like to stay in contact with people and
nature. To stop myself becoming a dry
stick, I draw plans for my house, I potter
about, I cut wood, I do masonry. Physical
effort gives a writer balance. I garden, and
in summer, with my wife, Odile, I tutor
my son. Now that I've rediscovered my
provincial roots in Angers, I cut down my
trips to Paris; I take the train there and
back the same day. I feel the Paris social
and literary worlds are very artificial.
I'm over eighty, but as far as age goes
I decided to stop my clock at forty. Forty
is a nice compromise, a good point from
which to look backwards and forwards.
My mind and body are as alert as those of
a forty-year-old. I must confess that for
me nothingness doesn't exist. My recipe
for living can be summed up in one word.
It is absolute and it goes a long way: "Be!"

On page 41 of your October 1995 issue
("The United NationsWhy it matters")
you show a green area created by the
Food and Agriculture Organization of
the United Nations (FAO) in Keita (Niger)
as part of a development project. I know
of others in the area, especially in the
Tahua distict.
This is a good opportunity to pay
tribute to the FAO and all the other spe¬
cialized UN agencies that are engaged
in development projects. More work of
this kind should be done to bring back a
green environment to countries hit by
desertification.

RIGHTS AND DUTIES
Your November 1995 issue ("Peace, a
new beginning") contained the text of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights
proclaimed in 1948 by the United
Nations.
Could we ask the UN to add to the
title of this document the word "duties",
since duties are described in it. As the
19th-century French theologian Lamen¬
nais once wrote, "Rights and duty are
like palm trees, which bear no fruit if
they do not grow near each other".

THE NOTION OF 'RACE'
Your March 1996 issue ("The roots of
racism") insists that human "races" do
not exist and that humanity cannot be
classified in such terms.
I was all the more surprised, there¬
fore, to see that the notion of race
appears in your back cover subscription
advertisement: "3. [The Courier] asso¬
ciates its readers with UNESCO's mission of
furthering 'universal respect for justice,
for the rule of law and for human rights
and fundamental freedoms . . . without
distinction of race (my italics), sex, lan¬
guage or religion. . . .'"
Vincent Nicolas
Conflans-Sainte-Honorine
(France)
This quotation containing the word
"race" is taken from the first article of
UNESCO's Constitution, which was
adopted in London in 1945. The term
less criticized then than now empha¬
sized the universal desire for world
peace extending to all human groups.
Since then, use of the word "race", as
you correctly point out, has become more
debatable. Editor
TOO CLEVER BY HALF?
Congratulations on the articles by Fed¬
erico Mayor and Edgar Morin in your
November 1995 issue ("Peace, a new
beginning").
Edgar Morin writes that the planet is
in trouble. It might be useful to
remember what the great Taoist philoso¬
pher, Chuang-tzu, said on this topic three
hundred years before the Christian era:
"Excessive intelligence creates disorder in
the radiance of the moon and the sun,
breaks up mountains, dries up rivers and
upsets the seasons. These evils even go
so far as to disturb the fearful worms and
the tiny insects in their habits. What dis¬
order does not the love of ingenuity bring
to the universe?"

### EDITORIAL

onth by month
In July 1967, the Unesco Courier published an issue entitled "Noise pollution". The contributors
to it reported on what was then being done to halt the invasion of noise in the modern world and
to mitigate its harmful effects on the human body and on society at large.
In that issue of the Courier, silence was perceived negatively, as the absence of noise.
But there is more to be said about silence than that. Rather than an absence, it can be a
presencein the self, in the world, in the sacred. It is closely associated with religious expe¬
rience is often achieved through silenceand with artthe poet's words speak
out across silence, which is at the heart of painting and the fount of all music.
Contributors to the present issue bear witness, each in their own way, to the power of
silence when it is the culmination of an inner journey or a bond with others.
Historian Christophe Wondji describes the importance of the spoken word of the traditional
African chief, whom silence surrounds like a sacred halo, and ethnologist Myriam Smadja
describes the secret harmony that a ritual of silent mourning creates between the living and
the dead of West Africa's Tammariba people. Psychiatrist Miguel Benasayag, author of a
first-hand account of torture in the gaols of the Argentine dictatorship, and film-maker Hervé
Nisic, who has made a silent documentary about Sarajevo abandoned to martyrdom by a
cynical world, suggest that there are some situations to which silence is the only dignified
response.
Other contributors describe the role of silence in mystical rapture (flautist and musicologist
Kudsi Erguner), in musical performance (concert pianist Elizabeth Sombart), in poetry
(Claude Louis-Combet) and in painting (Kumi Sugai). Silence is felt with particular intensity when
there is harmony between body and mind. For physiotherapist Jacques Castermane those
who achieve this silence have learned a lesson in the art of living and the practice of peace.

### 102876: Men of few words: interview with Christophe Wondji

Men of few words
interview with Christophe Wondji
The word of an African chief is the sacred fruit of a
long and silent apprenticeship
A village chief
in Botswana.
Africa attaches great importance to oral
tradition. Is there such a thing as an 'African
silence'?
Christophe Wondji: There are several kinds of
silence. The silence of the night and the silence of
the forest contrast, for example, with the sound of
tom-toms during festivities and merrymaking, and
with the eloquence of the griots musicians and
folk-historians. There are also the profound silences
that punctuate the utterances of wise men, such as
those of Ogotommel, the old Dogon sage ques¬
tioned by the French ethnologist Marcel Griaule.
Speech is an act. It comes from the depths of
one's being. It is a form of commitment. That is
why the head of a family or a village speaks only
at the appropriate time and place. Words spoken by
a chief can be divisive. They can wound and even
kill. A chief is therefore very careful about deciding
when he should speak. There is an Akan proverb
which says that the spoken word is worth its
weight in gold. In other words, it is comparable to
11 \\\y
the signs engraved on the little bronze statuettes
that were once used in parts of West Africa as
weights for weighing gold dust. The only way of
access to this word is by going through successive
stages of silence, which "weigh down the tongue".
Who can receive the words of an elder?
C. W.: A father chooses the quietest of his sons,
the one least prone to lose his temper, the one
said to be "like a grave", in that he takes in words
but does not utter any. His attitude shows he is
keen to learn: he remains in the company of
"elders", but keeps silent in their presence, thus
showing that he knows his place.
One day the father takes the son he has chosen
to one side and says to him: "My son, I want to
give you some fragments of the Great Word the
word that concerns the origins of our family. You
shall reveal nothing, I am sure: your belly is deep."
A person whose belly is not deep who
immediately repeats what he has been told is
left out, because "everything comes out of him
easily". If he is incapable of keeping his mouth
shut when he is young, how will he be able to
keep an important secret later on in life? It's easy
to spot a man "with a light mouth". Just tell him
something of no importance and make him swear
to keep it to himself. If he boasts about it to the
first person he meets and during the heat of the
day gossip circulates fast beneath the straw
roofs the blabbermouth is disgraced forever.
How is the word passed on?
C. W.: By keeping one's mouth shut and one's
ears open. The young man lets the elder speak.
The master expresses himself slowly, in a rather
low voice. His speech is punctuated by long
silences, so that his words can penetrate the
younger man and become part of him.

The griot (village musician
and historian) of a Guiñean
village with his grandson.
Does the disciple make any comment while
he is receiving his instruction?
C. W.: He never interrupts the elder with untimely
remarks. For many a long year he simply listens.
And as a result of his patient listening, his spirit is
elevated and gradually approaches the truth
embodied by the master.
It is only when he feels he has understood a
little that he starts asking questions, but he is in
no hurry to do so. Until he has made the elder's
words his own, he will be unable to use his knowl¬
edge properly. That moment will not come until
he in turn is in charge of a family, a group of
hunters or a whole village.
For some time now, educators have been
striving to introduce new methods of "expression
and communication" in Ivory Coast schools
following a Western fashion. The emphasis is on
dialogue. "Put your point of view across," very
young pupils are told. "Formulate your doubts
11

### 102876: Men of few words: interview with Christophe Wondji

and your criticisms." It is easy to see why the pupils
fi nd it hard to adjust to a practice so totally alien to
their tradition of respecting a master and a corpus
of knowledge.
Can the silent listening of a disciple be
compared to that of a hunter lying in wait?
C. W.: In a sense, yes. In Akan, silence is defined
by the following expression: "Nothing can be
heard from the deep forest." The young hunter
holds his breath and remains motionless as he
learns how to recognize animals by certain sounds
they make the growl of the leopard, its muffl e d
tread, the flapping of an elephant's ears, the rustle
of grass under an antelope's hooves. There is an
attitude that corresponds to each animal, but also
an appropriate way of shooting it. When faced
with a leopard, a solitary and combative animal
that is quick to scent danger, the hunter has to
adopt a completely different strategy from the
one he will use with an antelope, which is timid
and guileless. The arrow has to hit the leopard
first time, in the head or the heart, otherwise it is



bound to get you.
In the same way, the head of a family or a vil¬
lage, or indeed an Ashanti king, has to resolve
conflicts with a good deal of tact, and without
being unfair to either party. Like the hunter lying
in wait, he seems to be keeping out of it. His "cane
carrier"1 conducts the debate in his place. The
chief's words concern each person and are

Park (Botswana).
i
addressed to all. They therefore need to be
selected, or "sifted", by the cane carrier. They
are full of unspoken thoughts, which are
extremely important, and which the elders know
how to decipher.
The chief, then, listens patiently without inter¬
fering. Used as he is to staying in the background,
in an attitude of attentive observation, he has learnt
how to fathom the human soul. He can see
through masks and contradictions. When he
intervenes it is to bring matters to a close using
only a few words. He is expected to take the right
decision courageously. He, too, has to "aim accu¬
rately", in other words recognize the trouble¬
maker but not exclude him: "He who is wrong
must not sleep outside."
You're talking about words spoken in
public. What about those spoken in private?

Fulani leaders returning from
a ceremony (Nigeria).
CHRISTOPHE WONDJI

Regional Histories section of
Unesco's Division of International
Cultural Co-operation. His
published works include La côte

("The West African Coast from
Senegal to Côte d'Ivoire:
Geography, Societies, History,
1500-1800", Paris, 1985).
C. W.: A chief does not speak to all and sundry, at
any time or in any place, except via his cane car¬
rier. If a "well-intentioned" person comes to see
him and makes indiscreet remarks about one of
his collaborators, he will simply say "I heard, thank
you", turn away and refuse to receive the person
again. How can someone who divulges a secret
be trusted? What's more, the informer surely casts
doubt, by his very act, on the chief's discrimination.
It is as if he were saying to him: "You don't know
how to choose your associates." The chief knows
full well that a slanderous remark actually seeks to
destabilize his power.
The chief's authority resides above all in his
ability to keep calm and control himself, a faculty
which he has developed since his youth, and
which enables him to maintain a certain distance
from himself and curb his temper.
One day, the inhabitants of a Bété village who
felt they had been aggressed by the chief's men
came to insult them. When the chief appeared,
they redoubled their insults, because the chief
embodies the whole village. The chief first listened
to their vociferations without uttering a word, then
decreed: "You are within your rights" and invited
the malcontents to join him over a jug of bangui
(palm wine). They all fell into an awkward silence,
then ended up admitting: "We went too far."
The chief is responsible for war and for peace.
He has to find words that soothe, not words that
incite, for when he dies he will have to leave his
children a vigorous, united and prosperous society.
And for that he will have to answer to his ancestors.

Silence fills the Atakora valley on the
nights when the Tammariba1 celebrate a
tibenti, a mourning ritual practised by the
elders of the clan. All the elders come and sit in
front of the dead man's takienta his house, a
small earth-built fortress with windowless walls
flanked by two towers topped by granary-
lofts with pointed roofs, out in the middle of
the fields. In the moonlight the takienta, whose
name means "that which guards" (the living),
shows its real face the gigantic face of the dead
person, and through it, the face of the ancestor
who founded it.
It is the dry season. Blowing off the desert, the
harmattan brings clouds that blot out the stars.
The clan members are motionless and silent,
seeming to melt into their surroundings. Their
ears are filled with the sound of the wind. "When
an elder passes on, a violent wind gets up."
Why this long silence? "It is through silence
that the living communicate with the dead.

Silence is the true word." In observing this
silence, the clan makes contact not only with
the breath of the recently deceased but with the
b reath of all the ancestors of his line, which goes
back to Dinabaa, a mythical place from which
came the first Tammariba and the first men.
The breath of the ancestors
When the moon rises, the breath of the dead
elders leaves the tombs in the cemetery and
makes for the houses, where each one of them
has an altar. The silence of the clan calls to them
and invites them to join the living. They too will
take up position in front of the house and pre¬
pare to guide the recently dead clan member
down the road to "the place where one goes".
But if "the night is on the side of the dead, as
the day is on the side of the living", it also
belongs to the real masters of the place, i.e.
"those underground", who come in the guise
of the wind. By day, these underground spirits
are curled up in the roots of trees, in the depths
of springs and under rocks. They coil up in the
folds of the "Earth's thick skin", which is like
the inside of the skin of the immense female
python who is the mother of the Tammariba or
"Kneaders of wet earth". The name the Tam¬
mariba give themselves thus refers both to
their own origins and to that of their takienta,
which they have shaped with the flesh of Earth
irrigated by waters from underground.

From earliest childhood, the Tammariba
know that at nightfall they must lower their
voices and lighten their step. In the evening
the underground spirits, in the form of white
mares, take possession of their territory trees,
rocks and the "beloved" marshlands. They
hate the noise made by humans: the loudness
of their voices, the stamping of their feet, the
pounding of pestles and the smith's hammer.
But they put up with this as long as they are
forgotten at night, when the world returns to its
primal state, "still beautiful, filled with silence",
when all that can be be heard is the wind
sweeping over the surface of the earth.
By keeping silent, the members of the clan

sharpen their hearing to a pitch comparable to
that of the underground spirits and the dead.
"Isn't hearing the last sense remaining in the
grave?"
An inaudible call
At the moment when the "dogs themselves
stop barking", a call seems to ring out. A man
who has climbed unobtrusively onto the bal¬
cony has uttered the name of the deceased,
the secret name of the master of the takienta,
the name it was forbidden to call him in his life¬
time. The call has not been addressed sky¬
wards, but simply murmured through a hole
linking the upper part of the house with the
lower floor. It was "whispered in a breath", or
"muttered inaudibly in the throat".
But the silence has dug such a space in each
of them a space as broad as the surrounding
plain that the controlled voice of the Caller
has sounded with the force of a horn.
"At the sound of his name, the dead man's
soul has jumped!" Drums and flutes begin to
play. The breath, separated from the shadow, is
now ready to live again in a child. The power of
this call to the dead to bring forth a new life
*ir*»f '
only exists because of the silence from which it
draws support a silence as vast as the night,
swollen by the breath of the living massed
before the takienta.
Among the Tammariba, silence is the
pedestal on which the clan's solidarity is based.
For each generation, this tibenti or collective
listening before a house in mourning weaves
unbreakable bonds between the members of
the clan. The Tammariba avoid using "the lan¬
guage of daytime, which is kept for arguing
and joking," to name that which is greater than
they are the mystery of death. That which,
from death, again becomes life. Rather than
betray, deform or make a mockery of this mys¬
tery, the Tammariba prefer to keep silent about
it, knowing that "others, like themselves, have
felt the same".
The Tammariba might echo Ludwig
Wittgenstein's phrase: "Whereof one cannot
speak, thereof one must be silent".
1. The Tammariba (singular Tammari) are hunters,
herdsmen and farmers who live in the Atakora
mountains and valley on each side of the frontier
between Benin and Togo. They number around 100,000
and in Togo are more commonly known as Temberma
and in Benin as Somba. A typical fortress-like

Is an Argentine psychiatrist who
has published a number of
essays, including Penser la
liberté: Le hasard et la décision
("Thinking about Freedom: Chance
and Decision", 1994). He has also
written about his Incarceration
and torture in Argentinian jails In a
book, A pesar de todo ("In Spite of
Everything", 1982).
I There are some things I cannot talk
I about; they are too painful for me and
even remembering them overwhelms me. But
at the same time they are like a scream that is
locked in my throat and wants to come out;
by staying pent up inside me it wounds me
even more. Perhaps I shall be able to talk about
these things, in one way or another.
To talk under torture is "to collaborate with
the enemy". But how can you not talk, when
they put you through the mill?
The footsteps come closer, ever closer.
They touch me on the shoulder and whisper in
my ear: "Let's go!" They help me to get up.
Hell	 I take off all my clothes. They stretch
me out on a metal bedstead covered with a thin
foam mattress, fasten an electric wire to my
toes, another around my penis, another around
my fingers. At this moment, the torturers
seem big and you end up by thinking that they
know everything, that it is impossible to trick
them.
You let it happen, what does it matter now
whether torture, rape or killing is allowed or
not? The time for words is over. There's no
point in saying, "It's scandalous". It's not a
scandal. It's something that exists. It's happening.
What it means to be silent
under torture
I catch myself thinking that it would be
better if they were to kill me. Now I couldn't
care less when one of them pretends to exe¬
cute me. Why go on suffering?
This is the moment they are waiting for.
But it is a moment that belongs to the victim. It
is the victim who holds the key to the situa¬
tion and decides whether to talk or not to talk.
Why not talk?
Under torture, the idea of death seems to me
the most natural thing in the world. I have lost
the tragic sense that normally accompanies
death. The moment arrives when they come to
to kill us and when they find us prepared.
We can die under torture, without talking,
to cover up for our comrades and brothers
and also our political work which will survive
us, but all that has nothing to do with heroism.
We die because we have reached the point
where death has ceased to matter.
We refuse to talk, because that is the only
way of saving something of ourselves. Those
who believe in heroic speeches are wrong
with the best will in the world. It's something
much smaller, more mundane, more confused,
more human and ultimately more beautiful

. . . Behind the window, near the inter¬
phone, he was looking at his woman friend. It
was visiting day at the prison. She recognized
him. Deep in his eyes she again saw light,
strength and love. Pedro had survived. He had
not talked under torture; he could talk to her.
The point of no return
There is a time when a man can decide to be
reduced to nothingness. He cracks up under
torture. "I've had enough. I'll say and do all
you want!" The point of no return is reached.
El Negro betrayed his own wife. He was
crazy about her. Brought face to face with her
in the torture chamber, he repeated his accu¬
sations against her. He wanted the torture to
stop.
A man "who has talked" feels crushed,
incredulous, a stranger to himself. Demolished.
How and why should he go on living? He is no
longer a man who could say to his wife: "I love
you." To love someone you have to be
someone yourself. By betraying others, he has
betrayed himself. In his own eyes he has ceased
to exist. By saving his life he has lost everything.
18
Roberto Juarroz (1925-1995), Argentine poet
I remember El Negro as a shadow haunting
the corridors of Resistencia prison. Trembling,
bowed head. ... A piece of flotsam. When he
spoke he merely groaned. We tried to give him
a little human warmth: he was not there, he
was at grips with unbearable anguish. We all
shared the chill that gripped El Negro.

### 102889: The Height of silence

Faces of Sarajevo.
Stills from Hervé Nisic's
fl Im The Height of Silence
(1995).



The Height
of Silence
interview with Hervé Nisic
The Height of Silence, a
documentary filmed by Hervé
Nisic in the beleaguered city
of Sarajevo in 1995, consists
entirely of 'silent interviews'
in which men, women and
children gaze at the camera.
Here, Canadian journalist
Hadani Ditmars asks Nisic
about the meaning of silence
in his film.
What role does silence play in your film?
Hervé Nisic: It is the whole essence of it. When I
first went to Sarajevo during the war, I was struck
by the fact that people were fed up with trying
to explain to foreigners what was really happening
there, the stories that were not told by the mass
media. They also seemed to be fed up with
listening to people promising help and then not
following through.
Sarajevo had become a kind of no-man's-land
of broken promises and inaction. Its people had
reached a point where words were useless and
meaningless, and were being used as a kind of
phony communication, a point where it was
better not to say anything. There was a feeling
that "Everybody knows that the situation is bad,
everybody's tried everything, let's just shut up
aboutit."
Even if they thought that you might be honest
and really wanted to help them, there was still a
feeling of why bother? nothing will change. There
will still be bloodshed and massacres no matter
what we do. Things had reached that point in
Sarajevo.
There was a feeling that I was just visiting people
in a kind of prison, that I could go back home but
that they had to stay there. As the "visitor" I could
go away, but they had to stay there, under siege.

### 102889: The Height of silence

Somehow, silence felt like the only possible
basis for real communication with the people of
Sarajevo. But it was also a kind of test. I often felt
that the people were asking me, with their eyes,
"Are you really able to stand the way that I look at
you? If you can do that, then perhaps I might talk
to you afterwards."
All communication was through the eyes.
So is silence a sign of despair or a sign of
defiance in your film?
H.N.: Silence is very ambiguous, and this is why I
chose to use it as a means of communication in
my film. I don't think there is a word in any lan¬
guage that can describe the situation in Bosnia.
Silence is the only way of transmitting its com¬
plexity and the people's feelings. There is an
immense dignity in the people of Sarajevo. You
can see it. I am sure that anyone who looks at the
images in my film will see how dignified those
people are. Everything is contained in those
images. Words don't add anything. You can't
make any further comment on such images. Even
as I'm talking now, what can I add ? If you've seen
those images, then you understand. There is no
need for words.
Does silence play a role in Bosnian
tradition?
H.N.: Silence has always been part of the way that
you're welcomed. It's based on respect. When
you go into a café, for example, if people have any
interest in you, they will stare at you and stop
talking. It can last for quite a while.
But this film is not about the Bosnians. It's a
film about the relationship we Westerners have
with Bosnia. It's a film that implicates the viewer.
The silence of the Bosnians responds to the
silence of the West in the face of the tragedy. It's a
direct reaction to the impotence of the West, to its
apparent inability to act, to its "false presence",
and its official line which is: "We are here, but
we won't intervene, because we don't want to
provoke things."
This official attitude carries in itself its own
condemnation, and there is no better condem¬
nation than silence. The Bosnian people don't
want to be angry with us, with the West, with our
governments. They want to keep their silence. I
suppose that this silence is also a way for the
Bosnians to say "We despise you." But at the same
time the way that they look at us is full of hope.
They are saying with their silence, "Look, here
we are, we're human beings just like you, see
what we are."
20
So in a way, your film bears witness to the
real situation in Bosnia.
H.N.: Yes. The silence in my film was a way of
bearing witness, but also of crying, of shouting, in
a way that is so dignified that it denies any
response or counter-attack. If someone shouts
at you, it's easy just to shout back at them. If
someone shouts at you silently, what can you do?
Is silence, then, a kind of protection for the
people in your film?
H.N.: Yes. It's a kind of protection, but it's also a
way of trying to make the other person think or
reflect. It is as if the Bosnians were saying, "If I
remain silent when I'm a victim, what do you

## [Page 21](102874engo.pdf#page=21) 0

### 102889: The Height of silence

think of that?" The other person is forced into a
position of re flection. It is also a way of provoking
another level of understanding in the viewer. This
became clear when I was making the film. I
described my project to every person that I
filmed. I told each one, "I want you to look at the
camera as if you were looking at the people who
were beyond the limits of Sarajevo on the other
side of the siege." The gaze of the Sarajevans was
intended as a gaze that would pierce through the
camera, through me who was filming, through
the viewers on the other side through time and
space.
Is it more difficult to twist silences than
words?
H.N.: We all know that, if you consider the amount
of information that goes from one person to
another, perhaps something like 10 per cent goes
through actual words. Perhaps another 20 per
cent goes through the way we express our¬
selves through tone of voice, and so on. And
the rest, that is to say most of the information,
comes from the whole body. When we see or
make films, we tend to think that dialogue says
it all. It's not true. Dialogue says only 1 0 or 20 per
cent of it. The rest is presence. The film under¬
lines the power of non-verbal communication.
But didn't people talk to you, in between
your silent "interviews"?
H.N.: Oh yes, sometimes it took me three or four
hours just to get the right three-minute take.
Sometimes, it took us that long just to get used to
each other. The only rule was that there was only
one shot, one frame, one take. So I had to wait for
the right moment, when everybody had agreed on
when and how we would do the take, when
everybody felt comfortable. There is no artificial
light in the film. Everything was filmed in a very
natural way, to show the people as they are.
In your shots of the landscape of Sarajevo,
there is a sense that the ruined buildings and
the barren fields are also keeping silent, as
witnesses to a tragedy.
H.N.: What I would say is that this kind of silence
is really a basis for dialogue. I hope that my film
will make people talk.
What effect did it have on you to film the
Sarajevan "gaze"?
H.N.: It would have killed me if it were a weapon.
I was hurt by those glances. But I was happy that
they projected such strength. Usually the
Bosnians are shown as victims in the media. And
the more you see people as victims, the more
you accept that they are treated as victims.
I was offered the opportunity to film people
who had been wounded in the war, but I refused.



I wanted to show the Bosnians as beautiful, strong
people, not as victims or complainers. I didn't
want to be a voyeur, either. By giving them the
opportunity to be silent in front of the camera, I
was giving them a chance to show their dignity
and humanity. Using silence was the strongest
way to do this. A film about silence became the
only real means of communication.

### 102890: A Mystic journey

The Sufi musician draws
his notes from a well of silence
Silence is the spring from which the Sufi
musician draws his music. In that he is
akin to the earth in labour. The musician does
not know what will emerge, or when, but he
cannot let the moment go by; he must be there
when the seed sprouts.
Likewise, no one can know in advance what
will come from the seed buried within them.
Only the sound of the ney a reed flute can
reveal the face of this other person who is one's
real self. The sound of the ney re-opens in us a
wound from a past time when wc were totally
at one with plants, stones, water and stars. The
memory of this union vanishes at our birth.
But when, in silence, we hear the first notes of
the ney, memories rise up in us, and we
remember this lost homeland.
"We have all heard this music in Paradise,"
wrote the thirteenth-century mystic poet Jalâl
ad-Dîn ar-Rûmî. "Although the water and clay
of our bodies have cast doubt over us, some¬
thing of this music drifts back into our
memory."
According to Islamic tradition, the ney has
this power to command memory because "the
reed quill was the first thing created by God".
Like humankind, the ney was cut from its
roots, the reed-bed by the pond's edge. "Ever
since then," complains the ney in Rûmî's
words, "my dirge makes men and women
lament. I call to a heart torn by separation to
show it the pain of desire."
The ney is thus man's double. Both have
wounds on their chests and are enwrapped in
bonds. Both are empty and desiccated because
the earth no longer nourishes them. Each is
voiceless without the other. The reed flute is
made to sing; it only comes to life at the musi¬
cian's lips. Hearing its notes, the musician
glimpses the inaudible vibration of the celestial
vault and remembers the time when he was
wedded to its movements. The time when,
unveiled, he contemplated the shining face of
God. "Wc are the flute," sings Rûmî. "Our
music comes from Thee."
The sama is the spiritual concert where the
ney is accompanied by the daf (a frame-

mounted drum), the tanbur (a long-necked
lute), the kanun (zither), the ud (short lute) and
the kemence (violin). It takes place in the
evening in a tekke (a large room in half-light).
The musicians, who are gathered on one side
and surrounded by an audience on carpets and
couches, only begin to play after several hours
have elapsed, when a long silence has settled in.

Listening
Sama means "listening". During the sama the
musicians play compositions from one of the
modes (maqam) in the repertoire or impro¬
vise on this mode. Some maqam belong to a
tradition that may go back to the fourteenth
century. They vary little in their form and are
well known to the audience. But they are never
played or listened to twice in the same way.

Persian proverb
A flute player
in a Turkish village.
During a sama, the listeners are invited to
embark on a journey of the soul. The route is
spiral-shaped, and each stage of it is marked by
a silence, as if wishing to test the solidity of the
foothold reached before continuing the ascent.
The musician, said Rûmî, provides the foot¬
prints. The ney player indicates a direction and
creates a favourable environment for the
journey. A specific atmosphere goes with each
musical mode.
No one at the beginning of a sama can guess
how the journey will end. Perhaps in a joyful
meeting with the Beloved? Perhaps it will not
be long, or the traveller will have to turn back.
. . . Everything depends on the hal (state of
mind) of the audience and the musician. But
the two are so intertwined that it is impossible
to know which influences which.
The word hal does not denote a vague
feeling caused by a vagrant mood but the
degree of elevation which a person with a
"pure heart" achieves at the end of a period of
inner asceticism. If he aspires to the divine, he
must control his instincts without repressing
them. The horseman who listens to his mount
rather than guiding it has little chance of going
far. In the same way, we must silence our inner
sounds our carnal passions and concen¬
trate our listening powers so that they become
sharper and more watchful, sensitive to the
slightest change of tone.
Sometimes the silence of the audience may
be so complete that it feeds the silence from
which the ney player draws the force and soft¬
ness of his notes. At these moments the mir¬
acle of breathing becomes palpable for
everyone, musician and listener alike. Inhaling
and exhaling seem virtually automatic. In an
almost unreal silence, the sound of the ney is a
reminder that an instant of life is won with each
breath. The musician's ear is schooled in the
harmony of the celestial vault. By filling the
reed's tube, his breath prolongs the contin¬
uous rhythm of the universe. He becomes the
echo of its unending movement.

Music,
time, eternity
by Elizabeth Sombart
I I am eleven years old. I am about to walk
I on stage for my first concert. All is
silence here in the wings, far from the hubbub
in the hall as the audience arrives. I am over¬
come by a fear that I've never felt before. I
walk on stage accompanied by the sound of
my footsteps and those of the audience. Sud¬
denly deep within me I feel I must return to
the long silence offstage before I play my first
note. How extraordinary that I need all these
people in front of me to feel the absolute neces¬
sity for silence that is required before music
can be played.

### 102892: Music, time, eternity

The truth dawns on me that noise is some¬
thing that we merely hear. To experience
music, we must listen to it, and to be able to
listen, there must be an inner silence. Without
this silence, there is no music. I must imme¬
diately forget the concert hall, the audience,
the noise, the doors that open and close in the
muffled velvet atmosphere. ... I must hear
only my own silence, the silence that lives deep
in my heart. Breathe deeply. Breathing must
make my fingers move. "Breathe the music
and you will be inspired," our music teacher
says.
The first note bursts from my fingers, my
body, my soul, from the wonderful silence that
fills me and uplifts me. How could I have been
afraid? It is fear that makes us want to make
noise; this evening I realize that noise is the sin
of music. In music, the "frills" are what we
project from our inner noise, from our fear of
silence. My feet are firmly on the ground, my
head is in the clouds and my hands fly over
the keyboard. Every gesture that spells out
music is "sacred". Sounds die out as I play, but
no one notices that they are gone. They die
without dying. They are absorbed in the body
and soul of the listener and go on living there.
The subtle music of inner silence. Music lives in
all of us. The audience and I are now one,
bound by this music that rises from my fin¬
gers like a meadow moved by silence.

meeting place is your heart, the seat of all the

universe advances in harmony with us. It is

die, but they do not die because time does not

"I don't know what a metaphor is. But I

"When you began to play this evening, you
did what all musicians should do: you took a
vow of silence. Only then can each sound
become a hymn to life, an explosion of unimag¬

### 102893: Painting the void: interview with Kumi Sugai

Painting the void
Silence is central to your creative work as
a painter. How would you define it?
Kumi Sugai: As a state of inner emptiness and
fullness, to which speed is an effective mode of
access. When I drive my sports car at almost 200.
kilometres an hour, my mind becomes extremely
vigilant. I know that the slightest error could cost
me my life. As I hurtle along in a straight line, I
feel a sense of void and at the same time absolute
joy. Suddenly I feel free and infinitely powerful.
In 1967 I had a very serious accident I was
nearly killed with my first sports car, which was
red. The one I've got now is white.
It was around that time that you started
painting red and black circles on a white
background . . .
K.S.: I draw them and paint them by hand, taking
all the time I need for them to be perfectly
formed. Alone in my studio, I rediscover the
void that I experienced when driving my car at
top speed.
Working slowly in the studio, do you try to
prolong the heightened experience you have
on the road? Does the straight line of the road
become on your canvas a spiral sucked in by a
black hole, a kind of orbit of silence?
K.S.: You could say that. I need two conditions to
be able to paint: plenty of light and complete
quietness. For me, the ideal studio would be four
white walls, silence, isolation. Even if I accept that
the sight and sounds of nature are beautiful, they
do not inspire me. When I fly above the clouds in
a plane I sometimes admire the colours of the
sunset, but the sight does not give me a creative
shock. What does, is the aircraft's landing on the
runway, the speed of the car on the highway, or

Cadmium red, white and black, which are
also the colours of your sports cars. In what
sense are these colours 'basic' for you?
K.S.: Red, black and white are colours that
everyone knows. Even though the light may

red stays the same. Blue or violet on the other
hand change with the light and so do my states
of mind! I will always present white, red and black

They form a totality, like a body, in which I am

before I acquired my first red sports car. . . .
. . . before your terrible accident in 1967?
K.S.: Yes. At that time I "voided" myself in certain
works, I gave them everything I'd got, whereas I
stayed on the surface with others, in which I put
less of myself. I felt divided. I needed to stand
back. And so I decided to stop doing things that
did not flow from the depths of my being. It was
more honest for other people and for myself.
Since then, with the aid of my brushes and my
primary colours, I have given to others "some¬
thing" that does not yet have a name. Something
that can be immediately given and received, not
only today but in three hundred years' time, or
later. Something that is beyond current human
language. It is impossible and even useless to
express anything in front of one of my paintings.
You can only absorb the shock in silence.
So what you do has little in common with
art, pastor present?
K.S.: Modern society is a society of gadgets, of
the superfluous, where only certain needs such as
food and shelter are considered useful and there¬
fore necessary. Everything else is an extra,
including art, including a painting by a great master.
I am convinced that we are entering a new age
whose first inklings are these buildings with right
angles, pure lines.
This futuristic architecture regarded
by its detractors as the reflection of an inner
void. . .
K.S.: It is in a completely denuded and perhaps
even speechless universe where people will only
communicate via signals that art as I sec it will
become indispensable. When we have got rid of
everything that is unnecessary, art will become
necessary: it alone will be able to support a world
reduced to its simplest form of expression.

### 102894: A Moment of fulfilment

A moment of fulfilment
by Claude Louis-Combet
w ?*
In a celebrated lecture, the German poet Rainer
Maria Rilke spoke of "the great silence that reigns
around things". This close silence exists to calm the
passions and to increase the acuity of our perception of
other creatures. It is a silence of plenitude and grace
that even bursts of speech and laughter cannot spoil.
It is part and parcel of the words we need to hear in
order to fully exist, and of an appearance and a counte¬
nance that encourage communication. Without silence,
there would be no speech.
There is always a moment when time's tensions
slacken and when space retires. We seize this moment
from the intensity of a beloved face or in the profound
harmony that unites us with the contours and rhythm
of a landscape. It is an instant of silence and an instant of
presence in the tumult of life solitude, perhaps, but
without isolation or dislocation.
The contemplative side of our being, which the tur¬
moil of the day has not destroyed, then holds sway and
lets us feel the continuity of our being with the elec¬
tive realities that people our inner lives. All the mystics
have lived with this experience in the background. But
the man whose only faith is in man and whose only
love is in the world, is not necessarily deprived of the
certainty of such a bonding. It is possible in the silence
of stilled passions.

### 102895: An Inner experience

An inner experience
by Jacques Castermane
Mysterious experiences that lead to inner
silence and a sense of life's unity
Silence is usually defined as the absence
of noise. However, it is also an inner
experience, and one that affects each of us on
different levels. The happy, fulfilled person
finds comfort in silence. The old fisherman
sitting for hours on end gazing at the sea and
the farmer who looks out over his land both
know this soothing silence, the fruit of a life of
toil. And wc are all familiar with the emotion
that wells up during the silence, however brief,
that honours the dead. This silence has a special
quality, questioning those who observe it about
the meaning of existence. Anyone who has
entered a temple in Kyoto or a cathedral in
Europe has been struck by it, a silence which
stops the visitor short as soon as the threshold
is crossed. It is disturbing, and even sometimes
threatening, because the visitor feels it to be a
door opening onto mystery.
But the silence of the inner life is even more
profound. When people experience this

silence, they know the unity of life. Such an
experience can be the starting point of spiri¬
tual development.
All experience is ephemeral. But with prac¬
tice, experience of profound silence can
become a permanent condition. It is the state of
being of someone who has achieved maturity,
a mental disposition whereby a person dis¬
cerns, through the conflicts and clashes of
everyday life, an essential unity. Those who
display this unity in their daily lives have pro¬
gressed from adulthood to maturity.
The art of silence opens the doorway fro m
transient to lasting experience.
The promise of beauty
Various moments in life provide the condi¬
tions for such an experience contemplation
of nature or art, for example, or the love that
joins two persons. Wherever the promise of
beauty takes you, there is an opportunity to
experience inner silence.
What is beauty? If we agree with Kant,
beauty is a quality that is innate to an object.
But while it concerns the object, we must
admit that it also concerns the subject. When I
listen to a piece of music, what makes me say
"it's beautiful" is not only the work as it is inter¬
preted, but also and above all the way in which
I am affected by the interpretation. Is this a
matter of taste? It is judgment based on taste,
says Kant. At all events, the word "beautiful"
denotes a quality experienced by a person and
agreeable to that person. Sometimes, when
you listen to a sonata or a symphony that you
have heard a hundred times, the quality that
affects you on this specific occasion is such



that the word "beautiful" is no longer adequate
to express your feelings. This is an experience
in which one's feelings cannot be described by
words.
It is a strange moment during which one
can sometimes even feel alien to the object. It
may happen that there is no more object, no

more symphony, no more orchestra, no more
conductor! In this unexpected experience
there is no longer an object that is distinct fro m
a subject. There is no longer a distinction
between subject and object. At this point you
are gripped by silence.
This silence, this absence of all materiality, is
the inexpressible presence of what lies beyond
the subject-object differentiation, beyond
duality.
What can be said of this silence? This is how
it was once described to me by someone who
had experienced what she called "a curious
moment".
"I was strolling on the sea-shore, watching
the sun go down. I stopped. It was beautiful.
No, suddenly, it had nothing to do with what is
called beautiful. It was peculiar. It was as if I
were immersed in a totally different reality.
Everything within me became astonishingly
calm, and I felt a very great inner force . . .
freedom. I knew nothing, and yet I knew
everything. I no longer belonged to myself,
and at the same time I was in a sense more
myself than I had ever been. A wave of silence
suffused me. I shivered. A shiver of joy and at
the same time a shiver of fear. It was as if I had
rediscovered something known while con¬
fronted with the unknown. Then I heard
someone say, 'It's magnificent, isn't it?' I lis¬
tened, and then it was all over."
At the moment when consciousness,
which makes the distinction between subject
and object, reasserts its ascendancy, "it's all
over." Immediately, the experience fades away
into memory. Few people try to understand
what has really happened during such a
"curious" moment.
These are experiences in which what is called
silence reveals a reality that transcends ordinary
reality. What is discovered is transcendence.
The word "transcendence" has several



meanings. It can denote a reality that is beyond
the space-time horizon, infinitely beyond
human beings and the condition in which they
live. It can also denote an experience that opens

### 102895: An Inner experience

human consciousness to another dimension
of the self. In this case transcendence is imma¬
nent in the individual.
It may seem highly subjective to say that
what is experienced in a state of silence touches
on a reality that surpasses ordinary reality. But
that is the case!
The person as subject is the seat of subjec¬
tive experiences. What interests us when we
talk about inner silence is the person as sub¬
ject. The person as subject cannot be defined
using the objective criteria that enable us to
study the person-object. The person as sub¬
ject is someone who feels, experiences, and
suffers, who knows joy and sadness, well-being
and hardship, confidence and mistrust.
Clearly this subjective side must be rele¬
gated to the background in a science labora¬
tory, where objective measurement is all that
matters. Human feelings may lead to error by
subverting the objectivity demanded by sci¬
entific research.
But when we are concerned with the
person as subject, it is objective criteria that
may lead to error. To say dismissively that
"what you felt is purely subjective!" is to
reduce the human being to an object, a thing!

tening to Mozart or Debussy is also a subjec¬
tive experience. And when tenderness unites
two persons who love each other and when
they become one, this too is a subjective expe¬
rience in which they rediscover the great
silence that rises from the depths of being.
When we go to concerts and museums or
into the world of nature, is it not to enjoy and
repeat the experience of this transcendent "I"?
When we tenderly draw near to the person
we love, is it not to re-live the experience of
immanent transcendence, that of the person
as subject?
The art of silence
But it is not the sunset, nor the piece of music,
nor the loved one that is the cause of the fulfil¬



ment, the inner order and the unity we feel.
These are merely the circumstances that reveal
our innate potentialities. While this experience
lasts, we fleetingly perceive what we are in the
depths oí our being.
This is why it is important to ask oneself
the question, "How can I become what I have
experienced, how can I make the transition
from a short-lived experience to a permanent
state of being?"
The answer is by practising silence, the art
of silence.
Etymologically, the Latin word for art, ars,
means "way of being". It is even "a way of
stretching towards an order dictated by the
gods". In a sense, artists arc always concerned
by transcendence. In the same way, human
beings growing to maturity must take them¬
selves in hand, just as a craftsman takes a piece
of unfinished work in his hands. Self-perfec¬
tion is the goal. Permanent inner silence is the
fruit of this accomplishment.

### 102895: An Inner experience

Western spirituality tends to be so con¬
cerned with the creation of something external
that a longing for inner creation, for the great
peace of the soul, is considered a waste of time
or even an attempt to escape from the real
world.
In the West a person who regularly prac¬
tises an art generally seeks to acquire knowl¬
edge that culminates in a performance. The art
of silence, on the other hand, is directed
towards knowing how to be, achieving the
capacity to feel and to remain calm, peaceful
and serene in the circumstances we face in our
daily lives.

### 102895: An Inner experience

What is the "material" that must be worked
on and shaped by the artisan's hand? It is his
or her own body.
But is it really possible that a physical exer¬
cise can lead humankind to the "greatest
good"? Let us not forget that the body con¬
sists of three factors. It is substance, matter. It is
also form. The substance assumes feminine or
masculine form, youthful or elderly form. But
these two factors are characteristic of a corpse
as well as a living body. They do not define a
living person. Living consists of doing, of
action, of all the actions through which people
are present in the world.
The practice of silence relates to this last
factor. The art of silence consists in raising
actions that are normally unconscious to the
level of conscious experience. The most com¬
monplace act can then become the object of a
specific exercise: sitting down, walking,
breathing. All the arts, from singing to making
pottery, dancing and even archery or fencing,
provide those who practise them regularly
with the opportunity to become themselves.
They provide an opportunity to achieve matu¬
rity, they open the person to immanent tran¬
scendence, which is manifested "silently" in
every aspect of their lives.

### 102915: The City, environment and culture

FEDERICO MAYOR: COMMENTARY
THE CITY,
ENVIRONMENT
AND CULTURE
Atthe dawn of the twenty-first century
urban living poses a major challenge to
which effective, and above all timely,
responses must be found. No treatment can work
unless a diagnosis is made in good time.
It is true that we produce studies, analyses and
reports on the critical situation in cities and the damage
inflicted on the environment and on citizens, but we
have a moral obligation to deal with these problems
by taking preventive action. This "time ethic" is
important if action is to be effective. Any clinical ana¬
lyst knows that a diagnosis should be good without
aspiring to be perfect, for only an autopsy can provide
the perfect diagnosis, and by then it is too late. The
same applies to the environment. Since any process
is potentially irreversible, we must have the courage
to act, however unpopular that action might be, while
treatment is still possible.
If current demographic forecasts turn out to be
correct, by the year 2000 one human being out of
eyery two will be living in a city. By 2035, three thou¬
sand million more people will be living in the urban
settlements that exist today. These forecasts may
not materialize if we succeed in containing popu¬
lation growth. We cannot tell the 250,000 new¬
comers that our planet welcomes each day that there
is no room for them and that we do not want them.
So how can we slow down population growth?
Education especially the education of women
in urban and rural environments is the key factor.
Education can, independently of ideological or reli
gious belief, help to reduce fertility rates rapidly by
something like 50 to 60 per cent.
In December 1993, at a meeting held under the
auspices of UNESCO, UNICEF and the United
Nations, the world's nine most populous countries
(the home of 72 per cent of the world's illiterates
and 56 per cent of world population) agreed that
only education could enable every woman and
every man to control their own destinies. Some of
these countries, including India, have already
decided to increase the percentage of their gross
domestic product set aside for education. This kind
of measure could restrain population growth while
ensuring respect for individual freedom.
Megacities under fire
It is also necessary to improve the quality of life,
above all in rural areas. This is the only way to pre¬
vent migration from these areas to the outskirts of
big cities and even to other countries seen as more
prosperous. To this end we must mobilize solidarity
between and within nations in order to distribute
resources more evenly. If we can boost education-
doubling investment in it and at the same time
improve the quality of life, we shall succeed in con¬
taining population growth.
If we fail to do this, we shall have to build a thou¬
sand cities of three million inhabitants in the next
forty years, twenty-five a year. These figures starkly
demonstrate the extreme magnitude of the urban
phenomenon.

### 102916: The Rune-stones of Jelling

THE RUNE-STONES OF JELLING
by Jens Boel
Runic inscriptions and imposing
burial mounds over a thousand
years old record the encounter
between paganism and Christianity
in a Danish village site that was
registered on UNESCO's World
Heritage List in 1994
JENS BOEL
is head of Unesco's Archives department.
The little village of Jelling, in the heart of
the peaceful countryside of Eastern
Jutland, is dominated by two large burial
mounds shaped like truncated cones.
Between them is a typical Danish village
church, a simple white-washed, medieval
stone building. In front of the church stand
two runic stones. The mounds and rune-
stones form one of the most important
Viking sites in Scandinavia.
The rune-stones were raised more than a
thousand years ago, one by the Viking King
Gonn the Old, and the other by his son, King
Harald Bluetooth. Each of them bears wit¬
ness to an ancient culture and to the transition
from pagan Norse religious beliefs to Chris¬
tianity. Today, many centuries later, we do
not know the full significance of the runic
stones and mounds nor why the site was con¬
structed at all. However, we are not com¬
pletely in the dark. The writing on the stones
can be deciphered and archaeological exca¬
vations have lifted part of the mystery.
The mounds and stones date from the
mid-tenth century and are outstanding
examples of the pagan Nordic culture. The
present church was constructed around
1100, but it was preceded by at least three
wooden churches, all of which were
destroyed by fire. The first church was
probably built by King Harald, who con¬
verted to Christianity around 965.
Ilarald's runic stone is three-sided. It
is the biggest of its kind in Scandinavia (2.5
metres high). Unlike the smaller one, it
stands in its original position, exactly
midway between the two mounds. Its
inscription reads: "King Harald bade this
monument be made in memory of Gorm his
father and Thyra his mother, that Harald
who won for himself all Denmark and
Norway and made the Danes Christian."
The inscription is surmounted by a
carving of a typical Nordic dragon in inter¬
laced ornament. On the southwest face of
the stone the earliest depiction of Christ in

Scandinavia can be seen. He is standing sur¬
rounded by ornaments from which he seems
to emerge, and beneath him runs the final
words of the inscription: "and made the
Danes Christians".
The original position of the smaller stone
is not known, but around 1630 it was moved
to its present location next to Ilarald's stone.
The inscription on it reads: "King Gorm
made this monument to his wife Thyra,
Denmark's ornament."
The message conveyed by these words
has provoked much debate among scholars,
at least since some local people acciden¬
tally discovered a burial chamber in the
north mound when they were searching for
water during the summer of 1820.
FACTS AND FICTION
Some facts are incontrovertible. During the
reigns of Gorm and his son, Harald Blue¬
tooth, Jelling was a royal manor, although it
is uncertain whether the kings resided there
permanently. Both father and son ruled a
realm known as Denmark, and Harald
claimed to be the ruler of Norway as well.
King Gorm erected a stone in Jelling in
memory of his wife, Thyra, and Harald did
the same for both of his parents after
Gorm's death in 958. There is every prob¬
ability that Gorm was buried in the north
mound.
It may be assumed that the two mounds,
today regarded as excellent feats of engi¬
neering, were laid out by Gorm after
Thyra 's death as a joint funerary monu¬
ment. However, the south mound was only
completed in 972, and it contains no burial
chamber. Archaeological excavations have
led to the discovery of a grave chamber in
the first wooden church, containing the
skeletal remains of a man. The excavations
revealed that the burial and the building
were established at the same time and that
the man in the grave had been buried else¬
where once before. Archaeologists conclude
that King Harald probably transferred his
father's bones to the impressive wooden
church he built after he had officially intro¬
duced Christianity to Denmark. By giving
King Gorm a Christian funeral Harald made
a clear religious and political demonstra¬
tion. As for Queen Thyra, no trace of her
grave has yet been found, and the mystery
of where she was buried remains.
A SITE OF NATIONAL
IM PORTAN CE
Every new generation interprets history in a
different way corresponding to the kind of
world and problems that confront it. In the
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the
national importance of the Jelling site was
stressed. Here could be seen in a clear and
instructive way the emergence ofDenmark as
a unified kingdom with the succession
passing from father to son. Christianization
was also emphasized as evidence of a major
victory for civilization and progress.
Today these views are regarded as far
too simplistic. It is not at all clear what the
notion "Denmark" actually meant at that
time. Although it is generally accepted
that the Christian faith was formally intro¬
duced in Denmark during the reign of King

pagan peasant traditions persisted for cen¬

play an important role. The Danes did not
become Christians overnight.
It would be tempting in 1996 to see the
Jelling monuments as evidence of a peaceful
meeting of cultures, a transition to Chris¬
tianity that deliberately included pagan
mounds. After having been received into
Christianity, King Harald may have wished
to establish an awe-inspiring memorial by
fusing the pagan monuments to the new
Christian monument, the church. As the
leading expert on the Jelling monuments,
Knud J. Krogh, has written: ". . . con¬
sciously or unconsciously the new monu¬
ment becomes an expression of continuity in
the midst of religious change".
Tili: VIKING SAGA
Until recently the traditional image of the
Vikings as presented in generations of
Schoolbook» was that of bloodthirsty
invaders who plundered and burned monas¬
teries in England, France or Ireland. This
was primarily due to the fact that the dom¬
inant historical sources were written by
monks and other victims of Viking pirates.
Today it has become widely acknowl¬
edged that the Vikings were much more
than warriors and pirates. Most Scandina¬
vians in the Viking age, c. 750-1050, lived
rather undramatically and peacefully, cul¬
tivating the land, breeding their animals,
plying their trades, doing business and so on.
But it is also true that adventurous travel¬
ling was an important part of the Viking
civilization. Among the Vikings were kings
engaged in high politics, engineers who
built castles and bridges, merchants who
traded with Russia or Ireland, and explorers
who colonized the Faroe Islands, Iceland
and Greenland. Vikings reached America
around the year 1000, the first Europeans
to do so.
The Vikings became masters of the sea
because of their sophisticated ships. They
travelled, bargained and plundered and some¬
times settled in the lands they discovered.
For three centuries they left their mark in
the Northern and Western hemispheres as
far away from Scandinavia as Byzantium.
Ilarald's runic stone in Jelling, on the
other hand, testifies how cultural influence
from the South, in the shape of Christianity, .
changed the Viking civilization by blending
with traditional beliefs and gradually domi¬
nating and taking over from them. Pagan
beliefs were defeated by Christianity
because the latter appeared more powerful
than the traditional religion. For the Vikings
conversion was probably a way of coping with
the strong continental European powers.
Thanks to contemporary written sources it is
possible to date the official Danish conversion
rather precisely and to give a fairly accu¬
rate account of how it happened.
At a feast at King Ilarald's court one
evening around 965 a priest named Poppo
was present. He claimed that the Vikings
worshipped false gods and that there was
only one true God who was one with Jesus
Christ and the I toly Spirit. King Harald asked
whether he was prepared to prove his state¬
ment by undergoing an ordeal. Without hesi¬
tation Poppo said that he was. The King then
ordered the priest to be taken into custody.
The following morning he heated a very heavy
piece of iron and then ordered the priest to
carry it, thus bearing witness to his Christian
faith. Poppo grasped the glowing iron and
carried it as long as the King wished. He then
showed that his hand was uninjured, thereby
convincing everybody present about the truth
of the Christian faith. The upshot was that
King Harald converted to Christianity and
commanded his people to reject pagan idols.
This is the story according to contempo¬
rary accounts. Several historians have argued
that the incident was contrived by Harald
and some of his close advisors in order to jus¬
tify a conversion believed to be a political
necessity. The German King Otto I had been'
crowned as Roman Emperor in 962 and had
thus become the supreme secular master of
Christianity. He had already taken measures
showing that he was not prepared to respect
the sovereignty of King Ilarald's pagan
kingdom. In order to show the powerful
Christian Church that it could count on him,
Harald may have converted as a way of coping
with this potential threat.

WORLD TOURISM: WHERE NEXT?

mountain range.
FRANCE BEQUETTE
is a Franco-American
journalist
specializing in
environmental
questions.
When some 2,000 years ago
the Greek geographer
Strabo described how the priests
of Crocodilopolis in Egypt waited
for the arrival of Roman "tourists"
before they began the ritual animal
sacrifice to feed the sacred croco¬
diles of the god Sebek, little did he
know that tourism was destined to
become so popular that one day
half a billion people would be vis¬
iting the earth's most beautiful
places.
World Tourism Organization
(WTO) forecasts indicate that by
the year 2000 international tourist
arrivals will total approximately
661 million, an annual growth rate
of 3.8 per cent. The hundreds of
millions of tourists who each year
travel in their own countries can
be added to this figure. How can
environmental protection, the bal¬
anced exploitation of natural
resources, equitable access to
the world heritage major chal¬
lenges of our time be reconciled
with the expansion of the tourist
industry?
A CHILD OF PROSPERITY
Tourism is undeniably a powerful
tool for development, but the forms
it has taken so far have often been
criticized for such negative
impacts as excessive use of land,
water and energy, the production
of was te, and heavy pressure on the
social environment and the historic
and cultural heritage.
The Council of Europe
Europe is the world's most impor- '
tant region for "generating" and
receiving tourists considers that
one reason for these negative
impacts is lack of planning and
management. Whether tourism has
good or bad effects will hinge at
least partly on what management
initiatives are taken by the tourist-
generating and receiving countries.
The major advantage of tourism
is that it brings in currency. In 1992
the turnover from tourism was
some $3.1 trillion, and the tourist
industry employed around 130 mil¬
lion people, or one in fourteen
workers worldwide. In a recent
study entitled Tourisme et envi¬
ronnement en Méditerranée
("Tourism and Environment in the
Mediterranean Region") Robert
Lanquar notes that tourism is pri¬
marily a social phenomenon. "In
comparison to the main traditional
areas of economic activity, tourism
is not a response to people's basic
needs but to a lifestyle made pos¬
sible by the prosperity of broad
social strata in the industrialized
nations. It is a recent historical
phenomenon."

everyone has the right to go any¬

track, too massive an influx of visi¬
tors can harm the plant and animal
life and even the social fabric of the
regions they frequent. "Too many
of the people, companies and even
politicians involved in tourism," says
the Council of Europe, "are only
interested in maximizing short-term
profits . " All too often they succeed
in circumventing the laws protecting
the environment. Such "dispensa¬
tions" pose an extremely difficult
problem.
THE RIGHT CHOICE
The world's natural and cultural
heritage is an inalienable posses¬
sion that should be transmitted
intact to future generations. Many
states that lack exploitable nat¬
ural resources depend on tourism
for a considerable percentage of
their income. But tourism must be
carefully planned and controlled
if it is to be sustainable.
The mountain kingdom of
Bhutan, and the Maldive Islands in
the Indian Ocean have been studied
by Edward Inskeep for the United
Nations Environment Programme
(UNEP). Bhutan, which is located
high on the eastern slopes of the
Himalayas and has a Buddhist cul¬
ture, possesses a chain of fortified
monasteries and palaces. In 1995
only 5,500 tourists from non-neigh¬
bouring countries (exclusively in
organized groups) were allowed into
the country. Their average stay was
nine days, and they spent a min¬
imum of 200 dollars per day and
per person. Tourists in Bhutan stick
to carefully planned routes , and new
buildings made to house them must
comply with the canons of tradi¬
tional architecture and be equipped
to treat sewage. In 1987 a commis¬
sion investigated the negative influ¬
ence of tourists on the religious
practices of young people and made
a number temples out of bounds to'
foreigners.
The Maldives, a small chain of
islands in the Indian Ocean, is a
Muslim country with a limited land
area. Income from tourism repre¬
sents nearly 20 per cent of Gross
National Product. Holiday instal¬
lations for tourists have been set
up on uninhabited islands to pre¬
vent the social and cultural life of
the local population (less than
200,000 people) from suffering.
THREATS TO THE
MEDITERRANEAN
Almost one third of the world's
tourists are visitors to the Mediter¬
ranean countries, where the growth-
rate of tourism in some coastal
areas has been spectacular. Malta is
a case in point. In 1993, this small
island (with an area 316 km2 and
350,000 inhabitants, it has one of
the world's highest population den¬
sities) received 1,063,069 visitors
who spent an estimated $542 mil¬
lion.
The increase in numbers, espe¬
cially in the summer months,
imposes considerable strain on the
supply ofwater, which is very scarce
on Malta it has been estimated
that tourists use twice as much
water as the permanent residents.
Desalination plants consume a great
deal of energy, and a new power sta-
tion is being built to meet the.
increased demand. Most of the
sewage is flushed untreated into the
sea, and some sandy beaches often
risk becoming polluted. Tourist
pressure on historic sites and local
communities is also very strong. The
city of Mdina, for example, is vis¬
ited by an average of 1 ,500 tourists
each day, a high influx that is
causing various kinds of harm.

The Maltese government has
taken steps to plan tourism devel¬
opment and manage access to sites
and monuments in order to respect
their carrying capacity, a concept
defined by the World Tourism
Organization as "the level of vis¬
itor use an area can accommodate
with high levels of satisfaction for
visitors and few negative effects on

A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE
UNESCO is aware of the need to
strike a balance between tourism,
culture and development, and
encourages study and action in four
areas: defence and promotion of
the cultural heritage and cultural
identity; protection of the natural
environment against inroads from
tourism; encouragement of a form

of tourism that respects the social,
cultural and natural environment
and provides a basis for develop¬
ment; extension of cultural tourism
activities that may generate income
and jobs, especially for young
people in developing countries.
A World Conference on Sus¬
tainable Tourism, whose sponsors
included UNESCO, via its Man and
the Biosphere Programme (MAB)
and World Heritage Centre, was
held on 27 and 28 April 1995 in
Lanzarote in the Canary Islands
(Spain). The 500 participants
adopted a Charter for Sustainable
Tourism which emphasizes that
"tourism is ambivalent, since it can
contribute positively to socio-eco¬
nomic and cultural achievement,
[but also] to the degradation of
the environment and the loss of
local identity, and should there¬
fore be approached with a global
methodology".
Beautiful places are bound to
attract visitors. Everyone involved in
tourism must act responsibly. Oth¬
erwise the only solution will be to
close threatened sites and monu¬
ments to visitors and make copies of
them, as France has done for the
prehistoric caves of Lascaux or
else to organize virtual-reality

Tourism for peace
A
t a time when Israel, Palestine and
their Arab neighbours are involved in
I a peace process, it is vital that the
heritage of these countries, among the
richest in the world, should become a factor
in cultural, economic and social development
and a pivot of understanding and exchange
for people all over the world."
These words were spoken in October
1994 by Gilbert Trigano, until 1993 presi¬
dent of the internationally known tourist
organization Club Méditerranée, when pre¬
senting to Heads of State at the Middle
East-North African Economic Summit a pro¬
ject for a university of tourism and culture for
peace. The Summit, held in Casablanca under
the presidency of Morocco's King Hassan,
gave the project an enthusiastic welcome.
In all probability, the first two branches of
the university will be located in Israel and
Palestine.
The project was endorsed by King
Hassan, and Tunisia, Italy and France have
already expressed a desire to take part. A
three-year course involving 900 hours of
coursework per year will be offered to stu¬
dents via satellite television links, which will
considerably reduce costs. Teachers will visit
each branch campus in turn so as to make
personal contact with their students. Theo¬
retical studies will alternate with paid training
periods in the tourist industry totalling three
or four months a year.
The first year will concentrate on the basics
common to all jobs in the tourist industry and
will emphasize the importance of the cultural role
of tourism. The second and third years will con¬
centrate on the main fields of activity in the
industry, with the final semester being devoted
to the goal of "becoming an entrepreneur". The
television equipment is being tested this spring,
and the university will "open for business" in
September.
In recognition of the fact that this ini¬
tiative is in line with Unesco's goals, on 25
June 1995 Director-General Federico Mayor
signed a convention-of co-operation with the
"Association en faveur du Tourisme et de la
Culture pour la Paix" (Association of Tourism
and Culture for Peace), which was also ini¬
tialled by the Secretary-General of the World
Tourism Organization, Antonio Enriquez Sav-
ignac. Gilbert Trigano feels a mixture of hope
and anxiety. Anxiety because this is the first
interstate operation of its kind; hope because
of its potential for promoting understanding
and peace.

Europe, the United States and Japan. When certain
products intended for food, medicine or other uses
have been extracted from the seaweed, the waste
is discarded. Over 30 per cent of the people in the
region suffer from iodine deficiency disorders, yet a
variety of seaweeds are rich in iodine. Instead of
depending on drugs sent by the World Health Orga¬
nization to fight these diseases, Pauli suggests pro¬
viding the population with iodine by using seaweed
residues with other seaweed as an additive to cattle

CALLING
ALL FROG-LOVERS
For the second year running, a French association
called "Espaces naturels de France", has been trying
to save batrachians (frogs and toads), which in
spring emerge from their winter shelters and hop to
their mating grounds under cover of darkness. Many
of the unfortunate amphibians are run over when
crossing roads. The association has appealed to all
frog lovers to identify crossing points and signpost
them for motorists. Information is centralized in a
"frog clearing house". In Germany, Switzerland and
eastern France special underground "frogways" have
been built at considerable cost. Frogs and toads
are excellent indicators of a wetland's state of health,
and scientists are concerned about their declining
numbers worldwide.
10 YEARS OF ACTION
TO SAFEGUARD
THE OZONE LAYER
The Convention on the Protection of the Ozone
Layer, signed in Vienna (Austria) in 1985, calls for
the phasing out of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and
other chemical ozone-depleting substances (ODS)
that destroy the vital veil of ozone that protects us
from the sun's damaging ultraviolet radiation. An
international effort in this direction is being co-ordi¬
nated by the World Meteorological Organization
(WMO) and the United Nations Environment Pro¬
gramme (UNEP). In 1987, the Montreal Protocol was
adopted. Among its requirements are an eventual
50 percent reduction in the use of five CFCs before
the year 2000. A $240-million Multilateral Fund has
been created to help developing countries eliminate
.CFCs and ODS. By 1995 elimination was well
underway in the developed countries and there had
been some progress in the developing countries.
However, the overall decrease masked a 46 per cent
increase in developing-country CFC consumption
and a world increase in HCFC (hydrochlorofluorocar-
bons) consumption of 130 per cent.
WASTE NOT, WANT NOT
Gunter Pauli, director of the Zero Emissions Research
Institute (ZERI) of the United Nations University
(see page 43 of our March 1995 issue), has come up
with a way of using wastes in some parts of Africa.

THE WHALE-WATCHING
INDUSTRY
Whale migration sites are attracting increasing num¬
bers of tourists. Whale watching is growing by nearly
10 per cent annually in Argentina, Brazil, the
Caribbean, Mexico, Japan, New Zealand, South Africa,
Norway and the United Kingdom. In Japan, for
example, 55,000 tourists went whale-watching on
the high seas in 1994, netting over $200 million for
21 communities that make a living from this new
kind of photo safari. But too much intrusive obser¬
vation by eco-tourists from boats or aircraft may be
dangerously stressful to the marine mammals.
A DISCREET
MONKEY
In 1984 British ecologist Mike Harrison discovered a
monkey hitherto unknown to scientists, the sun-
tailed guenon (Ceropithecus solatus) in Gabon's
"forêt des Abeilles" (forest of the bees). Known to
hunters as Mbaya or Makina, the monkey is extremely
skilful in concealing itself. It feeds on plants and
roots, like gorillas, but also on insects. By eating
fruit, it helps to broadcast seeds and regenerate
the forest. As an endangered species, it has been
fully protected under Gabonese law after a campaign
led by primatologist Jean-Pierre Gautier, director of
studies at the Makandé Research Centre.
KARIBA'S TROUBLED
WATERS
David Manyonga, a Pan African News Agency corre¬
spondent, reports on the catastrophic situation in
Kariba, a Zimbabwean town on the northern edge of
the world's largest artificial lake. Established for a
population of 5,000 persons in the 1950s at the
same time as the lake, the town now has 25,000
inhabitants. "Our sewage," says the head of the
town council, "was supposed to be treated then
emptied Into the Zambezi River below the dam, but
the treatment machines broke down." Untreated
sewage, iron and phosphates are now being dumped
into the lake, and aquatic plants like the water
hyacinth and Kariba grass [Salvinia mosesta), are
impeding navigation. The fish supply is also affected:
in 1995 more than 40 tonnes of contaminated fis h
had to be destroyed. Tourism, an important source
of income, is threatened, as well as the health of
the townspeople.
MIGRATING MONARCHS
Milions of orange and black monarch butterflies
{Danaus plexippus) migrate every year from Canada (a
5,600-kilometre trip) and the United States to winter
in the forests of Mexico. The winter of 1995-1996
was particularly cold and snowy, and a vast number
of the butterflies died. Specialists are not unduly
worried so far, for the butterflies are extremely prolific.
However, there are fears that increased logging in
the monarchs' wintering sites pose a threat by
removing the protective cover that shields the but¬
terflies from periodical cold waves.
THE INDONESIAN
CORNUCOPIA
Indonesia's 17,000 islands are home to 10 per cent
of the world's remaining rain forests, 10 per cent of
all plant species, 12 per cent of all mammal species,
16 per cent of all reptile and amphibian species, 17
per cent of all bird species and 25 per cent of all the
world's freshwater and marine fish species. Scien¬
tists estimate that 30 per cent of its plants and 90
per cent of its animals and insects have not yet
been studied, identified or documented. Many are
unique to the area. To protect its abundant biodi-
I versity Indonesia has begun cataloguing and moni-
I toring its rich biological resources as well as training
¿ researchers.

OUR CREATIVE DIVERSITY:
CULTURE AND DEVELOPMENT IN
THE 21ST CENTURY
An unprecedented report on the rela¬
tionship between culture and devel¬
opment on a world-wide basis has
been completed by the independent
World Commission on Culture and
Development, chaired by former
United Nations Secretary-General
Javier Pérez de Cuéllar. The product of
three years work by the Commission,
which was set up at Unesco in 1992,
the report is entitled Our Creative
Diversity and is now available in book
form from Unesco*. "Development
begins in human culture," notes Mr.
Pérez de Cuéllar.
In addition to theoretical con¬
siderations on the cultural dimen¬
sion of development, the report
makes specific proposals for cultural
and development policies. Among
its recommendations are: drawing
up a list of cultural rights which are
not protected by existing interna¬
tional treaties; defining the bases of
a new global ethics; and organizing
an international forum of reflection
on violence and pornography in the
media.
In choosing the title of the
report, the Commission wanted to
emphasize its support for diversity,
its concern for common welfare and
the need to invent a new model for
development.

DEVELOPMENT DIALOGUE
Development priorities and problems
are critically discussed by interna¬
tional contributors in Development
Dialogue, ajournai published twice a
year (in English) by the Dag Ham-
marskjöld Foundation of Uppsala
(Sweden). The first issue of 1995,
entitled "Making National Drug Poli¬
cies a Development Priority", con¬
tains a strategy paper and 6 country
studies (on Norway, Sri Lanka,
Bangladesh, Australia, India and
Mexico). An editorial notes that
"about 2.5 billion peopleor half
the world's populationcontinue
to be denied their right to health",
that "the global pharmaceutical
industry is estimated to turn over
about $220 billion annually, out of
which Third World countries, with
three-quarters of the world's popu¬
lation, account for only $44 billion"
and that "about 90% of the world's
production of pharmaceuticals orig¬
inates in industrialized countries,
which also account for 80% of con¬
sumption".
Issue no. 2 of 1995 focuses on
the funding of social and economic
development. Among the contents
are the opening address and final
report of a conference held in Kam¬
pala (Uganda) in 1995 on "the role
of independent funds as intermedi¬
aries for channelling money for social
and economic development", and
case studies from Ecuador, the Philip¬
pines, and several African countries.
"Plant genetic resources and agri¬
cultural biodiversity" is the theme
of the first issue of 1996, which is
still in press.

BANGLADESH: AN ACTION PLAN
FOR CHILDREN
As a contribution to Bangladesh's
national action plan to improve child
health, UNICEF, the United Nations
Children's Fund, has earmarked $250
million ($50 million per year) between
1996 and 2000. One of the first
nations to ratify the United Nations
Convention on the Rights of the Child
(3 August 1990), Bangladesh
launched the plan, comprising 26
objectives to be achieved before the
year 2000, in 1992. The objectives
include reducing the infant mortality
rate from 84 to 50 per thousand and
the malnutrition rate of children under
five from 68 to 38 per cent, increasing
primary school enrolment from 81 to
95 per cent, and reducing the rate of
maternal mortality.
UN LAUNCHES PROGRAMME TO
BOOST AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT
On 15 March 1996, Mr. Boutros
Boutros Ghali, Secretary-General of
the United Nations, launched a multi-
billion dollar programme to boost
development in Africa over a ten-year
period.
Coming on top of a series of UN
actions carried out in the last 20
years by the United Nations to pro¬
mote development in Africa (which
contains 33 of the world's 48 least
advanced countries), the UN
System-wide Special Initiative on
Africa is unprecedented in its scale.
It is the UN's most significant mobi¬
lization of support for the people
of a single continent and its largest
co-ordinated action. The estimated
cost of implementing the Initiative
is $25 billion. The World Bank has
agreed to lead in mobilizing over 85
per cent of this amount, the bulk of
which will go to improving basic edu¬
cation and health.
The Special Initiative comprises
14 components, grouped into four
themes reflecting development priori¬
ties defined by African governments
and the international community.
Theme one is called Give Devel¬
opment a Chance. It consists of
actions designed to create a propi¬
tious climate for development by
contributing to peace-building;
improving the mobilization of Africa's
internal resources and encouraging
external support; stimulating
domestic savings and investment;
and facilitating access to informa¬
tion technology.
Theme two is named New Hope
for the Upcoming Generation. The
largest resource commitment of the
Special Initiative ($12.5 to $15.5 bil¬
lion), it seeks to ensure basic edu¬
cation for all African children, increase
the provision of health care and
encourage job creation and the devel¬
opment of sustainable livelihoods.
Theme three, Strengthening the
Capacity for Governance, is designed
to expand capacities for transparent,
responsible and effective gover¬
nance, to help build independent
judicial systems, support the func¬
tioning of parliaments and electoral
processes and strengthen pluralist
forces (unions, women's organiza¬
tions and workers' associations).
The fourth theme, Urgency and
Survival Issues, includes pro¬
grammes designed to provide long-
term food security and drought man¬
agement (reducing land degradation,
improving soil quality and increasing
desertification control) as well as
ensuring household water security
for drinking and sanitation for at
least 80 per cent of the population.
While taking part in each of the
14 components of the Special Ini¬
tiative for Africa, Unesco will be the
lead agency in four programmes:
Basic Education for all African Chil¬
dren, Communications for Peace-
building, Harnessing Information
Technology for Development, and
Solar Energy.
NORTH-SOUTH SOLIDARITY
From 27 to 29 October 1995 In Vichy
(France) some 1,500 supporters of
France's Catholic Committee against
Hunger and for Development (CCFD)
and more than fifty of its partners
from the Third World attended a
meeting held to discuss North-
South partnership In development.
The meeting divided into 17 work¬
shops, each of which examined a
specific example of international sol¬
idarity in a local development initia¬
tive. Among the participants were
the 1980 Nobel Peace-prize winner,
Adolfo Pérez Esquivel (Argentina),
Milica Lucic-Cavic, former president
of the Centre for Anti-war Action of
Belgrade, and the African historian
Joseph Ki-Zerbo (Burkina-Faso).

Representatives of social, economic
and cultural life from the European
Union countries and the entire
Mediterranean region met in Barcelona
for the Forum Civil Euromed organized
by the Catalan Institute of the
Mediterranean from 29 November to
1 December 1995. The topics dis¬

5> NEW HORIZONS OF ARAB MUSIC
Isabelle Leymarie talks to
ARCEL KHALIFE
What kind of music do you remember
hearing as a child?
Marcel Khalife: My paternal grandfather,
who was a mason, played the ney a reed
flute with seven holes superbly and had
a beautiful voice. When I was a child I
would climb on his shoulders and shake
the tassel of his tarbush to the rhythm of
the Lebanese folk songs that he hummed.
The soft sounds he produced from his
ney during family gatherings filled me
with joy.
In the streets of the village where I
was born, Amchit, near Byblos, gypsies
danced and played to the sound of the
bouzouk, a string instrument, and the
tabla, a drum. My father and grandfa¬
ther would invite them home to drink
arak, and then the fun would begin. My
grandfather accompanied them. I always
awaited these occasions eagerly and
longed to learn their songs.
My uncle gave me a record-player and
that opened up all kinds of possibilities
for broadening my musical horizons. I lis¬
tened to Beethoven, Mozart and other
classical composers but also to songs by
the Egyptian musician Sayed Darwish,
and recordings by the Rabbani brothers,
who were of Lebanese origin, and many
other tunes.
Religious music also had a very strong
influence on me. St. Elisha's church
echoed to splendid a capella monodic
chant; that of the Marist brothers to rich
polyphonic melodies. I belonged to the
choir, which was accompanied by a har¬
monium. And then, of course, I would
hear the vibrant voice of the muezzin
rise from a nearby mosque.
I have always felt nostalgic for the
sounds of my village, and in my composi¬
tions I try to rediscover their melodies,
which are buried deep within me.
When did you form AI Mayadine?
M. K.: I had just completed my studies at
the National Conservatory of Beirut when
the Lebanon war broke out. I wondered
whether there was any point in writing
music at a time when death was sweeping
through the country. However, I was
looking for a way of saving myself and
others from the horror around us. I regis¬
tered my protest through music. I got
some other musicians together and started
Al Mayadine (plural of the Arab word
midan, the name for the village square
where festivities are held). We have per¬
formed in the world's most war-torn
regions. Our music rose above the cannon's
roar, and I'd like to think we were able to
bring solace to a few wounded souls. On
the world's theatre stages it was also a way
of communicating with another language
than that of violence.
How do you see the role of the udin
Arab music today?
M. K.: The evolution of Arab music is
forcing us to redefine the functions and
possibilities of our musical instruments.
How can we get them to express them¬
selves in an original, modern fashion? What
musical paths should we trace out for our
contemporaries and future generations?
Why shouldn't we re-examine our methods
of writingmusic and our itd-playing tech¬
niques? How can we improve the instru¬
ment? I am trying to create a family for it
comparable to that formed by European
string instruments such as the violin, the-
mandolin or the balalaika. It would, for
example, be possible to widen the neck
to take as many as twelve strings, which
would extend the instrument's possibili¬
ties. Could we obtain a more "musical"
sound by playing the ud with the fingers
instead of a plectrum? What new timbres
or registers could be produced by changing
the size of the body or the soundboard,
or by lengthening the neck? We could also
create a bass ud, with longer and thicker
strings like those on a bass guitar, and by
getting rid of the double strings. That
would make writing music for the ud dif¬
ferent. I have tried my hand at some of
these experiments in my most recent com¬
position, "Jadal"1, which is an ud duet.
The two uris in the group are tuned dif¬
ferently and their registers are distinct.
Since I proposed new ways of using the
ud, we had to rehearse a lot.
What are you doing at the moment?
M. K.: Al Mayadine is continuing its inter-
national tour, first in London, then in
Tunisia and Japan before returning to
Beirut. Recordings of three of my com¬
positions, "Elegy for the Orient", "Return
Symphony" and "Concerto for ud and
orchestra" will be appearing soon. The
score of "Jadal" is going to be published
in Lebanon, as well as an ud handbook
which will present new forms of writing
for ud solos, duets, trios and quartets.
'Jadal' contains sophisticated
counterpoint and occasional unexpected
harmonies. Is that your personal
contribution or are similar techniques
found in traditional Arab music?

### 102918: Isabelle Leymarie talks to Marcel Khalifé

Lebanese-born Marcel Khalife is one of the greatest
living exponents of the ud (a lute tcith strings that
are plucked) und the architect ofu revival of
traditional Arab music. His group, Al Mayadine
(Marcel Khalife: ud, Charbel Rouhana: ud, Ali El
Khatib: riqq, Abboud El Saadi: bass guitar), is
currently on an international tour. Left, Marcel
Khalife in concert (Paris, February 1996).

M. K.: Harmony and counterpoint have
long existed in Arab music. In the four¬
teenth century the Arab historian Ibn
Khaldun described, in the chapter of his
Muqaddima devoted to music, a musical
ensemble consisting of a hundred-odd
instruments, including woodwind, brass,
plucked or bowed strings, percussion,
etc, which played harmonies like a sym¬
phony orchestra.
But Arab music, like all other kinds of
music, has been exposed to a variety of
influences. When I began to study musi-
cology, I applied Western analytical tech¬
niques to the different forms of tradi¬
tional Arab music. I discovered that these
forms had already achieved a certain
degree of perfection before reaching
Europe. Music schools already existed
in the ninth century: the composer and
singer Ziryab, the head musician at the
court of Cordoba, founded the first con¬
servatory of music in Andalusia.
How do today's Arab composers see
the future of their music?
M. K.: One of the questions we are asking
is to what extent we are still worthy of
our musical heritage. Studying it again
may teach us much that would be useful
for the future. If our music had con¬
tinued to make progress, as it did in the
past in Andalusia, we would be riding
high today. The loss of Andalusia caused
a profound break in continuity.
After that there was a long period
when nothing moved in the closed world of
Arab music. "Jadal" reflects my interest
in all kinds of music. I have tried to open
up new horizons, but with a familiar land¬
scape as my starting point. I draw inspi¬
ration from maqams (modes) and tradi¬
tional Arab rhythms, while moving
towards new forms of expression and aes¬
thetic concepts. "Jadal" is a very free
composition which ignores the technical
restrictions imposed by the rid.
Your music sometimes brings to mind
Renaissance madrigals and motets. Is that
because the guitar is a derivative of the ud
and that some European traditions spring
from the Arab-Andalusian tradition, or is it
a deliberate choice on your part?
M. K.: There has always been an interpén¬
étration between Oriental and Western
music. In music, melody, rhythm and
musical and cultural traditions in general,
it is impossible to put civilizations in a hier¬
archical order. Composers such as Borodin,
Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Bartok,
Ravel, Saint-Saëns and Debussy dug deep
into the folklore of Oriental peoples . The
German lied, for example, came from the
Arab muashah it is an instrumental
muashah. Even symphonic composition
has been influenced by Arab music. At the
same time, great Oriental composers such
as Aram Khachaturian, who knew the
Western tradition as well as their own, con¬
tributed to the enrichment of their national
culture. Music knows no frontiers.
My life in music has been shaped by a
variety of influences and I am receptive to
everything beautiful and new that music
from anywhere in the world can bring me.
But the starting point of my work is an
ancient language, that of the Lebanese tra¬
dition. I try to strike a balance between
two trends that are threatening Arab
music: on the one hand extreme conser¬
vatism, which rejects all forms of change,
and on the other extreme modernism which
tries to cut itself off from tradition. My
music is generally considered to be clas¬
sical Arab music, but of a new kind. I

### 102920: Looking at life with the eyes of a child

Looking at life with the eyes of a child
by Henri Matisse
French painter (1869-1954)
nlf
Creation is the artist's true function; where there is no cre¬
ation there is no art. But it would be a mistake to ascribe this
creative power to an inborn talent. In art, the genuine creator
is not just a gifted being, but a man who has succeeded in
arranging, for their appointed end, a complex of activities, of
which the work of art is the outcome.
Thus, for the artist creation begins with vision. To see is
itself a creative operation, requiring an effort. Everything that
we see in our daily life is more or less distorted by acquired
habits, and this is perhaps more evident in an age like ours
when the cinema posters and magazines present us every
day with a flood of ready-made images which are to the eye
what prejudices are to the mind.
The effort needed to see things without distortion takes
something very like courage: and this courage is essential
to the artist, who has to look at everything as though he
saw it for the first time: he has to look at life as he did when
he was a child and, if he loses that faculty, he cannot express
himself in an original, that is, a personal way.
To take an example. Nothing, I think, is more difficult for
a true painter than to paint a rose, because before he can do
so, he has first to forget all the roses that were ever painted.
I have often asked visitors who came to see me at Vence
whether they had noticed the thistles by the side of the
road. Nobody had seen them; they would all have recog¬
nized the leaf of an acanthus on a Corinthian capital, but the
memory of the capital prevented them from seeing the thistle
in nature. The first step towards creation is to see every¬
thing as it really is, and that demands a constant effort. To
create is to express what we have within ourselves. Every
genuine creative effort comes from within. We have also to
nourish our feeling, and we can do so only with materials
derived from the world about us. This is the process whereby
the artist incorporates and gradually assimilates the external
world within himself, until the object of his drawing has
become like a part of his being, until he has it within him and
can project it on to the canvas as his own creation.
When I paint a portrait, I come back again and again to my
sketch and every time it is a new portrait that I am painting:
not one that I am improving, but a quite different one that I
am beginning over again; and every time I extract from the
same person a different being.
In order to make my study more complete, I have often
had recourse to photographs of the same person at different
ages; the final portrait may show that person younger or
under a different aspect from that which he or she presents
at the time of sitting, and the reason is that that is the
aspect which seemed to me the truest, the one which
revealed most of the sitter's real personality.
Thus a work of art is the climax of a long work of prepa¬
ration. The artist takes from his surroundings everything
that can nourish his internal vision, either directly, when
the object he is drawing is to appear in his composition, or by
analogy. In this way he puts himself into a position where he
can create. He enriches himself internally with all the forms
he has mastered and which he will one day set to a new
rhythm.
It is in the expression of this rhythm that the artist's work
becomes really creative. To achieve it, he will have to sift
rather than accumulate details, selecting for example, from all
possible combinations, the line that expresses most and gives
life to the drawing: he will have to seek the equivalent terms by
which the facts of nature are transposed into art.
In my "Still Life with Magnolia", I painted a green marble
table red: in another place I had to use black to suggest
the reflection of the sun on the sea; all these transpositions
were not in the least matters of chance or whim, but were the
result of a series of investigations, following which these
colours seemed to me to be necessary, because of their rela¬
tion to the rest of the composition, in order to give the
impression I wanted. Colours and lines are forces, and the
secret of creation lies in the play and balance of those forces.
In the chapel at Vence, which is the outcome of earlier
researches of mine, I have tried to achieve that balance of
forces; the blues, greens and yellows of the windows compose
a light within the chapel which is not strictly any of the
colours used, but is the living product of their mutual
blending; this light made up of colours is intended to play
upon the white and black-stencilled surface of the wall
facing the windows, on which the lines are purposely set
wide apart. The contrast allows me to give the light its max¬
imum vitalizing value, to make it the essential element,
colouring, warming and animating the whole structure, to
which it is desired to give an impression of boundless space
despite its small dimensions. Throughout the chapel, every
line and every detail contributes to that impression.
That is the sense, so it seems to me, in which art may be
said to imitate nature, namely, by the life that the creative
worker infuses into the work of art. The work will then
appear as fertile and as possessed of the same power to
thrill, the same resplendent beauty as wc find in works of
nature.
Great love is needed to achieve this effect, a love capable
of inspiring and sustaining that patient striving towards
truth, that glowing warmth and that analytic profundity
that accompany the birth of any work of art. But is not love
the origin of all creation?
(Text recorded by Régine Pernoud)

Window onto
the Beyond
199S, mixed media
(130 cm x 90 cm)
by Elyette Lebas
Elyette Lebas is a French
artist who has been
influenced by North African
and Asian cultures. The
imaginary lettering she
introduces into her
paintings is meant to evoke
Oriental calligraphy which,
she writes, is "inspired by
nature and attains the
universal, linking
humankind with the
transcendent.
