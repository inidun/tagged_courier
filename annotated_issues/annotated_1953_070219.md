FROM THE UNESCO NEWS ROOM...
* India.-A trade union college for
Asian workers was opened at the end
of last year at Calcutta by the Inter-
national Federation of Free Trade
- Unions. Its purpose is to"help in
building up the Asian trade union
movement on sound, democratic lines".
The college is now in full operation
after overcoming initial language dif-
ficulties arising out of the different
linguistic backgrounds of its students,
who come from Hong Kong, India,
Japan, Malaya, Pakistan and Thailand.
English has been adopted as the col-
lege language.
* Canada.-The Canadian wood-
pulp and newsprint industry created
new production records in 1951, accord-
ing to the annual report of the Can-
adian Federal Bureau of Statistics
recently issued. For the first time, the
grcss value of the woodpulp produced
exceeded 1, 000 million Canadian dol-
lars-a 30 per cent increase over
1950 production. The record newsprint
production figure was 5, 561, 000 tons as
compared with 5, 319, 000 in 1950.
* International.-An annual film
award created by American producer
David Selznik for the European films
which most effectively contribute to
international understanding was pre-
sented recently in Paris. First prize
went to the British film"Cry, the
beloved country". Other prizes were
awarded to"The Heart of the World"
from Germany, to the Italian film
"Two cents worth of hope","The
Swindlers'Banquet"from Belgium,
and to"We are all murderers", made
in France.
* Unesco.-The Czechoslovak Gov-
ernment has instructed its Ambas-
sador in Paris to inform Unesco that
Czechoslovakia no longer considers
itself a member of this Organization.
* Austria.-The first Children's
Village to be organized in this country
has just been inaugurated at Imst, in
the Tyrol region. Its first eight houses
already have been opened to seventy-
five children. The Village was founded
following the initiative of a young Aus-
trian medical student who launched a
special fund-raising committee.
* International.-The United Na-
tions International Children's Emer-
gency Fund aided more than seventeen
million children in seventy two coun-
tries and territories this past year,
according to an announcement from
UNICEF officials. New stress was
placed on child health and welfare
services in rural areas, and help was
extended, for the first time, to a broad
section of Africa. UNICEF also
announced that voluntary contribu-
tions received in 1952 totaled nearly
ten million dollars. The money came
from governments and individuals in
twenty-eight countries.
* Sweden.-A Swedish film company
has produced a documentary film
called"The Road to Books". The
film tells the story of a little boy who
finds the page of a book on the
roadside, then visits the local public
library in search of the book itself. The
next scenes are a graphic explanation
of the role of the public library in the
service of the community. Unesco has
distributed copies in English, French
or Spanish to National Commissions
in member states.
* TJnesco.-A new booklet entitled
"Race and Society"has just been
published by Unesco in its series on
"The Race Question in Modern
Science". Author of the study is
Kenneth Little of Edinburgh Univers-
ity. Discussing the racial situation in
South Africa, Brazil, Hawaii and Great
Britain, the writer shows that history
rather than race is the main factor
in producing differences between the
cultures and cultural attainments of
the world's population."We can look
forward with some confidence", he
says,"to the day race and colour
distinctions will have ceased to plague
mankind".
* Peru.-Wall paintings have just
been uncovered near Lima, that date
back two thousand years. The frescoes
were found on the inner wall of an
ancient temple, and are in excellent
condition. Archaeologists say that they
show a greater range of colour and
finer workmanship than any others dis-
covered hitherto. They may reveal new
evidence of the interchange of cultures
that took place in South America
twenty centuries ago. The temple was
discovered accidentally by two Ameri-
can archaeologists while excavating in
the region.
* International.-A tuberculosis
"university"has been opened in Cairo
to serve students from the Arab
nations. It is being sponsored by the
Egyptian Ministry of Health in asso-
ciation with the World Health Orga-
nization. The new centre will train
students in modern methods of tuber-
culosis control, both preventive and
curative. Doctors, nurses social work-
ers and technicians from the area will
be welcomed.
* Austria.-The Austrian National
Commission for Unesco has awarded
prizes to a number of literary works
ccntributing to international under-
standing."The World's Little Inn"
by Siegfried Freiberg won the prize
for a play which has already been
published or performed. Friedrich
Kaufman, a hitherto unknown young
dramatist, received the award for all
unpublished play.
* International.-Delegates from
many Asian and western countries met
recently at Delhi, India, for the"Asian
Students Convention on the United
Nations". Purpose of this convention
was to interest Asian students in the
work of the United Nations and Spe-
cialized Agencies, and to discuss the
techniques of setting up and operating
a United Nations Students Association.
Unesco awarded four travel grants to
enable delegates from the US, Sweden,
Australia and Indonesia to attend.
* India.-The Government of India
has decided to establish a National
Academy, with headquarters at New-
Delhi, for the development of Indian
Letters. The Academy-to be named
"Sahitaya Academy"-will develop
co-cperation between the literary
associations, universities and cultural
organizations in India and abroad.
It will also arrange translations of
literary works between different Indian
languages and from foreign to Indian
languages and vice-versa.
BRITISH ARE
WORLD'S MOST
AVID READERS
Latest available statistics covering
such subjects as newsprint consump-
tion, illiteracy, school attendance
throughout the world have been pub-
blished by Unesco in"Basic Facts and
Figures", a compact, easy-to-read
handbook f priced ot % 0. 50 ; 3/- ;
150 fr.). In less than sixty pages,
the publication covers national statis-
tics on adults amble to read and write,
primary education, higher education,
libraries, museums, book production,
daily newspaper circulation, film pro-
duction, cinema attendance and radio
Broadcasting.
According to"Basic Facts and Figu-
res", Finland is the most literate nation
in the world, with only one per cent
of its population unable to read and
write. However, in Africa, illiteracy
rates going up as high as 99 % are
listed.
The island of St. Helena has the
world's highest rate of primary school
enrolment with 200 children out of
every 1, 000 population in class.
Enrolment in higher education is
highest in North America, with the
U. S. S. R. second and the rest of Europe
third. The United Kingdom leads
the world with 23, 759 public libraries.
It is also the world's most prolific pro-
ducer of new books, issuing 17. 072 new
titles in 1950 as compared to 11, 022
in the United States and 9, 993 in
France. Britons also read the most
newspapers. The British press sells
598 newspapers for every 1, 000 popula-
tion. Circulation per 1, 000 people
is next highest in Luxembourg, follow-
ed by Australia, Sweden, Denmark and
Norway. However, Americans get the
most to read, consuming an average
of 79 Ibs of newsprint per capita an-
nually, with only Canada, where the
rate is 50 ribs. approaching them.
The world's leading film producers
are in this order, the U. S., India, Ja-
pan, the U. K. and France. The U. S.
also leads in number of radio sets
per 1, 000 inhabitants-594. Ber-
muda, with 417 is second and Sweden,
with 307 is third. In 1949, there
were 57 sets per 1. 000 inhabitants in
the U. S. S. R.
In all, North American owns 52 %
of the world's radio sets. Europe has
29 % ; the U. S. S. R. 7 % ; Asia, 6 % ;
South America 3% ; Oceania 2 % ;
and Africa 1 %.
* Unesco.-A new volume of"Study
Abroad", Unesco's annual handbook
on scholarships has just been publish-
ed. Covering both 1952 and 1953, it
lists and explains nearly nineteen
hundred fellowship programmes and
some forty-three thousand opportuni-
ties for foreign study. Volume one of
the series, published in 1948, listed
only fifteen thousand such opportuni-
ties. The increase in part reflects the
real growth in internationai fellow-
ship programmes in the last five years.
* U. S. A.-Architectural students
from all parts of the world will be
given on-the-job training in American
architectural offices under a pro-
gramme announced by Mr. Ralph Park-
er, of the American Institute of
Architects, an affiliate of the Inter-
national Union of Architects which
has consultative status with Unesco.
The announcement was greeted in Par-
is by M. Pierre Vago, Secretary-Gene-
ral of the International Union, as"an
effort of major importance in providing
technical assistance to the coun-
tries concerned". The names and
addresses of nearly a hundred archi-
tectural offices which are ready to
place foreign architectural graduates
on their staff have already been mailed
to architectural societies in 35
countries, so that they may notify ar-
chitectural students of their opportun-
ity. The directory also lists an equal
number of offices which are ready to
sponsor and advise foreign students
planning to study and travel in the
United States. The architects'pro-
gramme will provide advanced pro-
fessional training by allowing foreign
students to serve practical interneships
in leading architectural offices. It was
announced that 40 architectural
offices in the United States are already
training foreign graduate students.
* Mexico : To help supply the huge
number of teachers needed for the
thousands of newly built rural schools,
Mexico's Secretary of Public Education,
Dr. Manuel Gual Vidal, is using a
unique and rapid educational system
whereby prospective teachers can earn
as they learn. During the day, they
are"junior", or not fully qualified
teachers, in local village schools ;
evenings are devoted to study for their
own career. Each year of this home
study increases their salary by one-
sixth. Thus, after completing their
six-year home-training course, the
"juniors"are entitled to the Diploma
of a Primary School Teacher, with the
standard salary this post carries. These
"juniors"can carry on their double
duties of teaching and studying, be-
cause they follow the special Corres-
pondence Courses given by the
Instituto de Capacitacion del Ma-
gisterio, or Teachers'Training School.
Under the guidance of the Secretary
of Public Education, these courses give
exactly the same curriculum as the
National Normal School in Mexico
City. The correspondence courses are
entirely free. The 1952 graduates from
the Instituto were the first to complete
its six-year term and provided Mexico
with 4, 000 new school-teachers. Rec-
ently, when its second term com-
menced, over 1, 400 juniors enrolled
during the first week.
* Unesco.-An American expert is
being sent by Unesco to Nigeria to try
to solve one of the most perplexing
problems facing educators-how to
teach the ABC's to people who have
no alphabets. He is Dr. Hans Wolff,
and his mission was especially request-
ed by the Nigerian government. Dr.
Wolff will live in a station-wagon for
a year, moving around the country
and recording some of Nigeria's fifty
different languages on a tape-recorder.
He will seek the words and accents
held in common. One thing he plans
to do, for instance, is to record a story-
teller in one village, and then to play
back the tape in neighbouring villages
to see how much is understood.
Eventually, he hopes to have a pho-
netic basis for a written alphabet to
serve all the Nigerian languages now
without one.
* Afghanistan : In Afghanistan,
where Unesco sent an educational
mission at the request of the Go-
vernment in 1949, a fundamental
education programme is in progress.
The Government has set up an
educational film library, opened 60 rural
schools, established a new institute for
training secondary school teachers, and
has begun courses for teacher training
and home economics for women. An
Agricultural College has been re-
organized, and an Engineering College
enlarged ; and in all, an entirely new
aspect to the educational picture in
Afghanistan has resulted.
* Burma : Since Unesco sent an
educational mission to Burma in 1951,
the Government has more than doubl-
ed its budget on education, is
planning to open a thousand new
primary schools, 200 junior secondary
schools, 40 senior secondary schools,
and a new teacher training college.
* A u s t ria.-A comprehensive
exhibition devoted to every aspect of
the work and objectives of Unesco has
just opened in Vienna, under the
auspices of the Austrian National
Commission for Unesco. The principal
themes of the exhibition are devoted
to the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights and to education in the service
of peace. Virtually, every aspect of
educational, scientific and cultural life
has been presented dramatically
through pictures, music, films and
lectures. The exhibition is the first
of its kind to be organized by the Aus-
trian Commission.
* Unesoo.-Unesco has sent its
sixty-eight Member States a series of
eleven recommendations on various
measures they might take to promote
the free flow of information. One
recommendation proposes that Mem-
ber States adhere to the two Unesco-
sponsored international agreements
abolishing import duties on education-
al scientific and cultural materials.
Another asks for support for Unesco's
efforts to facilitate travel abroad for
students, teachers and scientists. A
third recommendation asks that Mem-
ber States adhere to the Unesco-spon-
Gored Universal Copyright Convention ;
while another of the eleven suggestions
asks for reduced mailing rates for
books, newspapers and educational
materials. The recommendations fol-
Icw a previous series circulated in
1950. At that time, many States ans-
wered by liberalizing their tariff laws
and reducing postal rates on printed
matter.

SC<OURIER APRIL 1953. Page 3
A dike in the making. From an artificial island (top
photo) ribbonlike form of dike begins to wind its way
across what was once Zuider lee. When tugs and
workers have completed their task and pumped out
water, the dike will protect a new polder, and the Nether-
lands will have won more productive land from the sea.
by Michel SALMON
W RILE the full force of last February's devastating storm was. stillsweeping over the southern provinces of the Netherlands, a Dutch
official declared :"Not one inch of flooded land will be abandoned"
From the Governor of the stricken province of Zeeland also came words
with a courageous ring :"New land will be conquered."
Thus, in the midst of a catastrophe in which 430, 000 acres of land were
inundated, the Netherlands were not only preparing to throw back the
invading waters, but also to undertake new conquests against the sea.
Anyone not acquainted with the tenacious and enterprising character
of the Dutch people might well judge them rash to offer once again the
age-old and impudent challenge to their eternal enemy : Deus mare,
Batavus litora tecit-"God made the sea, the Dutch made the coastline."
Since the recent noods, the distinctive, deeply indented shape of
Holland's coastline has become more familiar to most people. But the
extent of the disaster has surprised those who do not realize the
vulnerability of this country, some parts of which are situated more than
20 feet below sea level.
If Holland's entire system of dikes, which total some 2, 000 miles in
length, had been breached, instead of only those in Zeeland, nearly half
the country including the rich provinces in the West would have disap-
peared under several feet of water. Amsterdam, The Hague and Rotter-
dam, the most densely populated centres, would have resembled the
legendary cities of Ys. Only the countryside of Drenthe and Gelderland,
and the poor lands of Overijssel and Brabant would have been spared.
this will be just an unpleasant memory III'tWo years or Sic
Go and see our polders-those around the Zuider Zee
that the sea was unable to conquer.
And so, at the invitation of the"Waterstaat en Verkeer",
(Continued
on following
pages.)
Today, the traveller who crosses Holland, by-passing the"zone of opera-
tions"in the south-west, cannot help being struck by the spirit of calm
determination he encounters everywhere. The Dutch people go about their
normal activities with perhaps even more energy than usual, but neither
feverishly nor with an air of despair.
As an engineer at Dordrecht calmly remarked to me :"After all, we
shall have less work this time than we did after the war, when we had
to drain about 570, 000 acres of land."
Later, at The Hague, another Netherlander told me :"We are filled
with gratitude by the immense example of international co-operation
which has been shown by countries all over the world. But we should
like our friends in other countries to know that we shall recover from
this tragedy by our own work, that Dutch agriculture will, except in the
devastated areas, meet its commitments, that our factories will continue
to turn out their products, that our workshops, shipyards and ports will
continue their activities. The inundations have not reduced our export
capacity. One of the most effective forms of help the world can give
us is to realize this fact and act upon it."
It was also in The Hague that I was given the following advice :"Don't
go away with the picture of the Zeeland devastation in your mind. All..-------------..............................-.......-... 1

ZUIDER ZEE
protective dike which was now losing :
its effectiveness anyway. This prev-.
ented any more of the materials being
lost in the gulf.
All the ships, floating cranes and
tugs in the area were warned to
stand by to assist in the work at the
danger spot. After hours of super-
human effort the battle was won.
All the gaps were sealed. The last
opening was finally closed on May 28.
1932, at 1 p. m., as the ships gathered
around sounded a salute on their
sirens. The radio announced the
news to a waiting nation, and as the
victory was celebrated in every town
and village, joyous peals of thanks-
giving rang across the flat country-
side from all the church towers and
belfrys. And at the place where the
great dike was finally closed a simple
monument was placed, bearing the
inscription"Een Volk dat leefs, bouwt
zign toekomst" (A people that lives,
builds its future).
Thus confined, the Zuider Zee
became a fresh water lake, safe from
the tides, and was renamed the
Ijsselmeer. Divided up by smaller
dikes and pumped dry through
gigantic sluices emptying into the
North Sea, the former Zuider Zee
will, in a few decades, give the
Netherlands its largest province,
increasing the country's total area by
some 12 per cent. So far, 168, 034
The greatest dike in the world, some twenty miles long stretching from North Holland to Friesland, separates the Zuider
Zee from the North Sea. It is planned to lay a double line railway track beside the present motor road and cyclists'path.
(Continued from the Netherlands
. previous po ge) Ministry responsib-
le for the drain-
age of the polders and for river
traffic, I went north to see the newest
of these polders.
Race with the sea
ABOVE my head, I saw a ship glidemajestically past me. I spied
several light-houses left high
and dry among the fields ; islands,
with meaningless jetties, surrounded
by a completely flat landscape which
reminded me of the sea itself. This
was the polder-a land wrested from
the sea and the rivers, and proudest
of all the empires won by the bold
and enterprising Dutch.
It brought to my mind the vivid
description of the Czech writer, Karel
Capek :"Imagine a stretch of sea built
round with dikes and then pumped
dry, leaving behind a great beach of
fine sand and a bottom rich with the
deposits carried down by the rivers
through the centuries. The Dutch
drain this fertile soil and plant grass ;
they set their cows to pasture and
make the cheeses which are sold at
Gouda and Alkmaar..."
The story of the transformation of
the Zuider Zee, once an enormous
stretch of sea 1, 351, 400 square miles
in area, concerns one of the finest
achievements of our century. It began
when C. Lely, an engineer whose name
is as honoured in the Netherlands
today as are those of Rembrandt,
Vondel and Spinoza, conceived the
idea of creating a dike which was
to span the twenty mile gap separat-
ing North Holland from Friesland.
At the start of the 20th century the
vast bay of the Zuider Zee separated
the provinces of Friesland and Overijs-
sel from Noord Holland. However,
after serious floods in 1916, the Dutch
Parliament approved a project for the
partial draining of this immense sheet
of water.
On May 1, 1919, the work began and
by 1923, engineers had started to close
up the narrow stretch of sea between
the coast of northern Holland and the
island of Wieringen. Two years later,
Wieringen was joined with the main-
land and the area of reclaimed land
became the first of the Zuider Zee
polders, the"Wieringermeerpolder".
Work on the main dike now began
to the east of Wieringen, between this
former island and the Friesian coast
20 miles away, with the construction
of an artificial island on which two
ports with equipment and workshops
were installed. These artificial ports
provided shelter for floating equip-
ment, such as giant cranes, and for
dumps of construction materials.
The foundations of the main
causeway, which was formed of two
separate dikes of clay and stones bet-
ween which many tons of sand were
poured, were laid in several different
points at once. But almost immediate-
ly, engineers ran into difficulties
because of variations in the depth of
the sea bed. Channels, some of which
were extremely deep, cut across the
path planned for the dike, and it was
foreseen that the sea currents in the
Zuider Zee, amplified by the effects
of the construction work, would scour
more and more sand from the beds
of these channels, making them still
deeper.
To counteract this, the engineers
began to close the channels with
underwater protective dikes, thus
forcing the currents to rise off the
sea bed and now over the top of these
protective works. But, as the main
dike grew longer and the still open
sections more narrow, the currents
raced through these gaps more
fiercely at each tide. Finally their
force was sufficient to sweep away
all the material which was being
dumped in to fill the remaining
openings.
Then began a dramatic race bet-
ween man and sea. For a moment
it seemed that the sea would win the
contest. So fast were the currents
that they had formed a chasm nearly
90 feet deep in front of the protective

If this had happened the men work-

A quick decision was needed as the
protective dike might have been swept
away at any moment and, moreover,
a storm already sweeping southern
Holland was reported to be coming up
the coast. The engineers decided to
start work immediately at a point
some 30 feet to the rear of the

acres have been drained, out of
538. 696 acres which are to be estab-
lished. These are the"Wieringer-
meerpolder"whose dikes were wan-
tonly destroyed by the Nazis in
April 1945, a fortnight before they
capitulated, and the North-East
Polder.
Dutch"far west"
A T Kampen, a picturesque Hans-eatic town, I left the"oude
land", or old country, and soon
reached the North East Polder. The
typical chessboard landscape, with its
roads intersecting at right angles and
its scattered houses unrolled slowly
before me.
The Dutch sometimes speak of the
Polders as their"Far West"and, in
fact, this polder is a sort of Far West
- prefabricated and surveyed in
detail even before it emerged from
the waters. Like the"new"lands of
America in the 19th century, the
fertile soil of the polders will soon
provide land for settlers from other
parts of this small country-the most
densely populated in Europe (more
than 770 people to the square mile).
Even the inn where I lunched, the
"Het wapen van Ens"brought to
mind the saloons one used to read
about in one's youth. And though
the"polderjongens"-the young
men working here and leading an
almost monastic communal life-do
not wear a cowboy's picturesque garb
or go chasing outlaws over the prairie
on horseback, they are engaged in
one of the most thrilling adventures
of modern times here on the northern
borders of the Netherlands.
At the tiny village of Markness I
was welcomed by the"Staat-boer",
one of the government farmers.
Here, everything was clean and
orderly-an enormous farm kept
scrupulously clean and equipped with
a radio and telephone ; rooms that
were bright with hot-house flowers.
All the outbuildings were equipped
with air conditioning and in the fire-
proof cow-houses, the plump Frisian
cows operated their own automatic
drinking water suppliers. Great sums
of money have been invested in the
polders and to supervise their devel-
opment an elaborate administrative
and social structure has been created,
in which the"staat-boer"has a
leading place.
When a polder is drained and the
mud and peat of the sea bottom
revealed, the ground is quite unfit for
working and is so soft that it will not
bear a man or a machine. This is
where the Ministry of Works engineers
take things in hand.
They dig canals-the first lines
of communication
in the polder-
thousands of miles
of drainage tren-
ches and ditches,
and lay countless
pipe-lines to carry
off the water from
deep down in the
soil and remove the
salt. As soon as the
earth its dry and
firm, it is analysed
by other specialists.
They then prepare
a detailed geologi-
cal map so as to
determine w h i c h
crops shall be allo-
cated to different
sections, while the less fertile areas
are marked out as sites for towns
and villages and for the planting of
woodlands.
The"Waterstaat"builds farm-
houses, makes motor roads (there are
310 miles of roads in the North-East
polder), plants various species of trees
and puts up public buildings. All this
is done with the technical advice of
an expert known as a"landscape
architect". Only when everything is
ready and the earth has produced one
or two satisfactory crops, thanks to

But there remain other things to
do before the farmers take over the
land."'Land hunger"in the Nether-

too small to satisfy everyone's needs.

This map of the Zuider Zee (or the Ijsselmeer, as it is now called)
and the cross-section of the area bounded by the letters A-B-C, shown

pumped dry after war damage in
1945. Work on the North East
Polder was delayed by the war,
and it was only completed in re-
cent months. work on the East
Polder is now being carried out,
while the two remaining polders
in the south and the west are in
the planning stage. The rest of
the Ijsselmeer is separated from
the North Sea by the great dike
completed in 1932.
At the point"A"of the cross
section are shown the natural sand
dunes of the West coast of
Holland. Their height can be
measured by the fact that even the
highest of the tides (the storm
flood level) is well below their
summits. But the area lying
behind them is well below sea
level. Further east, the'Vier..
ingermeer Polder (protected by the
dike shown at B") is actually
13 feet below sea level. Between
the cross section B-G"is the
Ijsselmeer, now a fresh water lake.
It was a combination of storm
and exceptionally high tides which
brought about the disastrous
flooding of Zeeland (not shown in
this map) on February 1. In
exactly the same way, it was
a mutual fury of winds and tides
which crumbled the dikes protect*
ing the fertile region to the south
of Dordreeht on the night of Nov-

acres of fertile land were covered,
72 towns and villages disappeared
under the waters and 100, 000
people lost their lives in this trag-
edy, which was known as the

ter and the recent inundations are

lands in their dealings with the
State.
Agricultural statistics show that
the North-East Polder, whose recla-
mation was not completed until
1949, gave the following yields (in
kilogrammes per hectare) in 1951 :
Winter wheat : 4, 280 ; summer
wheat : 3, 990 ; oats : 5. 060 ; flax :
5, 380 ; potatoes : 31, 590 ; sugar beet :
47, 310.
When the whole polder is under
cultivation and fully populated
(about 1956, according to the official
estimates) it will support
some 40, 000 inhabitants
and will produce over
60, 000, 000 florins (about
L 6, 000, 000), w 0 r tho f
various agricultural
products each year.
But agriculture is not
the only aspect of future
development which in-
terests the people of the
North East Polder. The
Tour ist Development
Board at Emmeloord,
c. hief town of the area,
has published a 150-page
booklet which is particu-
Jarly striking because of
its references to forests
and towns that are today
no more than building
sites and new planta-
tions. One illustration
shows fine avenues lined
with impressive buildings
and tall trees. This is
Emmeloord as it should
be in 1960.
In point of fact
Emmeloord is at present
a sort of"mushroom"
town, but one whose
growth is controlled.
Along its wide streets
three storey buildings stand side by
side with huts and tents. One
unpaved avenue lined with wooden
buildingsthe temporary homes of
leading banks-calls to mind a
Klondyke settlement during the
"Gold Rush". But the permanent
parts of the town-the three enor-
mous churches (1), Catholic, Lu-
theran and Calvinist, the neat shops
where cigar merchants preside over
their fragrant merchandise, the
well-kept schools and the boldly
designed houses-are typically
Dutch.
The tourists who already visit the
North East Polder learn something
of the past history of this area from
a museum on the former island of
Schokland where relics found at
the bottom of the Zuider Zee-
mammoth tusks, pottery, flint
implements, fragments of caravels
and old Spanish weapons corroded
by salt water-are exhibited.
There is something awe-inspiring
in the contrast between this"ants
nest"activity around the Zuider Zee
and the dreadful desolation in the
province of Zeeland. But then, the
Dutch have always found strength
to face up to the blows of fate with
a serenity which has nothing of
indifference to fate or of dumb
despair about it.
The progress and technical devel-
opment which have made possible
the"miracle"of the Zuider Zee
should also prevent any repetition
of the Zeeland disaster. The Dutch,
who dwell like sentinels on a
frontier of Europe, are convinced
that they will.

### 70227: Sirs el-Layan: Regional Education Centre for the Arab States

COURIER APRIL 1953. Page 7
REGIONAL EDUCATION C E N T R EF 0 R THE ARAB 5. T ATE 5 :
S) RS EL-LAYAN
IN a small village in the Nile Valley, the olderfolks were noticing with sadness that too
many young people left the land to seek a
better, more promising life in the big cities. The
older people were sad but they didn't know what
to do about it.
Then, one day, a government worker paid a
visit to the village. He told the people about a
government plan for building what he called a
"ural Social Centre"in their community. The
programme, he said, could help them to improve
their health, harvest better crops and earn more
money, and learn to read and write.
The villagers were willing to do their part, and
so the government sent two young social workers
to help them get started. One, a young man, was
a farming expert. The other was a young woman
nurse. With their assistance, the new social
centre was constructed. And it was a fine one.
It included a clinic, a maternity ward, a library.
There was also a recreation room, public baths
and laundries. The centre had classrooms, and
rooms for demonstrating better farming methods,
model beehives and so on.
When all was ready, the villagers set up five
committees.
A health committee was made responsible for
getting the village clean water, and for general
sanitation and hygiene. It worked with the
government nurse to make the new centre's clinic
a success.
A second committee tackled problems of
education and recreation. As its first task, it
established a school for the village children.
Then it organized evening classes for the adults.
It supplied the centre's library with books,
purchased a radio, and was soon bringing films to
the centre.
A changed village
A THIRD group worked with the young agri-cultural expert and with the village co-
operative society. Their goal was to raise
the economic level of the community. Using the
centre's classrooms, they demonstrated new far-
ming techniques. They bought and distributed
better seeds and improved breeding stock. They
also encouraged the peasants-or fellahin, as they
are called in Egypt-to make profitable use of
their spare time. They taught them how to raise
bees, for example, and silk-worms-how to im-
prove their spinning and weaving.
Two other committees rounded out the new
organization. One was a conciliation committee
to settle local disputes. The other was re-
sponsible for charity, and for helping widows,
orphans, the sick and the aged.
The results of this new programme of funda-
mental education came quickly enough. Young-
sters who had previously basked listlessly in the
sun, with flies on their faces and sores on their
eyes, were now more vigorous. The death-rate
among children dropped by almost two-thirds.
Families began to double their incomes. The
new school was filled in the day time by the
children, and at night by the adults. Before long,
the library became a favourite recreation spot
The case of this village centre is not an isolated
one. Since 1946, the Fellahin Department of the
Egyptian Ministry of Social Affairs ha. s helped to
establish 135 such centres.
Today, one of these villages has suddenly taken
on special international importance. It is Sirs
el-Layan, located about 50 miles north of Cairo,
which has been chosen as the headquarters for
Unesco's second regional fundamental education
centre to serve the Arab world in raising standards
of living through education. The first, serving
Latin America, has been in operation at
Patzcuaro, Mexico, since May 1951, and is now
accommodating more than 100 students from 16
countries.
Sirs el-Layan is situated between two branches
of the Nile, the Damietta and the Rosetta, in the
centre of the Menouf district, one of Egypt's most
fertile regions, with about 300, 000 inhabitants.
Within this district there are now 18 social
centres, 18 new type rural schools and six health
units. Sirs el-Layan itself is about 3 miles from
the town of Menouf, the administrative centre of
the district. In 1946 it was selected as the site of
a community development project of the Egyptian
Government. The plan was to develop Sirs el-
Layan as a model experimental area in which a
combined attack on ignorance, poverty and
disease was to be conducted by the Ministries of
Education, Social Affairs, Health and Agriculture,
with the Ministry of Trade and Industries co-
operating in the development of local industries.
Now it will serve as a model experimental and
training centre for all the countries of the Arab
world.
The Unesco centre was officially opened on
20 January 1953 by the Egyptian Premier, General
Mohamed Neguib and Dr. John W. Taylor, acting
Director-General of Unesco, at a ceremony
attended by Egyptian officials, representatives of
the Arab states and Specialized Agencies of the
U. N.
Fifty trainees from six Arab States (Egypt,
Hashemite Jordan, Iraq, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia,
Syria ; in addition, a number of Palestinian Arabs
have also been admitted) now make up the
centre's first class, but enrolment is expected
. to rise to 150 by September when new dormitory
facilities are to be completed, and to 200 by 1954.
These"students"are not undergraduates. They
were chosen because of their knowledge of the
rural problems of their country, their long
experience in rural education generally, and
their specialist knowledge in at least one field
of fundamental education. They include school
directors, village welfare workers, nurses, literacy
teachers, agriculturists and economists.
At Sirs el-Layan they will be trained to become
the leaders and.'the teachers of teachers"in
fundamental education work in their own
countries. Operating as teams in the various
villages which constitute the Menouf district, they
will be trained in the down-to-earth, practical
techniques of raising social and economic
conditions through education.

filmstrips for adult use are sorely needed
throughout the Arab world ; most existing edu-
cational materials in Arabic have been made
primarily for children. The centre and its
international team of students will develop model
materials designed particularly for adults and
specially adapted to meet the needs and resource
of local communities.
Although each student will specialize in a single
branch of fundamental education such as health,
hygiene, literacy or agriculture, each will be
trained to be something of an'''all-rounder''in
the team and to see fundamental education work
nob as a series of isolated tasks but as an
interdependent whole, each part of which is
equally essential for raising living standards.
Teams of leaders-
ON completing their training, the students
will return to their own countries as teams,
prepared to help in carrying out the edu-
cation programmes which the Arab r'. untries are
now launching on an increasing scale. Some of
these activities are already associated with
Unesco's normal programme, some have been
undertaken through U. N. technical assistance,
others have been started independently by
! national or international organizations. The
Unesco centre will co-operate with all, exchang-
ing information, carrying out research and
Bending expert help where it is needed.
The Sirs el-Layan Fundamental Education
Centre has been recognized as an institution of
decisive significance to the educational and social
welfare programmes of the Arab States.
The leaders in fundamental education trained
at the Unesco centre will help to provide these
masses with the health education they need to
combat endemic diseases and improve sanitation
and hygiene. They will be available to teach
better farming methods, soil conservation and
home economies ; to help foster the development
of rural crafts and small industries in order to
create new sources of income and livelihood for
village communities.
The establishment of the Unesco Fundamental
Education Centre has already created keen
interest everywhere in the region in fundamental
education as one practical answer to the cent-
uries-old problem of the Arab peoples. It has
also stimulated interest in the other aspects of
Unesco's work. Thus the centre is not only
helping to provide ways of improving living
conditions in the Arab world but is also helping
to foster international co-operation between the
peoples of a vital area of our modern world.

THE MIDDLE EAST IN THE
GRIP OF A SOCIAL UPHEAVAL

TILE VALLEYS OF LEBANON. (Unesco Photo).
FROM remotest antiquity, the Middle East (1) has servedas a highway linking together the three continents,
of Africa, Asia and Europe. It is the birthplace of
the world's earliest recorded civilizations, of monotheistic
religions, the art of writing, and many other major
cultural developments without which"Western"civiliza-
tion would be unthinkable.
A region with such an ancient and diversified historical
background naturally exhibits important variations among
its constituent parts. Yet, underlying these differences is
a basic unity which is also the product of a long historical
process. From earliest times, the river valleys of Egypt
and Mesopotamia radiated their civilizations to neigh-
bouring lands. Conquests, migrations and large-scale
deportation of populations diffused religious and cultural
patterns throughout the region. For over one thousand
years, the greater part of the Middle East was politically
unified, under the Persian, Macedonian and Roman
empires. During the first six centuries of the Christian
era, most of the region was subjected to the influence of
Christianity, which gave it a greater degree of cultural
unity than it had experienced before. In the course of
the following two centuries Christianity was replaced by
Islam, which constitutes today the main factor of cultural
unity.
Approximately 90 per cent of the population are
Moslems ; 4 per cent are Christians (divided among several
denominations) ; less than 2 per cent are Jews ; 2 per cent
(in the southern Sudan) belong to African tribal cults ;
most of the remainder belong to semi-Moslem sects. All
the political units in the region excepting three of the
smaller ones (Cyprus, Israel and Lebanon) have Moslem
majorities. Together with its religious beliefs and prac-
tices, Islam brought with it a legal code, the Sharia, which
until recently regulated almost all aspects of life of the
Moslem communities and many activities of non-Moslems.
It still exercises a deep influence on Middle Eastern
society..
Islam also helped to unify the Middle East by diffusing
the Arabic language, which for several centuries constitut-
ed the sole linguistic medium of science and literature,
and until very recently was likewise the official language
of religion and of the law throughout the region. More-
over, the three most widely spoken languages of the region
- Arabic, Persian and Turkish-have interpenetrated each
other to a marked degree and, as recently as fifty years
ago, a knowledge of two or three of these languages was
widespread among the educated classes.
Upon this relatively homogeneous Islamic society, the
impact of modern Western civilization has been, with local
variation, both marked and progressive since the end of
the 18th Century. The countries in which Western influ-
ence first made itself felt, and in which it penetrated most
deeply, bordered on the Mediterranean : Turkey, Egypt,
Palestine and Lebanon. The countries of the Arabian
peninsula on the other hand, have experienced the impact
of the West only during the last two or three decades.
This has introduced an important element of diversity
into the region which makes generalization extremely
difficult.
Moreover, Westernization has in no country affected all
classes equally. Even where it has penetrated deepest, its
influence tends to be much stronger in the urban areas
and in the upper and middle classes.
These classes (particularly the upper class) already
approximate the Western world in respect of birth and
death rates, life expectancy, housing, food and clothing,
medical services, education and other similar character-
istics. The great majority of the population, on the other
hand, and especially the three-quarters of the people who
live in rural areas, still largely continue to live according
to patterns that were developed in the Middle East many
centuries ago. It should be borne in mind, however, that
in practically all Middle Eastern countries there is a small,
but rapidly increasing and very influential, segment of
the population to which the statements made do not
generally apply.
Division of desert and sown
IT must also be noted that Israel differs widely fromthe region as a whole, not only because of traditional
religious-cultural differences between Moslems and
Jews, but also because of the effects of recent immigration,
particularly the immigration of European middle-class
professional families. An outstanding and highly
significant feature of other Middle Eastern countries is
their lack of a professional middle-class. The resulting
situation is that Israel has, for example, the largest
number of physicians for the size of its population of any
country in the world (one physician for every 380
inhabitants), while in other countries of the Middle East,
the gravest shortages of physicians are to be found (e. g.,
Iran has only one doctor for every 63, 000 inhabitants).
Geographically, the Middle East is characterized by a
dual division between Desert and Sown. Over 90 per cent
of the region is desert, or at best grazing steppe, with
great extremes of temperature, almost no rain at any
time of the year, and a very scanty vegetation of low
grasses and drought-resistant bushes. The narrow sown
tract is, generally speaking, Mediterranean in character,
having long, hot, rainless summers ; rainy, temperate
winters ; and a native vegetation ranging from grass to
open forests. The transition from the Desert to the Sown,
as a rule, is gradual, with the notable exceptions of the
two great river zones of the Nile and the Tigris-Euphrates
valleys, where it is abrupt and clearcut.

their physical environment, largely conform to this basic
regional dichotomy between Desert and Sown. The desert,
where the only feasible mode of existence has been that
of the wandering herder, has served for centuries as the
home of nomadic, animal-breeding tribes, the members
of which today constitute about 16 per cent of the total
population of the Middle East. The Sown, with its very
different physical conditions, has for at least as long been
the abode of the settled cultivators, who today make up
some 66 per cent of the peoples of the region. The
remaining 18 per cent live in towns, some of which can
boast an uninterrupted history of several thousands of
years.
Living conditions vary somewhat from one nomadic tribe
to another, and even more appreciably from one settled
area to another ; yet these differences (as between tribe
and tribe, village and village, town and town) seem
superficial indeed when juxtaposed to the profound dif-
ferences which separate the total living conditions of
each type of community from those of the others. These
dissimilarities are so pronounced that demographic, social,
economic, and cultural characteristics, which are expressed
statistically in national or regional averages, have little
meaning unless they are immediately followed by a break-
down of each figure according to the aforementioned
three major population types. At present, however,
statistical data from the Middle East as a whole are
sporadic, inadequate and unreliable, while figures relative
to any specific type of community in most cases simply
do not exist.
Poverty and endemic disease
souT 20 per cent of the region as a whole is composedof urban population (definitions of"urban"vary
'*'widely), about 65 per cent is composed of settled
rural population and about 15 per cent is composed of
nomadic or semi-nomadic peoples. The urban population
is estimated to be no more than 10 per cent in Afghanis-
tan, Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and the Arabian Peninsula,
but 40 per cent in Lebanon and 50 per cent in Israel. The
nomadic and semi-nomadic population ranges from 0 per
cent (Cyprus, Egypt, Lebanon) to 33 per cent in Afghanis-
tan and the Arabian Peninsula and 40 per cent in Jordan.
The Middle East is in general an area of high birth
rates ; death rates while still very high, have been partially
controlled, resulting in rates of population increase of
10 to 20 per thousand a year. High rates of increase are
drived in part from the virtual elimination of famines
and pestilential diseases, such as cholera and plague,
which until very recent times periodically decimated the
population ; and from decreases in infant and child
mortality, although rates are still very high in comparison
with those of more economically'developed countries.
Thus, in Egypt, for example, which has more facilities
for child care than most of the other Middle Eastern
countries, one child out of three dies before reaching his
fifth birthday.
Both general conditions and social attitudes appear to
favour the continuation of high birth rates for some time
to come. These conditions and attitudes include the over-
whelmingly agrarian structure of society, the isolation and
illiteracy found in wide parts of the region, the traditional
family pattern (the extended family), the widespread
desire for heirs, especially male heirs, and the absence of
economic incentives to limit the number of offspring.
At the present time, the Middle East is in the grip of a
social upheaval, the causes and ingredients of which are
varied and complex. Chief among the factors involved
are the long-standing problems of. poverty and endemic
disease, brought to focus by increasing contact with the
West and consequent awareness of its higher standard of
living ; the disintegration of the traditional family pattern
and the decline of patriarchal authority ; the growth of
national selfconsciousness and nationalist aspirations ;
the increasing pressure of population upon land in some
areas ; the expansion of cities and industries, attended by
a gradual reduction of the isolated hinterland ; and the
increasing demand for the social and political equality
of women.
The byword in many quarters is change, though there
is little unanimity on what change is desirable, or how
it is to be effected, or at what pace. In governmental
and professional circles, thinking about the problem of
social change has crystallized into two contrasting points
of view : the one envisages the destiny of the Middle East
as lying in the direction of a return to the pristine ideals,
values, and traditions of Islam, and seeks to effect changes
and reforms within that framework ; the other advocates
radical and sweeping innovations along Western lines, and
the scrapping in large part of indigenous traditions. Yet
a third view, however, takes a middle position, and
considers that the basic need is for an organic develop-
ment of Middle Eastern society in which desirable in-
novations borrowed from outside are integrated and
merged with strong and wholesome forces of traditional
culture. In many parts of Turkey, Egypt, Syria, and
Lebanon, economic and social change is already quite
far advanced ; yet in other parts of these same countries,
as elsewhere throughout the Middle East, such change
has been slight.
Beneath the surface of the ideological divisions, however,
there is a growing restlessness among the masses of the
people. At the same time, the significance of the masses
and the need for improving their lot are being increas-
ingly recognized by all classes. Leaders of government
have, to a greater or lesser extent, initiated or planned
reforms (e. g., social welfare programmes, political suffrage,
land reform, expansion and improvement of primary and
secondary education). Yet the technical skills and
facilities available for the implementation of these reforms
are not adequate to the need-hence the crucial import-
ance of programmes of technical assistance.

### 70229: The Village, pivot of Arab life

Page 10. APRIL 1953
THE VillAGE, PIVOT OF ARAB liFE
THE most typical way of lifethroughout the Middle East
is that of the agricultural vil-
lage."With few exceptions, (for
example, fishing villages on the
coasts of Arabia ; marsh villages in
southern Iraq), the settled villagers
are cultivators of the soil. For
thousands of years, the villages have
been the foundation stones vf Middle
Eastern life, barely supporting their
own inhabitants while providing the
food and luxuries consumed in big
cities.
The bulk of the agricultural popu-
lation lives in dire poverty and in
extremely unsanitary conditions.
Most of the villages are tightly
packed conglomerations of buildings
with no sewage system and with no
more adequate water supply than a
single spring or well, which is often
situated at some distance from the
village, and the water of which is
frequently polluted. The problem of
water shortage (which lies at the
basis of the nomadic way of life)
is a critical one for living standards
in Middle Eastern villages, not only
because it limits agricultural pro-
duction and is conducive to disease
- the wide prevalence of eye and
skin diseases is attributed in good
part to the lack of fresh water-but
also because it may involve a serious
cost affecting the peasant's real
income. In some areas, water rights
are owned separately from, or in
addition to, the land, and the
peasant share-cropper has been
traditionally obliged to give up to
one-fifth of his crops in return for
water supplied by the landlord.
The peasant family lives in a
single one-or two-room hose
built of the raw material available
in the district (stone, mud, reeds,
etc.). The need for heating facilities
is felt chiefly in the more northerly
latitudes and above a certain eleva-
tion ; but fuel supplies are scarce
and expensive. Manure, in the form
of kneaded and dried dung cakes,
is widely used as fuel for heating
and cooking, a practice which
deprives the soil of much-needed
natural fertiliser.
The typical Middle Eastern vil-
lage possesses some traditional
institutions which, at present, are
being brought increasingly under
the control, or at least the influence,
of the government. The village
guest-house (mad : 7 in Arab lands,
Kay Oodasi in Turkey, etc. J, found
in many but by no means all villages,
serves both as a place for the enter-
taining of guests and as a gathering-
place for the villagers themselves.
In Turkey, these guest-houses have
in many instances been either
replaced or supplemented by the
more recently established"people's
houses" (Halk Odalari). In the
larger Middle Eastern villages, there
are also usually a number of coffee-
shops, and, in some cases, a com-
munal bath.
Fami) y traditions
ANOTHER important traditionalviII age institution is the
mosque, or in Christian vil-
lages, the church. Most villages
possess one or more mosques, and,
in some cases, also a church. The
mosque is under the care of a
sheykh, or religious leader, who
usually exercises considerable in-
fluence over the beliefs and atti-
tudes of the villagers and who
teaches the children attending the
Koran-school housed in the mosque.
In many cases, the sheykh owns and
works land like any other peasant.
The forms of social organization
in the village depend on several
factors, of which the most important
are the size of the village and the
history of its inhabitants. Many of
the smaller villages are inhabited by
various families all of whose members
are related to one another and
regard themselves as the descen-
dants of one common ancestor who
first established the village. Larger
villages may contain two or more
such family-groups, between whom
there may be some rivalry.
The chief of one of these family
groups is, as a rule, the village head-
man, whose pre-eminent position,
traditionally based on his headship
of a leading family, is latterly under-
going a transformation as a result
of which he must now frequently be
elected by the villagers and con-
firmed by the government, or else be
appointed directly by the govern-
ment. The headman is usually
economically better off than the
average villager and has consid-
erable influence and prestige in the
village. Assisted by a council of
village elders, the headman does the
administrative work in the village,
has in many cases limited jurisdiction
to resolve small disputes, and is the
intermediary between the village
and the government. On the one
hand, he represents the interest of
the village vis-a-vis the head of the
district to which the village belongs ;
on the other hand, his duty is to
enforce government orders, to assist
the tax collector in his work, and
to exercise a general responsibility
for the village to the government.
The extended family, consisting of
an elderly male head and all his
male descendants and their wives,
plus unmarried females, is the norm
in the Middle East. It is most firmly
established in the villages and
among the nomads, although it
likewise survives, in a modified form,
in the cities. The extended family
is the basic unit of Middle Eastern
economy. In the village, it owns and
works the land jointly. (In the
nomadic tribe, it holds the flocks and
herds in common, and in the cities,
it often carries on in common a
traditional industry or a commercial
enterprise.)
The women marry early-usually
at the onset of sexual maturity or
even earlier ; the number of un-
married adults, male or female, is
very low. Polygamy is permitted in
Islam with certain restrictions ;
however, not more than 5 per cent
Turkish farmer and son : Turkey is one Middle East country which is expanding its rural school systems. To ensure that its
village training institutes produce rural teachers, it opens them only to the sons of peasants. By 1948-49 more than 12, 000
had graduated, and it is hoped that by 1956, some 37, 000 teachers will be ready to take jobs in the villages. (Photo Reahtes)
of the married men of the region
as a whole have more than one wife
at a time. Although veiling is not
practised in the villages, and women
have traditionally worked in the
fields alongside their men folk as
well as in their households, segreg-
ation of the sexes remains the rule.
As long as the family lives to-
gether and earns its livelihood
together, and as long as the property
of the family is held and controlled
by its head, paternal authority is
strong, and the career of the young
people is clearly cut out for them
along traditional lines. Each suc-
ceeding generation continues the
occupation handed down to it by its
predecessor : animal husbandry in
the nomadic tribe, cultivation in the
village, and a trade or artcraft
belonging to the"old industries"in
the towns.
Change of authority
IN traditional Middle Easternsociety the family is thus the
principal social structure within
which the individual must fit close-
ly and to the control of which he
must submit. When this control is
weakened by village-to-town migra-
tion, industrialization, employment
on an individual basis, growing
force of governmental control, etc.,
serious disturbances in social and
psychological equilibrium may ensue.
The replacement of family and
paternal authority by more imper-
sonal social forces (government,
public opinion), and at the same
time by more personal individualistic
forces ("self-determination","self-
reliance), is rarely a smooth
process, and is often fraught with
dangers of maladjustment.
The income of the Middle Eastern
villagers is determined essentially
by what they derive from the land,
plus minor supplements from live-
stock and from some handicrafts.
The actual levels of personal income
and consumption of the agricultural
village populations have never been
systematically measured, except for
a few surveys of doubtfully re-
presentative villages ; but they are
generally known to be extremely
low. National income estimates
assign per capita incomes of $100
or less to most countries of the area
(8389 in 1949 to Israel, however, and
H25 to Lebanon and Turkey), yet
these estimates do not take account
of the very wide differences in
income of different groups-differ-
ences, for example, between large
landowners and peasants, which
arise from the fact that a single
landowner may receive as much as
half the crops produced by a great
many peasants. Some observers
believe that rural living conditions
have not improved, and possibly
have become worse, during recent
decades.
One available study on the
Egyptian economy indicates that in
the twenty years up to 1940,"the
volume of agricultural production...
only just succeeded in keeping pace
with the population, in spite of much
technical research and improvement
in methods of cultivation". At the
same time, prices of export crops
declined, and there was a falling off
in the national consumption of such
staple articles as cereals, sugar,
coffee, tea, tobacco and textiles.
Studies by the Fellah Bureau in
Egypt have shown that, in 181 vil-
lages, rents had risen in 1944-45 by
242. 5 per cent in relation to 1938-39
rents, while income from the main
crops had risen 230 per cent. The
FAO estimates that, since World
War II, the region as a whole has
exceeded pre-war food production
by about 10 per cent, but that the
population has increased faster, and
per capita food production has
therefore decreased slightly.
Some of the causes of low per
capita productivity, low income and
low consumption in the Middle East
are common to the region as a
whole ; others are peculiar to certain
countries. Egypt, for example, is
particularly affected by the problem
of population pressure on the arable
land ; productivity per unit of land
there is high, but productivity per
person is low.
There is about ten times as much
arable land in the United States per
person as in Egypt, and nearly 40
tiines as much per person of the
UNESCO ;

Most of the villages of the Middle East are tightly packed conglomerations of buildings with no more adequate water supply than a single spring or well. There is
a deep cleavage between town and country. The town is widely regarded as the focus of everything desirable, while the village is the symbol of backwardness.
This partly explains the constant flow of migrants from village to town. This tendency was accelerated by conditions during The Second World War.
agricultural population. (This does
not take into account the permanent
meadows and pastures and other
lands potentially cultivable in the
United States, none of which exist
to any great extent in Egypt). The
intensive cultivation of the arable
soil in Egypt by many farm workers,
and the richness of this soil, produce
a higher yield per hectare than is
achieved through mechanized farm-
ing in the United States : never-
theless, the yield per unit of land in
Egypt, would have to be 40 times
greater in order to produce the same
income in terms of production per
person as in the United States.
Also, it may be anticipated that
Egypt's death rate, which is now
relatively high but declining, will be
significantly reduced in the near
future through public health mea-
sures, and that the already dense
agricultural population will become
even denser, since there is no evi-
dence that the birth rate will decline
correspondingly in the near future.
Quite clearly, then, Egypt's diffi-
culties cannot be resolved without a
major attack upon the problem of
land-and-population.
On the other hand, the Middle
East region as a whole is not land-
starved. There is, for example, a
fair amount of cultivable but, as yet,
unused land in Iran and Iraq ; yet
the rural poverty in these countries
is little different from that of Egypt.
According to FAO estimates, the
amount of unused land that can be
potentially brought under cultiva-
tion in the region as a whole is
twice the amount now cultivated.
In such countries as Turkey, Iraq,
Syria, and Saudi Arabia, very consid-
erable expansions of cultivated
areas have actually taken place in
recent years. But the rate of ex-
pansion has not in general kept up
with the rate of population growth.
Much of the land now under culti-
vation, moreover, has become se-
riously and progressively eroded
(partly because of the eating habits
of the many free-ranging goats in
the area), and conservation and irri-
gation are crucial needs.
land share problems
THE type of land tenure systemprevailing in large parts of the
Middle East has been widely
commented upon as a reason for
low productivity and low income of
the agricultural villager. Much of
the land is owned by a small
number of wealthy families who
commonly live in the towns (and
who do not usually run centrally-
organized estates but let out sepa-
rate pieces of land to tenants or
middlemen). A great many of the
villagers are tenant sharecroppers,
others own such small plots that
they must seek additional land on a
share-cropping basis or work part-
time for wages on large properties,
in order to maintain themselves at
even a subsistence level. By tradi-
tion and law, land is subdivided
amongst heirs, and this has meant
more and more families on minimal
plots and a growing body of landless
labourers.
The unequal distribution of land,
as well as the heterogeneous forms
of tenure found in the Middle East,
result from historical processes, some
going back to the Ottoman conquest
or earlier. Available statistics give
a very imperfect picture of the num-
bers of large landowners, smallhol-
ders and landless peasants, and the
relative importance of the holdings.
In Iran, about 50 per cent of the
claimed land reportedly belongs to
some 100, 000 large landowners ;
about 15 per cent is in small hold-
ings ; and 35 per cent is in State
domaine or religious endowments
(waqfs). Here, and in neighbouring
Iraq, which also has highly-concen-
trated land ownership, much of the
land is leased by the owners to mid-
dlemen, usually town dwellers, for
fixed rents, which the latter collect
along with their own profit from the
peasant who works the land.
In Syria, only 30 per cent of the
agricultural workers are reported to
be independent peasants. In Egypt,
while most peasants possess land,
only a minority can and do make a
living from their own land. In 1947,
11, 000 land owners with 50 feddans
(21 hectares) or more owned 36. 8 per
cent of the cultivated area of Egypt ;
143, 000 owners with 5-50 feddans
(2. 1-21 hectares) owned 29. 7 per
cent ; 587, 000 owners with 1-5 fed-
dans (. 42-2. 1 hectares) owned 20. 4
per cent ; and 1, 921, 000 owners vith 1
feddan and less owned 13. 1 per cent.
The last-mentioned group, 70 per
cent of the total number of land-
holders, hardly have enough land for
the maintenance of a family.
It is important, however, to note
that, as in the case of land shortage,
inequality of land ownership does
not fully explain low standards of
rural income throughout the Middle
East. Turkey, for example, has tra-
ditionally been a country of indepen-
dent farmers, without excessive
concentrations of ownership. Tur-
key, moreover, does not generally
suffer land shortage (and a govern-
ment Act was introduced in 1945 to
help the existing landless peasants
and those with undersized plots to
obtain land). There is also exten-
sive individual ownership or small-
holding in Lebanon, although many
large estates have arisen as a result
of the chronic indebtedness of the
peasants. Yet, rural incomes in
these countries-while probably
higher than the regional average-
are extremely low, and, of course,
are in no sense comparable to those
in an economically developed area
like England (where most of the
arable land is held under tenancy,
highly regulated by law).
The confusion of land titles ; the
prevalence of narrow, inefficient
"strip"holdings ; and the excessive
fragmentation of land into plots
consisting of as little as a fraction
of an acre in consequence of the in-
crease of farm population and of
inheritance laws which encourage
the subdivision of land, are among
the additional obstacles standing in
the way of agricultural development,
especially in Egypt, Jordan, Leba-
non, Palestine and Syria.
The poverty of the villages of the
Middle East is also due to a complex
of other factors-widespread dis-
ease, which cuts down productivity
at critical periods ; underemploy-
ment, which means that many heal-
thy villagers find nothing to do a
good part of the year ; rural indebt-
edness, which means that the pea-
sant cannot enjoy the surplus of
good crop years because of the finan-
cial pall cast by bad
crop years ; illiteracy, (cont'd on
ignorance of improved next page).

farming methods, and a complex of
mental attitudes which make im-
provements difficult to introduce
from without ; lack of communica-
tion among the peasants and lack
of organizational means for taking
common action to improve condi-
tions ; etc.
Agricultural duties call for a
concentration of effort at certain
times of the year, but at other times
there is a vast amount of poten-
tially productive manpower which is
idle in Middle Eastern villages.
Studies carried out in certain villages
on the Delta in Egypt, for example,
showed that the average peasant
worked no more than 180 days a
year. Similar underemployment has
been reported for other countries in
the region-Lebanon, Turkey, Iran,
Iraq and Syria. Pressure of popula-
tion upon the limited land available
aggravates the underemployment in
Egypt and Lebanon, but Turkey,
Iran, Iraq and Syria are not coun-
tries with a land shortage. In fact,
Syria requires foreign labourers
during harvesting.
Putting this idle manpower to
productive work is obviously one of
the basic requirements for raising
standards of living in the Middle
East. Among the solutions under-
taken or proposed are : diversifica-
tion and rotation of crops, the devel-
opment of handicrafts (Egypt has
used rural social centres for this
purpose), the organization of effec-
tive services for distributing man-
power among different occupations
at different times of year (as done
already in Israel), the use of spare
village manpower for village impro-
vement and development projects
under a nominal incentive payment
from the government ("Community
Development Employment", as un-
dertaken in Greece), and the ex-
pansion of industries.
Closely related to the problem of
the maldistribution of land is that
of rural indebtedness. The uncer-
tainty of the rainfall and the low
income of the farmer, whether pea-
sant proprietor or sharecropper,
combine to drive him into debt,
while the lack of well-organized
agricultural banks-and his lack of
collateral that may be required by
available banks-forces him to have
recourse to money lenders whose
rates are extremely high, especially
in years of crop failures when the
demand for loans rises sharply.
In recent years, a noticeable im-
provement has taken place in this
respect. In the first place, there has
been a marked increase in agri-
cultural credit facilities, mainly
through governmental efforts, which
has resulted in an appreciable
reduction in interest rates. Thus,
the institution in 1930 of the State-
sponsored Agricultural Credit Bank
of Egypt has resulted in a sharp de-
crease in the business of money
lenders. Secondly, the growth in
the co-operative movement in some
countries has provided an alterna-
tive source of credit.
In Cyprus, the services of the co-
operative societies cover virtually the
whole rural population.
In Egypt, the number of rural
credit corporations was increased
from 738 in 1939 to 1, 654 in 1948 and
the membership from 70, 021 to
527, 073. They furnish their mem-
bers such services as buying sup-
plies, marketing produce, carrying
out certain agricultural work and
securing loans. Their activities
also include the social welfare of
their members through fighting illi-
teracy, spreading co-operative edu-
cation, creating social clubs, foster-
ing preventive health education and
medical services, introducing rural
and home industries and organizing
local charity.
In Turkey, the number of rural
credit co-operatives rose from 601
in 1940 to 879 in 1948 and their
membership from 138, 412 to 411, 204 ;
about one-quarter of the total num-

TRADITION v. DESIRE FOR CHANGE
ber of villages are linked up with
the co-operative credit system.
Israel is unique in that a high
proportion of the rural population
live in settlements organized entire-
ly on co-operative lines ; about
45 per cent of the population are
covered by these and other types of
co-operatives.
In Iraq, Iran ; Lebanon and Syria
the co-operative movement has as
yet spread among rural areas only
to a limited extent, in spite of the
encouragement of governments. In
view of the fact that the peasant
who markets his products is fre-
quently exploited by the merchant,
the FAO considers that co-operative
marketing societies"could do
much... to secure a fair share of the
price to the farmer".
The majority of Middle Eastern
villages have no motorable road
connection with even the nearest
urban centres. Newspapers, radios
and telephones are rarities (though
radios are increasing).
Isolation is most extreme in the
mountainous hinterland of Afghan-
istan and Iran ; in the border
region of Iran, Iraq and Turkey ; in
southern Arabia ; and in the sou-
thern part of the Sudan.
Educational transition
LIKE nomadic culture, villaget culture has been predominantly
'-non-literate. There is, to be
sure, a rich traditional body of folk
stories, songs, and the like ; but
most villagers speak local dialects
differing more or less widely from
written Arabic, Persian, or Turkish,
and learning to read write has
meant in effect learning almost a
new language. Only very recently
have any efforts been made to take
these difficulties into account in
mass-communication media. For
example, the Egyptian State Broad-
casting Corporation started in
1940 and had expanded in recent
years a programme of broadcasts
offering subjects of special interest
to the rural population and employ-
ing Egyptian colloquial Arabic ra-
ther than the literary Arabic custo-"mary for its radio programmes.
Village schools, where they have
existed at all, have traditionally
been religious schools, in which, as
previously stated, the shevkh of the
village mosque taught some of the
village boys to read and memorize
the Koran, along with the rudi-
ments of writing and arithmetic.
Girls were rarely sent to school, and
the small percentage of village boys
who attended left after one or two
years of study. Up to a century
ago, these Koranic schools (kuttab
or maktabl were almost the only
schools in the Middle East, but their
number is diminishing with the
increase of facilities for secular
education. In many villages, how-
ever, they remain the only schools
available, and in some places there
is still an opposition to sending
children to secular schools, even
though in the secular schools in
most Middle Eastern countries
teaching of the Koran and other
religious subjects occupies a promi-
nent place in the curriculum.
Transitional phases are apparent.
In Afghanistan, for example, where
the development of a rural school
system has only just begun, the
most recent government plan states
that such schools shall be housed
in community mosques and taught
by the community religious leaders
until the government is able to
construct separate school buildings
and train teachers.
Rural school systems are gradual-
ly being expanded, but the goal of
a school in each of the thousands
of villages is still distant in most
countries. In 1945, some 12, 500 vil-
lages in Turkey (or 37 per cent of
the total number of villages) had
schools, as against 21, 500 (63 per
cent) villages without schools..
By 1948-49 more than 12. 000 teach-
ers had graduated from 24 village
institutes established for the pur-
pose of training teachers for the
rural areas. It is hoped that by
1956 approximately 37, 000 village
teachers will be ready to take jobs
in the villages, thus providing an
average of more than one addition-
al teacher to each village.
The need of village families to
utilize the labour even of young
children on the land, the financial
burden of building thousands of
schools and paying thousands of
teachers, and the difficulty of find-
ing and training teachers willing to
undergo the isolation and discom-
forts of village life, have prevented
most Middle Eastern countries from
making rapid progress in the field
of education.
Furthermore, in spite of the fact
that the towns are already better
off with regard to schooling than
the rural areas, some governments
continue to pay much greater atten-
tion to the increase of urban edu-
cational facilities rather than those
of the countryside.
Contradictory picture
A COMPLEX of mental attitudesassociated with the isolation
and illiteracy of the Middle
Eastern villagers, as well as with
their historical experiences, some-
times renders outside efforts at
improvement of living standards
difficult. A suspicious altitude
towards everything that comes from
outside, and especially from the
authority of the government, is
still widely reported. Until recently,
c h a n g e s of government usually
meant little to the villagers, their
only contract with government
having been payment of taxes.
Accustomed not to an"expanding
economy" (where new wealth may
add to the total wealth) but to a
static economy (where increases
in wealth of one person or group
are apt to be at the expense
of others), the villager has been
rather more concerned with hold-
ing on to what little he has pos-
sessed than with pursuing ideals of
progress and material improvement.
Furthermore, living not too far
above the bare survival level, with-
out capital reserves, he has been
loath to take risks that might prove
disastrous for himself and his
family. These adjustments to a
situation of poverty have served to
impede action against poverty.
The Middle Eastern village today
presents a contradictory picture of
adherence to tradition and anxious
desire for change. The villager
clings to the family, community,
and religious institutions which
have in the past contributed to his
security, and is mistrustful of out-
side forces which threaten to
weaken these institutions. At the
same time, he cannot ignore these
forces. In many cases, the increas-
ing pressure of population on village
landholdings prevents the villagers
from maintaining their accustomed
subsistence level and weakens the
ties of the extended family. Im-
provement of communications per-
mits a search for alternate
means of livelihood. Some villag-
ers drift away to the city in search
of wage-labour, and the idea that
change may be possible and desir-
able trickles back to the villages.
The villagers themselves are begin-
ning to demand land reform,
schools, health services and co-ope-
ratives, and the governments are
beginning to meet these demands.
The demands, of course, are fre-
quently vague ; the villagers know
that something must be done, but
are not sure what. And govern-
ment measures are, in many cases,
adopted without full planning, and
frequently changed with changes of
government.
Since the village population cons-
titutes two-thirds of the total pop-
ulation of the Middle East, the
problems of the village are also
the problems of the whole region.
It is obvious that, because of the
interdependence of the various
factors affecting rural welfare, a
comprehensive programme of
change is desirable-involving im-
provements in health and sanita-
tion, housing, education, communic-
ation, techniques of agricultural
production, credit, uses of manpow-
er, etc. An interesting experi-
ment in comprehensive rural deve-
lopment projects has been under-
taken in Egypt where a series of
"rural social centres"has been set
up, based upon the principles of :
1) co-ordination of comprehensive
services involving economic, social
and cultural elements ; 2) co-opera-
tion of the community in the cons-
truction of the centres ; and 3) sim-
plicity and low cost in capital and
recurrent expenditures. The endea-
vour is to promote change by
concentrating on local problems,
taking local attitudes into account
and encouraging local leadership.
The"People's Houses"in Turkey
have had similar goals of compre-
hensive social services.
At the same time, it is also appar-
ent that improvements in the wel-
fare of the village communities will
also depend greatly upon the
overall development of the country
at large, including, particularly, in-
dustrial development.
In an Arab refugee camp in the Middle East, this Palestinian farmer tends young tree seedlings in re-afforestation plantation. Trees will eventually be replanted
to check soil erosion, one of the major problems of Arab agriculture. This is partly due to eating habits of many free-ranging goats in this area of the world.

AUSTRALIA'S BUSH COUNTRY CHILDREN
'TALK BACK'TO THEIR TEACHER
By L. A. BINGHAM
ONE of the greatest problemsconfronting parents in the
lonely cattle land of the Aus-
tralian outback has always been the
question of how to educate their
children.
Of course the children themselves,
with pet horses, calves, and other
animal playmates, wouldn't think
that was anything to worry about.
It has always been the aim of the
Australian States to carry the bene-
fits of education into the more
remote and sparsely settled districts.
In that huge inland area-the Nor-
thern Territory alone has an area
nearly two and a half times the size
of France-the carrying out of such
a worthy aim is not an easy matter.
At first, itinerant teachers went to
the station homesteads and settler's
cottages to instruct the children on
the cattle holdings, or in the rail-
way camps along the single-track
straggling railway lines stretching
out into the inland. The tremendous
task these teachers undertook will
be readily understood when it is
remembered that in Queensland in
1927 nine itinerant teachers travelled
57, 727 miles to visit 1, 139 children
living in the inland sheep and cattle
country.
In the harsh lands of the Northern
Territory during that same year, one
teacher alone spent the whole year
travelling to and fro over enormous
distances to teach twelve children to
read and write. These wandering
teachers, their work well done, were
replaced by Government Correspon-
dence Schools set up to meet the
needs of children out of reach of the
ordinary means of education. These
followed naturally as a result of the
introduction by the Postal Depart-
ment of regular mail services, mostly
once a week, or once a fortnight in
the more isolated areas.
Strangely enough, the majority of
Australians, clustered as they are in
the over-crowded coastal cities,
know very little if anything about
these excellent primary Correspond-
ence Schools. To the outback
child, however, Miss Smith, or Miss
Jones, his teacher perhaps 2, 000 miles
away, whom he has never seen, is
someone to whom he can write short
letters about his pets and his life.
No child with schools close at
hand could possibly realize the
pleasure and excitement there is
among, the children on an inland
station on mail days. When the
mailman's lorry rattles to a stand-
still and the mailbag is thrown
down, there is a rush to see what
teacher has had to say.
Some places employ a governess to
supervise the correspondence work.
Where this is done the children go
to school on the side verandah or out
under the trees at the same hours
as school children in the cities. Des-
pite the fact that such positions are
of a high standing socially, and the
opportunities of marrying into well-
to-do grazing families are good,
governesses in inland Australia today
appear to be becoming fewer and
fewer. They were plentiful during
the depression years, but the return
to full employment has kept girls
closer to the bright lights of the
cities.
Teachers may well ask whether
the correspondence system is suc-
cessful, particularly where only the
parents are available to supervise
the children's work. It has, in fact,
more than lived up to the most
hopeful expectations of the State
educational authorities. Parents
themselves have been so pleased
with the results obtained that in
many instances when families have
moved into a district where attend-
ance at school has been possible,
they have asked for the correspon-
dence lessons to be retained.
The Correspondence Schools are
constantly being improved. Libra-
ries are now being established in
connection with some, the most
successful so far being that in South
Australia. This library is being
heavily drawn on by parents as well
as children. Because colour is now
recognised as having an important
appeal in education, the New South
Wales Correspondence School recent-
ly introduced a duplicating machine
which turns out lessons in colour.
Maps, charts, diagrams, pictures.,
and in particular lessons for the
infant classes, are reproduced in
colour on this machine.
Figures for the two largest Cor-
respondence Schools are interesting.
The Queensland School has over
8, 000 boys and girls enrolled from
north-west Queensland, the Northern
Territory, Central Australia, New
Guinea, and the New Hebrides. The
New South Wales School has 178
teachers for 6, 000 pupils. These Cor-
respondence Schools have served
their purpose well, and will continue
to do so as long as the population of
inland Australia remains small and
scattered.
A recent innovation, however,
gives promise of being a big improve-
ment on the correspondence sys-
tem. A short time ago the first
broadcast of what is known as"`The
School of the Air"was given from
Alice Springs in Central Australia.
Broadcasts to schools are not unu-
sual ; they are being successfully
used in many parts of the world.
With these, however, the children
only listen. The new Australian
school not only broadcasts to the
children, but the children may
answer back and ask questions over
the radio as welL This is unique
in the he. story of education.
Under this new method youngsters
can he taught as well as if they
were in the classroom with the
teacher. The scheme relies for its
success on the close co-operation of
the now world-famous Flying Doctor
Service. The Flying Doctor scheme
uses specially-invented pedal wire-
less sets with which people in isolat-
ed places may call up the nearest
Flying Doctor base at any hour.
These transceivers are radio sets
which transmit as well as receive.
The pedal wireless was so called
because the user pushed the pedals
beneath the set in the same manner
as those of a bicycle to generate
current for transmitting, while he
or she spoke the message into a
small mouthpiece. Today the pedals
are only used in emergencies, as
most of the transceivers are battery-
operated. This set is very simple to
operate, requiring no technical know-
ledge whatever. The Flying Doctor
can speak to the caller, and the
caller may in turn speak to the
doctor. Knowing this, three peo-
ple decided in 1945 that these pedal
wireless sets could be used to teach
children over the air. These people
were Miss Adelaide Meitke, South
Children whose parents live in the lonely cattle lands of the Australian"outback"would have to travel hundreds of miles to
attend the nearest school. Postal services and the radio are now used to bring education to the most isolated families.

### 70230: Australia's bush country children 'talk back' to their teachers

COURIER APRIL 1953. Page
Radio has taken some isolation from the lives of people living in the lonely places of the world. In Australia, for example,
it has made possible a unique educational experiment. Three times a week a teacher in a Central Australian town gives
lessons by radio to some 300 isolated children. Each child has a transreceiver radio for question-and-answer sessions.
Australian Inspector of Schools, Mr.
Graham Pitts, director of the Flying
Doctor base at Alice Springs, and Mr.
Les Dodd, headmaster of the Alice
Springs School, and now Northern
Territory Director of Education.
At the Alice Springs Higher Pri-
mary School a studio with a full
transmission panel was established,
and a land-line constructed from
this studio to the Flying Doctor base,
Every Monday, Wednesday, and Fri-
day, the head teacher at Alice
Springs speaks to 300 children seated
round their pedal radios within a
radius of 400 miles. Not only chil-
dren, but parents and stockmen
crowd round to listen. After each
lesson children on stations a hun-
dred miles apart ask the head
teacher questions on the lesson, as
well as on other subjects.
The scheme is as yet only in itf
infancy, but it is already planned to
step up the lessons to five a week.
When it is realized that there are
now seven other Flying Doctor bases
similar to that at Alice Springs, the
expansion possibilities are obvious.
With the introduction of this
scheme the education of children
living in the outposts of the Empire
has moved forward yet another step.
By lessening the'problem for
parents, this unique.'School of the
Air"is making a big contribution
towards a better life for those who
work and live in the isolated areas
of outback Australia.
A diamond drill team investigates one of Australia's vast mineral deposits. Today, the children of these technicians are
no longer deprived of lessons because they are out of reach of normal means of education. They go to school'buy radio'.

### 70231: The Australian Echidna and the Kookabura bird go on the air

THE AUSTRALIAN
ECHIDNA AND THE
KOOKABURA BIRD
GO ON THE AIR
THANKS to an international ex-change of school broadcasts init-
iated by the Canadian Broad-
casting Corporation, the Toronto zoo
has now added a zoological wonder-
an Australian Echidna, one of the few
remaining links with prehistoric fife-
to its collection of animas.
The Echidna, better-known as a Spiny
Ant-Eater, was presented to the CBC
by the Australian government to
mark the beginning of a series of
exchange broadcasts. For the first
time, through a plan initiated by CBC,
Canadian school children are hearing a
series of six school broadcasts integrated
with their curriculum and prepared by
the Australian Broadcasting Commission.
likewise Australian children are receiv-
ing a series of six programmes prepared
by the CBC, about life in Canada.
The Echidna, which plays a starring
role in one of the Australian series of
programmes about birds and animals of
that country, arrived recently at Toronto
after crossing the Pacific by air and then
making another air trip across Canada
from Vancouver. It was then presented
to the City of Toronto at a ceremony
in the CBC studios formally marking the
Canada Australia exchange of school
broadcasts, which began with Australian
programmes for the benefit of Ontario
school-children.
Champion digger
RANKING as one of Australia'squeerest creatures, the Echidna
bears some resemblance to the
Canadian porcupine, and is about the
size of a hedgehog. Its back is covered
with long, sharp, yellowish-black spines,
like those of a porcupine, but any other
resemblance is purely accidental. It is,
however, a close relative of the famous
duck-billed platypus.
The Echidna is a mammal, growing
hair between its spines, and suckling its
young. But it also lays eggs, which
it keeps within a special pouch until
they hatch. The adult Echidna is about
12 inches long, and for its size, has few
rivals as a digger. Working in soft
ground, it can dig itself out of sight in
a few minutes, and an Echidna has
been known to dig itself through a con-
crete-floored enclosure, if a crevice in
which to start working exists.
The Toronto Zoo has a good collec-
tion of Australian animals and birds, but
no Echidna, so the new arrival from
Australia is a valuable addition. Echid-
nas normally feed on ants and small
insects which they pick up with a long,
sticky tongue. They also eat eggs and
milk, and for that reason are easy to
feed. Although Echidnas are always
trying to escape, they usually live a long
time in captivity.
Exchange broadcasts
DESIGNED to give children of eachcountry a better understanding of
life in the other, the school radio
exchange programmes between the CBC
and the Australian Broadcasting Com-
mission have been more than one year in
production. Six months were spent in a
study of the varying school curricula
in the Australian states and the Cana-
dian provinces, and another six months
in preparation and revision of, scripts and
production of the actual recordings.
The firSt series of six programmes
from Australia deal with animals and
birds-the Echidna, the Kangaroo, the
Koala, the Platypus, the Kookabura Bird
and the lyre Bird. The first six pro-
grammes sent to Australia by the CBC
deal with three Canadian animates-the
moose, bear and the beaver-and also
with different aspects of life in Can-
ada : a visit to a British Columbian
logging camp, a day in the life of a
northern fur trapper, and a trip down the
Great lakes in a freighter.

DECENTLY, the world's newspapershave published ma y hoto-
graphs of the disastrous results
of the storm which in February
crumbled the dikes of southwest
Holland and flooded a great part of
this area. Those published on this
page record a victory in Hol-
land's unending fight with the sea.
They show the transformation of
Schokland, which was once a real
island (right), noted for its hardy
fishermen, until a great dike dam-
med off the Zuider Zee from the
North Sea, the sea water was drained
out and the vast bed of the new lake
filled with fresh water from its tri-
butary rivers. The Zuider Zee be-
came the Ijsselmeer-after its main
river, the Ijssel. Then, as the land
began to'"eat"into the water, Schok-
land, just over a mile long and 45
feet wide at its narrowest part, ceas-
ed to be an island. Today, sur-
rounded by a chess-board pattern of
cultivated fields (above), it houses
the"Zuider Zee Museum"in which
relics found on the bed of the lake
have been collected. On a neighbour-
ing island, Urk, the people resisted
a project to"imprison"their home
in the newly reclaimed polders, and
were finally left with a mile or so of
coast bordering on the Ijsselmeer, so
that they could continue their tradi-
tional calling as (fresh water) fisher-
men. For story of one-off these Dutch
polders, see page 3. (Photos : K. L. M.)
