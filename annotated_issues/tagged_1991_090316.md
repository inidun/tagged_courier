UNESCO'S FIRST 45 YEARS (Part II 
by Michel Conil Lacoste 
  
Many newly independent 
countries join UNESCO 
1960 
General policy 
® In this year alone, 17 African countries (and one 
other) join UNESCO, which now has 99 Member 
States. Many newly independent and developing 
countries join UNESCO in the 1960s, bringing to 
the Organization its universality of thought and 
action. One important result of this broadening is 
the intensification of operational activities in the 
field. 
 
Education 
B® A resolution adopted by the General Assembly 
of the United Nations recognizes education, 
hitherto considered exclusively in 2 humanist per- 
spective, as a factor in economic development. 
This decision holds great importance for the 
future orientation of UNESCO's activities in 
education. 
® The Convention against Discrimination in 
Education is adopted. Today 76 States are Parties 
to the Convention. 
8 Three intergovernmental conferences are con- 
vened by UNESCO in Karachi, Beirut and Addis 
Ababa on educational needs in Asia, in the Arab 
States and in Africa respectively. At Karachi 18 
countries draw up a plan for the development 
of primary education in Asia. 
® The International Council of Sport and Phys- 
ical Education (later the International Council of 
Sport Science and Physical Education) holds its 
first General Assembly. The Council came into 
being as a result of co-operation, encouraged by 
UNESCO, between representatives of national 
and international bodies concerned with sport 
during the Olympic Games held in Melbourne 
(1956) and Rome (1960). 
Exact and natural sciences 
 
® The Intergovernmental Oceanographic Com- 
mission (a semi-autonomous body within 
UNESCO) is established. The Commission pro- 
motes scientific research into the ocean and its 
living and non-living resources through concerted 
action by its Member States. Its first task is to 
co-ordinate the International Indian Ocean Expe- 
dition (1959-1965). 
® The International Brain Research Organiza- 
tion (IBRO) is founded. 
® ECOSOC examines a survey carried out by 
UNESCO, at the request of the UN General 
Assembly, on current trends of enquiry in the 
natural sciences and on the dissemination and 
application for peaceful purposes of such 
knowledge. The results of the survey appear in 
a book, Current Trends in Scientific Research, 
produced under the direction of Prof. Pierre 
Auger and published jointly by the UN and 
UNESCO in 1961. 
Culture 
® The campaign to save the monuments of 
Nubia from flooding by the waters of the Aswan 
High Dam is launched. Presiding at a ceremony 
at UNESCO headquarters, André Malraux com- 
mends “the action of a man who snatches some- 
thing from death”. The campaign lasts 20 years; 
22 shrines and temples are moved, 40 technical 
missions from 5 continents participate, and the 
contributions of governments and other inter- 
national sources, public and private, total $56 
million.

General policy 
® November: following the resignation of Vit- 
torino Veronese for health reasons, René Maheu 
René Maheu In 1962, the year In which he was 
elected Dirsctor-General of UNESCO. 
 
(France) becomes acting Director-General. He is 
elected Director-General in 1962. 
® The International Convention for the Protec- 
tion of Performers, Producers of Phonograms 
and Broadcasting Organizations (the “Rome 
Convention) is drawn up jointly by UNESCO, 
the World Intellectual Property Organization 
(WIPO) and the International Labour Organi- 
sation (ILO). 
 
Education 
® An educational co-operation programme 
between UNICEF and UNESCO begins, 
notably in primary and early childhood edu- 
cation. 
® The first Regional Conference of Ministers of 
Education is held at Addis Abeba. Between 1961 
and 1986, 24 such conferences are held (for 
Africa; Latin America and the Caribbean; the 
Arab States; Asia and the Pacific; and Europe). 
® An emergency programme is launched as part 
of UN action to maintain educational services 
in Congo-Léopoldville (today Zaire). More than 
a hundred specialists are sent and help is provided 
for the recruitment of some 800 teachers. 
Exact and natural sciences 
 
® UNESCO sends a mission into the seismic 
zones of Asia, South Americaand Africa, leading 
to the creation of a study programme on earth- 
quakes and other natural hazards. 
® UNESCO establishes in Rome the Interna 
tional Computation Centre (ICC) later to 
become the Intergovernmental Bureau of Infor- 
matics (IBI). 
 
Culture 
® The UNESCO Collections of Traditional 
Music are launched in collaboration with the 
IMC (150 LPs released by 1986). Today the Col- 
lections have been issued on 50 compact discs. 
1% 
Education 
 
® In co-operation with the United Nations Spe- 
cial Fund, UNESCO begins action on projects 
to establish teacher training colleges (more than 
35 in Africa) at which thousands of teachers will 
be trained.

Exact and natural sciences 
® The International Cell Research Organization 
(ICRO) is founded. 
® The International Institute of Seismology and 
Earthquake Engineering is founded in Japan. 
 
Social sciences 
WM —A series of regional studies carried out by 
UNESCO on the status of women are published 
in a special issue of the International Social Science 
Journal, In tandem with these studies, 
experimental projects are launched in Chile, in 
Nepal and in Upper Volta in order to promote 
women’s access to education. 
Communication 
 
® A resolution adopted by the General 
Assembly of the United Nations acknowledges 
the role of the media in education and in eco- 
nomic and social progress, thus extending 
UNESCO's field of action to information and 
communication. 
193 
General policy 
® The first edition is published of the UNESCO 
Statistical Yearbook, which becomes a standard 
source of facts and figures on the world situa- 
tion in education, science and culture. Compiled 
each year with the co-operation of UNESCO 
 
National Commissions, national statistical 
services and the statistical office of the United 
Nations, its data are taken from periodical reports 
provided by Member States on laws, regulations 
and statistics relating to their educational, scien- 
tific and cultural activities and from replies to 
UNESCO questionnaires sent from some 200 
countries and territories, 
Education 
® The first fund in trust project is launched after 
an offer by the Swedish government in favour 
of the education of women in Africa. “Funds in 
trust” are put at UNESCO's disposal by certain 
countries to finance specific activities to be 
executed by UNESCO in a specific Member 
State. 
® The General Conference decides to establish 
the International Institute for Educational Plan- 
ning (ITEP), which opens the following year in 
Paris, The Institute’s activities are divided 
between training, research, and the dissemination 
of new concepts, methods and techniques in 
educational planning. Its annual training 
programme is mainly intended for educators 
from developing countries (42 participants from 
over 30 countries in the 1990-1991 academic 
year). 
Since it was founded, the Institute has trained 
927 educators from 131 countries through 
an annual training programme at its Paris 
headquarters, and through intensive courses 
and other training activities carried out directly 
in its Member States. Current research focuses 
on three themes: “Improving the quality of 
education”; “Financing management and 
administration of education”; “Development of 
human resources”. Publications: 650 titles to 
date.

MW 1964 marks the start of a period of intensive 
activity in education, especially in literacy work. 
® The General Conference decides to launch a 
five-year experimental world literacy programme, 
B® Three UNESCO missions are sent to Member 
States to work on the financing of education 
projects following the signature of an agreement 
with the International Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development (IBRD). 
® At its 13th session, the General Conference 
approves the terms of a programme of co- 
operation with the World Food Programme. The 
projects carried out aim to determine “how far 
food aid can contribute to improving school 
attendance and school results, and . . . facilitate 
adult education, with particular reference to 
literacy campaigns.” There is a connection, recog- 
nized by the United Nations, between food defi- 
ciency, on the one hand, and adult illiteracy and 
absenteeism among schoolchildren, on the other. 
Exact and natural sciences 
® UNESCO supports the launch of ICSU’s 
International Biological Programme. 
® Meeting in Moscow, 22 anthropologists and 
biologists from 16 countries, convoked by 
UNESCO, adopt a 13-point statement on the 
biological aspects of the race question. 
UNESCO's programme of major publications 
on this theme continues (authors include Claude 
Lévi-Strauss, Roger Bastide, Michel Leiris). 
UNESCO publications on race have been trans- 
lated into 16 languages (300,000 copies published). 
® An international conference on youth is held 
at Grenoble (France).

comes into effect. 
Education 
W Meeting in Teheran, a World Conference of 
Ministers of Education on the Eradication of 
[literacy endorses the experimental world 
literacy programme carried out by UNESCO (12 
projects co-financed by UNESCO, the United 
Nations and the countries concerned). 
There is wide acceptance of the notion of 
“functional literacy”, which is a departure from 
a conception in which learning to read and write 
is regarded as an end in itself, and closely links 
literacy to the exercise of rights, responsibilities 
and aptitudes in the professional, social, civic and 
cultural fields. 
 
Exact and natural sciences 
 
® A first Regional Conference on the Applica- 
tion of Science and Technology to Development 
(CASTALA) is convened in Santiago, for Latin 
America. Six other conferences of the same type 
will be held until 1986, region by region. 
® The International Hydrological Decade 
(1965-1974), the first of several major inter- 
governmental scientific programmes, is launched. 
This programme co-ordinates research and 
training activities related to the evaluation and 
rational management of water resources in a 
hundred countries. 
® Nature and Resources, UNESCO's quarterly 
review of research on the environment, natural 
resources and the conservation of nature, is 
launched. It is currently published in English, 
French, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese and Russian).

. Were there women in politics at that time ?
- No. Politics was for men. But when I was
a child, I often used to imagine what it would
be like to be In my grandfather's shoes. Politics
didn't enter into it, I understood nothing
about hat. What mattered was the drama, the
speeches... and the audience.
So the theatre was a part of me from my
early years. And then my grandfather often
took me with him to see plays. I felt at home
there, even though I couldn't follow the plots.
In some ways it was like being at home.

WHY should the history of al-Andalus-the eight cen-
turies during which the Iberian peninsula lived under Muslim
influence-seem to many people today to be that of a golden
age ? Why is it attracting growing interest from modern
scholars, one of whom has even gone so far as to talk of
it as a " paradise lost ".
The exceptional coexistence of three cultures-Islamic,
Christian and Jewish-which was a salient feature of al-
Andalus during part of its history occurred within a historical
context marked by asperities and outbreaks of violence. From
Its beginnings in the eighth century until the fall of Granada,
the last bastion of the Muslim presence, in the fifteenth, the
history of aI-Andalus was complex and tumultuous.
But It was exceptional all the same. Al-Andalus seems
to have been a very special place where groups of people
met, talked and worked together, whereas had they lived
elsewhere at that time they would have been locked in hatred.
In spite of constant tensions, a mysterious and lasting
accord was made between a place, the people who lived there,
and the ideal they tried to put into practice-that of tolerance.
This is the extraordinary achievement of al-Andalus.
Unique in Its time, this coexistence enriched not only
the Iberian peninsula but also the Maghrib and Europe, In
ways that are only now beginning to be fully appreciated.
Through al-Andalus the foundations of Greek culture, and
elements of philosophical and scientific knowledge from
India, Persia and China were transmitted to Europe. This
Arab Spain linked Orient and Occident, past and future,
Antiquity and the Renaissance.
The present issue is an attempt, not to make a defini-
tive statement about a remarkable episode In world history
but to show some of its many facets. We have focused largely
on one period, that of the caliphate of Cordoba, the brilliant
city which was the setting for the golden age of al-Andalus.

Arabized Christians also used as a common
dialect. Meanwhile, some young Christians In the
ninth century began to turn away from Latin cul-
ture and their traditional religious education.
Some of them could read and write in Arabic,
knew pre-Islamic poetry and took up the study
of Arabic literature.
Andalusian Jews spoke Romance and Arabic
in addition to Hebrew. Installed In Spain since
Roman times, Jewish communities gave proof of
their loyalty to the Umayyad dynasty and were
not persecuted. Eight generations of Jews In al-
Andalus were to benefit from the tolerance and
protection of the Umayyad rulers.
An intellectual
and linguistic ferment
A substantial proportion of Spain's Islamic popu-
lation was bilingual. The Muslims of al-Andalus
used Romance colloquially and even In their
palaces.'Abd al-Rahman III, caliph of Cordoba
from 912 until 961 and himself the son of a Chris-
tian captive, switched easily between Arabic and
Romance when talking to his courtiers. Imperme-
able to fanaticism, he displayed exceptional toler-
ance and open-mindedness.
Two examples of his magnanimity are par-
ticularly striking. Rabi b. Zayd, baptised as
Recemundo, was a cultured Christian of Cordoba
who worked as a secretary in the offices of the
Umayyad chancellery and spoke Arabic as well
as Latin. The caliph sent him as a legate to the

German Empire and to the court of Constan-
tinople, tasks he performed so zealously that his
employer obtained for him the bishopric of the
small Andalusian town of Elvira.
Among the dignitaries of the Cordoban court
was a Jew from Jaen named Hasday ben Shaprut,
a man of great culture. The director of a finan-
cial department, he knew Arabic, Hebrew, Latin
and Greek as well as the Romance dialects. He
acted as interpreter into Arabic when Christian
envoys arrived In the capital, and also translated
into Arabic Discorides'medical treatise, sent to
'Abd al-Rahman III by the Byzantine Emperor
Constantine VII.
A distinguished doctor as well as a capable
diplomat, he successfully carried out a difficult
mission to the Christian territories, In the course
of which he helped cure King Sancho I of Leon
of obesity and also obtained ten strongholds from
the king's grandmother, old Queen Toda of
Navarre, in return for a Cordoban alliance.
Thanks to the caliph's protection, Hasday was
able to act as a patron for the Jewish writers of
Islamic Spain, and the symbiosis of Jewish and

Arabic culture was evident in the work that
resulted. The Judaeo-Spanish poet Dunash ben
Labrat even persuaded his Jewish compeers to
adopt Arabic metres for their Hebrew verses,
while the brilliant philologist Hayyudj rivalled
the Arab grammarians.
In the Spain of three religions, the Jews were
notable for their multilingualism. Spanish Jews
acted as interpreters between Christians and
Muslims. The degree to which the Jewish com-
munity in the emirate of Granada was accultu-
rated has been frequently remarked upon.
Boabdil, the last sultan of Granada, had two
Jewish Interpreters, Isaac Perdoniel and his son-
in-law Yehuda. Reviving a tradition set in the
twelfth century by the famous theologian and
doctor Ibn Maymun (Moses Maimonides), several
of whose works were composed In Arabic, the
last Jewish poet of Granada, Se'adiyah ibn Danan,
wrote his grammatical works in Arabic. When
Malaga fell to the Catholic Kings In 1487, it was
noted that several Jewish women emerged from
the town speaking Arabic and wearing Muslim
dress.
The Castilian language borrowed much from
Arabic. There were elaborate linguistic contacts,
and many Arabic words entered the Iberian lan-
guages In the Middle Ages. The influence still sur-
vives in modern Spanish, particularly In the
specialized vocabularies of irrigation, fortifica-
tion, civics, urban life, commerce, botany and
food.
The transmission
of knowledge
In terms of cultural exchange, Islamic Spain was
a link In the transmission of Hellenistic science
and Greek philosophy to the Christian West. In
Toledo throughout the twelfth century, scholars
brought together on the initiative of the arch-
bishop, Don Raimundo, translated the most
influential works of Arab culture into Latin,
notably treatises on astronomy, medicine, physics,
natural history and philosophy. The translators
of Toledo spread through medieval Europe the
works of Aristotle, Galen and Hippocrates, with
commentaries by thinkers as distinguished as
Avicenna and Averroes. 17

A century later, in 1251, the Infante Alfonso
of Castile, the son of Ferdinand III the Holy, had
the famous collection of fables known as the
Kalila wa-Dimna translated from Arabic into
Castilian. In the following centuries this was to
have a pronounced influence on Western litera-
ture, notably on the. Roman de Renart, on Boc-
caccio's Decameron, and on the 7/M of La
Fontaine.
When he became king In 1252, Alfonso sur-
rounded himself with jurists and men of science,
with historians and troubadours. He set in
motion the work of translating and adapting into
Castilian the heritage of Arabic culture. Muslims,
Christians and Arabic-speaking Jews all collabo-
rated in the task, among them Fernando of
Toledo, Juan of Aspa, Rabi Zag, Moses ha
Cohen, Abraham Alfaquin of Toledo and Master
Bernaldo el Arabigo.
In Murcia, Alfonso X founded the first college
in which adepts of the three religions could follow
the courses of the Arab scholar Muhammad al-
Riquti, originally from the district of Ricote, who
had stayed in the town after the entry of the
Castilian forces in 1266.
A model
of civilization
The pattern of life In Christian Spain was strongly
influenced by Arab civilization. From the early
Middle Ages onwards, the refined customs of the
Muslim towns penetrated the little Christian
courts of the north of the Iberian peninsula. They
brought the aristocracy a taste for luxury and a
sense of comfort.
Later, Muslim ways were adopted by the
Christian elites of Castile and Aragon. The
enthusiasm for things Arabic and Jewish shown by
Pedro I of Castile (1350-69) is often quoted by way
of example. In 1418, King Alfonso V of Aragon

wore a silk-bordered toque and gold-embroidered
vestments sent to him, along with other gifts, by
the Sultan of Granada, Muhammad VIII.
A European traveller, Leon of Rosmithal,
Baron of Bohemia, was astonished at the welcome
he received at Burgos in the palace of a powerful
lord when he visited Spain in 1466. Among the
Castilian count's entourage were several women
dressed in Muslim fashion, and he was offered
Arab-style food. In Segovia, King Henry IV of
Castile surrounded himself with Muslims and
Jews. Rosmithal recorded that he ate, drank and
dressed in the Muslim manner.
Shared games
and festivals
Some games were popular in both communities.
Chess, known in Arabic as skitrandj, was
introduced to Cordoba in the ninth century by
the musician ZIryab. It won great popularity in
al-Andalus, and was soon introduced to the
kingdom of Leon under the name of ajedrez. In
King Alfonso X's reign, it was the favourite
pastime of Castilians. The king and his wife,
Queen Violante of Aragon, shared their passion
for the game with knights and ladies of the court,
soldiers and monks, nobles and peasants, Muslims
and Jews.
Muslims and Christians also both staged
jousting tournaments. Lists were set up in the
main squares and gardens of Granada, and even
in the Alhambra itself. In the Jaen region on the
Feast of St. John, the Andalusian nobility fer-
vently competed in the juego de MM, a sport at
which the Muslims also excelled. A delegation of
the King of Granada achieved great success at the
court of John II of Castile by practising this form
of jousting before the monarch.
Besides the specifically Muslim festivals, two
seasonal festivals fixed by the Julian calendar
which indicated the different periods of the fiscal
and agricultural year, were celebrated In
Andalusia. They were known by their Persian
names : Nayruz was the Iranian New Year, while
Mahradjan fell on 24 June. In the towns and the
countryside of al-Andalus, people of all social
classes commemorated these days with entertain-
ments and merry-making.
There were carnival disguises and celebrations
in the Andalusian towns just as there were in
Christian Spain. In Andalusian poetry of the
eleventh and twelfth centuries there are frequent
references to Christian religious festivals, espe-
cially Easter, known as/M&.
As early as the twelfth century, the Muslims
of al-Andalus bought pastries to celebrate the
Christian New Year and Maundy Thursday. In
the second half of the thirteenth century, Andalu-
sians began to celebrate Christmas and New Year
in imitation of their Christian neighbours. On
1 January by the Julian calendar, the day they
called Yannayr, Andalusians gave each other
presents and cooked raised pastries shaped like
towns, called mada'in, thereby anticipating the
later Christian custom of making Twelfth-cakes
for Twelfth Night, though without small gifts

### 90305: The Roots of coexistence

The social and historical ! 0/ C ? t MOC

T
THE periods between 711 and 1086 AD in the
Islamic territories of aI-AndaIus and between 1085
and 1370 in Christian Spain were golden ages of
social and cultural coexistence. What religious and
legal foundations were they based on ?
Judaism never defined a social status for other
religions, since until the Babylonian diaspora it
considered itself the only monotheistic faith.
Thereafter, when It lost its political independence,
its own social status became identified with that
of the Jewish people.
At first Christianity too had no status as an
independent social entity. Saint Paul directed
Christians to accept the Roman Empire, to pay
taxes to it, obey Its magistrates and observe its
Deta)) from a 12th-century

laws, holding that the power it exercised was
God-given. It was only after the conversion of
Constantine's day, when Christianity became the
civic religion of the Empire, and the Empire was
Christianized by the Church, that the tolerance
early Christianity had shown was gradually
eroded.
In the Middle Ages, Christians came to con-
sider Jews as deniers of the faith because they had
refused to regard Jesus of Nazareth as the
promised Messiah, and as deicides insofar as they
were held collectively responsible for his death.
As for Islam, medieval Christians at first consi-
dered it a fraud and its prophet, Muhammad, an
impostor. This view was only gradually modified
as a result of cultural coexistence on the Iberian
peninsula.
Islam, on the other hand, took as a starting-
point the fundamental unity of the Faith, as
revealed to the first man, reiterated by all the
prophets, and socially codified by divine mes-
sengers, notably by Moses in the 7b for the
Jews and by Jesus in the Gospels for Christians.
Muhammad was then sent in his turn because
these religious laws had become distorted and
were incomplete. For Muslims, Muhammad is the
final messenger, the seal set on the work of the
prophets, and the Qur'an is the true and defini-
tive revelation of the Faith.
Muslims consequently considered Jews and
Christians as People of the Book (Ahl al-Kitab),
whose incomplete systems of belief nonetheless
allowed them to know and venerate God, to
understand and obey His commandments, and to
merit eternal salvation.
People of the pact
Following the principles spelled out in the
Qur'an, Islam gave full recognition to only one
social grouping, the « K77M, the community of the
faithful, whose members are theoretically equal.

But the faith expanded into lands that were
socially highly organized and inhabited largely
by Christians and Zoroastrians, with Jewish and
Buddhist minorities. AI-AndaIus, with Its
Mozarabs and Jews, was one of these lands. All
those who possessed a revealed Book and who
agreed to a position of subordination by signing a
pact became " tributaries ". There was no legal
problem where Christians and Jews were con-
cerned. Zoroastrians, initially at least, were granted
a similar status, even though they were not con-
sidered to have a revealed Book.
Legally speaking, the tributaries did not
belong to the umma, but enjoyed protected status
as dhimmis or " people of the pact", and were
implicitly treated as the members of another
society, which did not exist in political terms but
whose religious structure assumed responsibility
for administering the tolerated social rights.
The relationship between the umma and the
ahl al-Kitab was based on the concept of a pact
which could be either expressed or tacit. In the
Christian context, the parties to the pact were,
on the one hand, the Christian nobility and
bishops, and on the other the caliph. The accord
held good not just for the Umayyad rulers of al-
Andalus but also for those of the taifas, the petty
kingdoms that flourished after the collapse of the
caliphate.
When, from the ninth century on, the Chris-
tian kingdoms of the Iberian peninsula began to
englobe sizeable Jewish and Islamic
communities-the latter of which were known
as M<e/7'M-the Christian kings took up the
Islamic policy of offering protected status. As the
incarnation of the link between the different com-
munities, the kings of Castile and Leon even
assumed, in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries,
the title of " Lord of the Three Religions ".
A unique social fabric
The way In which medieval Islamic society was
organized does not easily lend itself to forms of
class analysis practised by modern social science.
In any case, the cohabitation of Muslims with
dhimmis (Mozarabs and Jews) took different
forms in the different social strata within each
community, and the relationships that were estab-
lished did not always exactly coincide with those
prescribed by law.
Social cohabitation and cultural coexistence
worked to the advantage of the Islamic
aristocracy, the khassa, which consisted of the
ruling family and the upper ranks of the military
and civil authorities, and of the freedmen and
clients of the monarch. The notables of Islamic
society (a'yan)-men of learning, successful
craftsmen, merchants and great land-owners-also
benefited from the arrangement. The masses, on
the other hand, found it hard to live alongside
Mozarabs and Jews.
Among the Mozarabs, those who had the
closest cultural connections with Muslims were
the nobility ; a class composed of the descendants
of the Visigothic comites, the upper ranks of the
clergy and some scholars. We know from the
writings of such strong champions of the 21

Mozarabic identity as Alvaro and Eulogio of Cor-
doba that they associated with Muslims, shared
their literary tastes and fashions, and even took
pride in speaking good Arabic.
As for the Jews, the guides (rabbis and
scholars), rich merchants, traders and financiers
also associated with the Islamic and Mozarabic
upper classes, but had almost no dealings with
the lower social orders. Cultural coexistence
between Jews and Muslims was, however, more
tangible than that between Muslims and
Mozarabs, because the Jews had accepted Arabic
as their language of thought and culture.
The law known as the fiqh maliki proved an
effective instrument for regulating the relations
between the different social groups. It had origi-
nated in certain traditional Arab usages dating
from the pre-lslamic period that reflected the
influence of Roman jurisprudence and had
provided a basis for the " canonical " principles
of Islam.
Craftsmen, shopkeepers, merchants and small
landowners of the Mozarabic and Jewish com-
munities were able to maintain their traditional
way of life without much difficulty. Obviously,
though, this process of convergence broke down
whenever religious disputes arose.
Patterns of coexistence
Cultural coexistence took many forms, weaving
a pattern of contact and tradition, creation and
rediscovery. It was of decisive importance in the
eighth, ninth and tenth centuries, when the legal
and ideological principles that gave it Its justifi-
cation were working satisfactorily.

notably Islamic cultural imports from the Orient,
and intellectual life in Muslim Spain, was
genuinely extraordinary, as a glance at the art,
astronomy, mathematics, medicine and thought
of the caliphate shows. The cultural legacy of al-
Andalus is impressive in its scale and splendour
even though, for obvious reasons, Mozarab cul-
ture was closed to some aspects of Islamic
thought. Jewish thinking, on the other hand, was
so open to Muslim influences that two parallel
yet communicating currents are apparent in
Andalusian philosophy : on the one hand the
Arab-Islamic tradition of Avempace, Ibn Tufayl
and Averroes, on the other the Judaeo-Arab
heritage of Ibn Gabirol and Maimonides, thinkers
who used Arabic as their medium of expression.
There were certainly differences between
Islamic and Jewish culture, but they did not
extend to such common and universal fields as
astronomy, mathematics, science, medicine, logic
and metaphysics. One example, taken from my
own speciality, philosophy, will suffice to show

the creative possibilities that sprang from cultural
coexistence.
Comparisons have often been made between

Ghazali's work Te/McoC7-CMce o/c t/o.
It is undeniable that the three works are unique
of their kind and in their time. The similarities
between them lie in certain common themes of
medieval thought, in the use of certain formal
procedures, and In their method.
It is true that the Incoherence of the Incoher-
ence cannot be understood without reference to
specifically Islamic ideas ; similarly, the Guide of
the Perplexed raws on the rabbinical tradition,
and the Summa contra gentiles on the Christian
Inheritance. Yet all three heritages share a
common link with Greek thought, but not as it
had been recreated by Islamic philosophy.

a complex one, full of reciprocal influences. Two

Cultural coexistence of this kind was made
possible by religious and legal principles that were
far-reaching In their implications even though
they were often transgressed In practice. The
Andalusian experience was an exceptional
moment In history, probably unique In Its own
time and rarely matched In any other. Its most
worthy, notable and creative feature was that
cohabitation and coexistence were based on reli-
gious and legal principles. Our own era, which
prides itself on the liberalism and universality of
Its ideas, offers few examples to match It.

i. N the year 93 of the Islamic era-the Hijra-
and 711 of the Christian era, the great Muslim
Arab empire was ruled from Damascus in Syria
by al-Walid I, sixth caliph of the House of
Umayya. From Kairouan in the country now
called Tunisia, al-Walid's governor, Musa ibn
Nusayr, was pursuing a policy of westward
expansion spearheaded by his Berber freedman
Tariq, commander of some 7, 000 Berbers from
North Africa. Before the end of the spring of 93
Tariq was on the rock from which Gibraltar takes
its name-Jabal Tariq, " Mount Tariq ".
Tariq's landing was the first step on a long,
hard road which led 200 years later to the estab-
lishment of the caliphate of Cordoba by a scion
of the House of Umayya. The second step was
the conquest of the lands beyond Gibraltar. With
his Berber troops, greatly reinforced from North
Africa, Tariq soon defeated the Visigothic King
Rodrigo, already harassed in the north by the
Basques. The tottering, unpopular Visigothic
regime was now doomed. The fall of its capital,
Toledo, to the north was followed in October
711 by the capture of Cordoba in the south.
July 712 saw Musa himself in the Iberian
peninsula. Grudging his freedman the glory of
conquest, he had crossed the Straits of Gibraltar
with some 18, 000, mainly Arab, troops. His rela-
tionship with Tariq was strained, but this did not
prevent them from pursuing their common
objective of conquest. By 714 Musa and Tariq had
conquered all but the most inaccessible parts of
the peninsula and gained for the Umayyad crown
in Damascus a jewel of impressive resplendence.
To this new, rich province the Arabs gave the
name " al-Andalus ", which is thought to derive
from " Vandalicia ", the name the Vandals gave
to the old Roman province of Baetica In southern
Spain. In English, " al-Andalus " is often translated
as " Andalusia ", but in its strict sense it designates
Muslim Spain.
Like Rome, the Cordoba of the Umayyad
caliphate was not built in a day. The glitter of
that golden city did not materialize like Aladdin's
genie at the rub of a magic lamp. It was born of
the Umayyad emirate, and behind its glitter there
lay a long and complex history.
The establishment of
the Umayyad emirate in Spain
In 750 the'Abbasid revolution in the east swept
away the Syrian Umayyad caliphate and savagely
butchered its princes. Miraculously, one of the
latter,'Abd al-Rahman, grandson of the caliph
Hisham, cheated his hunters of their prey and
embarked on a perilous odyssey that took him
to Morocco, where he won the protection of his
mother's Berber tribe. After careful thought he
decided to go to Spain, banking on support from
elements owing loyalty to the Umayyads. Once
on Andalusian soil, he played his hand and
won-despite some militant opposition to his
cause. In May 756, his final battle won, he entered
the provincial palace of Cordoba. There, in the
city's mosque, he led the Eriday prayer and was
proclaimed emir of al-Andalus. A young man in
his mid-twenties at the time, he was to reign for
over thirty years as the first of five Umayyad
rulers of Spain to bear the name'Abd al-Rahman.24

The establishment of the emirate was on !)
the start of a gruelling climb to power whos<
complexity is explained by the pattern of Andalu
sian society at that time. Al-Andaius was ;
country in which Arab and Berber immigrant :
had, at different times and under differing con
ditions, settled among the great mass of thé
HIspano-Roman population. Many Hispano
Romans had converted to Islam and, as neo
Muslims (muwalladun), become completel)
Arabized. Yet there remained a large Christiar
HIspano-Roman community of Mozarabs- :
term taken from the Spanish form of an Arabi (
word meaning " Arabizer ". As well as their owr
language, the Mozarabs spoke Arabic and adoptee
many Arab customs. Finally, there were the
native Iberian Jews.
The Mozarabs and Jews caused'Abd al
Rahman no trouble. They were only too glad tc
be rid of Visigothic tyranny and to live in peace
The Arabs, however, were to turn any dream :
of peace he may have cherished into something
of a nightmare born of tribal feuds, jealousies anc
grievances, which led to sedition, armed conflict
and open rebellion. Moreover, the Berber :
resented not being treated as equals by their Arab
fellow-Muslims, whose traditions and culture
were quite different from their own.
And so, the prospect of revolts and uprising :
was very real. The emir perceived the risk oJ
siding with any single group within al-AndaIus
He could count on unselfish loyalty from no one
not even from his Umayyad relations and clients
And so he recruited a highly disciplined profes
sional army of Berber mercenaries and slave
troops from Europe north of the Pyrenees. This
was the only answer to internal turmoil anc
external danger from the Christian north.
'Abd aI-Rahman was a Syrian, and the
administrative system he created In Muslim Spain
was in the Syrian Umayyad tradition. At It<
centre he made his own office of emir a unifying
symbol, and in the provinces he appointed loyal
and capable governors.
When he died In 788, he could be said to have
proved himself an extraordinarily able statesman ;
whose greatest achievement had been to pacify
and defend his realm. Today we see him as the
founder of a dynasty that lasted more than twice
as long as that of his Syrian ancestors and became
a light that far outshone the brightest lights In
contemporary Europe.
An eventful history
All his successors sought, with varying degree*
of success, to consolidate their political and mill-
tary strength In a situation that was fraught with
danger.
In many areas of the Iberian peninsula corn-
munications and transport militated against firm
central control. Local notables, appointed a<
governors to uphold Umayyad authority in
regions far from Cordoba, acted as powerful over
lords serving not their ruler's interests but their
own, and often taking the opportunity to rebel.
This was particularly the case in the"Marches".

Christian realms to the north from the emirate's

The attitudes of the nee-Muslims and
Mozarabs also changed, leading to insurrection
and disorder. Cordoba itself was the home of cer-
tain Muslim political and religious malcontents. 25

Umayyads founded tn the
10th century near Cordoba.
At the same time, the emirate was saddled with
the perennial need to protect its northern borders
against Christian invaders.
During the reign of ai-Hakam I (796-822)
there was a spate of troubles : disaffection in
Toledo, savagely crushed in 797 by the massacre
of its mainly neo-Muslim notables ; the mass
uprising in 818 of the so-called Suburb
( " Arraval ") of Cordoba, encouraged by disgrun-
tled Muslim religious leaders and ruthlessly put
down ; protracted campaigns In the Marches of
Saragossa, Toledo and Merida against recalcitrant
leaders ; and, finally, the permanent loss of Barce-
lona to the Christians.
The emirate faced two other thorny
problems. First, the initially peaceful Mozarabs
became involved in a serious religious protest
begun by Christian fanatics seeking martyrdom
through public denunciation of the Prophet
Muhammad. The protest, starting late in the reign
of the kind and tolerant ruler'Abd al-Rahman
II (822-852), led to tensions and conflicts which
neither the prince nor many of his Christian sub-
jects relished. Secondly and more importantly,
the reign of Muhammad I (852-886), witnessed
In 880 a determined attempt by Ibn Hafsun, a
rebel of neo-Muslim descent and later an apostate,
to make himself ruler of aI-AndaIus from his
centre of power, Bobastro, in the south of Spain.
His insurrection, which commanded wide non-
Arab support, dragged on for almost fifty years.
Largely because of ai-Hakam I's draconian
measures to enforce peace, his son'Abd al-
Rahman II, a very able monarch, enjoyed some
thirty years of relative calm and prosperity,
marked by significant improvements in the
administrative system and a sharp rise in stan-
dards of culture and civilization. The emir's
enthusiastic patronage of music and the arts was
matched only by his zealous preoccupation with
the creation of a strong navy capable of out-
classing Norse squadrons that had found his
shores a gateway to rich pickings.
An exceptional ruler
The most disastrous period In the emirate's his-
tory came with the reign of'Abd Allah (888-912),
whose legacy to his grandson and successor'Abd
aI-Rahman III (912-961) was nothing but an
empty treasury and the general disintegration of
Umayyad Spain. This legacy of leaden metal was
to be miraculously transmuted into gold by the
alchemy of a ruler who at the time of his acces-
sion was barely in his twenties. Endowed with
patience, emotional stability and maturity of
judgement beyond his years, the young'Abd al-
Rahman combined the energy and stamina of
youth with political acumen and unswerving
devotion to duty. As much European as Arab-
his mother and paternal grandmother were of
Christian stock-he was an observant Muslim but
no fanatic. Throughout his reign he adopted,
whenever possible, a generally tolerant policy
towards Mozarabs and Jews.

Upon his succession,'Abd aI-Rahman
brooked no opposition to his authority.
Governors who refused or ignored his request for
allegiance had to yield either to diplomatic per-
suasion or to force. In 913 he imposed his rule
on the important city of Seville. The next year
saw the start of a long war of attrition against Ibn
Hafsun of Bobastro, the master of much of
southern Spain. The struggle, continued by his
sons after his death In 917, ended only in 928.
It was not until 932 that the pacification of al-
Andalus was complete, with the submission of
the AIgarve, eastern Spain, Toledo, Saragossa and
other important strongholds.
The apogee of the caliphate
The most memorable event in Spanish Umayyad
history took place in 929 : the establishment of
the caliphate. In proclaiming himself caliph,'Abd
aI-Rahman III assumed, In addition to the caliphal
title " Commander of the Faithful ", the throne-
name"Defender (aI-Nasir) of God's Religion ".
The decision to revive the caliphate, lost by the
Syrian Umayyads in 750, was largely his response
to the growing power and prestige of the Shi'ite
Fatimids, who had proclaimed their own
caliphate in North Africa and were coming dan-
gerously near to al-Andalus.
When he died In 961, al-Nasir had enforced

While the West saw the soft, lunar reflection of God,
the East and Arab and Jewish Spain contemplated
him In his fertile Sun, in His creative power which
pours forth His gifts in torrents. Spain was the field
of combat. Where the Christians appeared, there
was desert ; where the Arabs were, water and life
spurted forth on all sides, streams flowed, the earth
grew green, became a garden of flowers. And the
field of intelligence also flourished. What would we
barbarians have been without them ? Shameful to

a strong central government. Me had made al-
Andalus second to none in the Western world,
prospering thanks to a thriving domestic
economy and a lucrative network of pan-
Mediterranean trade. Cordoba, with about ten
times the population of Paris, far outshone any
other capital in Europe. In reputation and pres-
tige, it surpassed Baghdad and rivalled Byzantine
Constantinople, through diplomatic exchanges
with which the caliph had ensured that his realm
was seen as its equal. European envoys from
France, Germany, Italy and elsewhere had eagerly
made their way to his court. In addition to mis-
sions from North Africa, part of which he actu-
ally ruled, he had received delegations from Chris-
tian Spain, some of whose rulers he had made his
tributaries.
His successor, aI-Hakam II (961-976), was able
to preserve his father's heritage of peace and
prosperity. One of the biggest and best libraries
of Islam was born of his passion for books and
learning-a passion which also compelled him to
promote scholarship, both religious and secular
(astronomy and mathematics, for example), and
to provide some education for the poor. In the
Great Mosque of Cordoba, which stands to this
day as a lasting memorial to Umayyad glory, he
expressed his deep piety and refined artistic taste
by almost doubling Its size through the addition
of a most pleasing extension and enhancing its
prayer niche with ornamentation so exquisite as
to make it a masterpiece.
Al-Hakam's death was the death of true
Umayyad rule. The reign of his son HIsham II

accession-led to the caliphate's slide into extinc-

### 90307: Córdoba the magnificent

The mMg K-nc o  -ctMry c M/
D
BEFORE the foundation of the Umayyad
caliphate by'Abd al-Rahman III at Cordoba in
929, the cultural and scientific development of
Muslim Spain had been that of a modest offshoot
of a simple provincial Arab Muslim culture that
was highly dependent on Oriental Islam.
Under the caliphate a cultural flowering came
about, largely because Cordoba became increas-
ingly important politically. The city was the
centre of a strong and respected power which
sought, consciously or unconsciously, to equal
the prestige of the'Abbasid caliphate of Baghdad
at the height of its splendour and to create in al-
Andalus the conditions for similar achievements.
The Andalusians did not aspire to create a new
civilization but to imitate or outstrip Baghdad in
every field.
We must beware of the chronological errors
that are often made by those who attribute en
bloc to the Cordoban caliphate all the cultural
achievements of the Andalusian civilization. To
take one example, the oldest and not least original
parts of the Great Mosque of Cordoba were

completed under the emirate, not during the
caliphate. It was only after the caliphate, at the
time of the taifas (principalities governed by petty
kings) that Andalusian poetry attained its greatest
refinement. Some of the best-known monuments
of Muslim Andalusian art, such as the Giralda
(the minaret of the Almoravid mosque in Seville)
and the Alhambra palace, built by the sultans of
Granada from the late thirteenth century
onwards, date from long after the time of the
caliphs.
All the same, the most remarkable achieve-
ments of Arab Andalusian culture do bear the
imprint of the relatively short-lived caliphate,
which only lasted around a century.
An influential
capital
In the tenth century Cordoba became one of the
leading political and cultural centres of the
Muslim world, a city comparable in importance
to Baghdad and Cairo. The geographer Ibn
Hawqal, who visited Cordoba In the second half
of the century, judged It to be equal to " half of
Baghdad", and wrote that it " has no equivalent
In the whole of the Maghrib, nor in Upper
Mesopotamia, Syria or Egypt with regard to the
size of Its population, Its extent, the spaciousness
of its markets, Its cleanliness, the architecture of
its mosques and its large number of baths and
caravanserais ".
At a time when the greatest cities of Western
Europe had no more than a few thousand inhabi-
tants, Cordoba had a population of at least a
hundred thousand and extended over several
hundred hectares (tenth-century Barcelona
occupied less than ten hectares !).
The first caiiph,'Abd aI-Rahman III, who
reigned until 961, built the vast palatine city of
Madinat aI-Zahra'on the lower slopes of the hills
along the northern bank of the Guadalquivir, a

few kilometres downstream from Cordoba. In
contrast to the paucity of our information about
Cordoba itself, we know the precise area of this
Versailles of the Andalusian caiiphs thanks to
archaeological and written evidence. Madinat al-
Zahra'was almost completely abandoned at the
end of the caliphate, to whose wealth and power
Its ruins bear eloquent witness.
The walls enclosed about a hundred hectares,
with room for several tens of thousands of Inhabi-
tants. The city was dominated by palaces and
gardens on several evels, which have been exca-
vated and partially restored. Spanish archaeolo-
gists and architects have done notable work in
reconstituting the salon rico, a lavishly decorated
building which gave onto a wide esplanade In the
centre of which was an enormous pool. We know
from written evidence that this edifice was used
for official audiences.
The apotheosis
of the mosque
Equally sumptuous was the extension of the Cor-
doban mosque carried out by the son and suc-
cessor of'Abd al-Rahman III, aI-Hakam II, who
reigned from 961 to 976. The finest part of the
building, around the mihrab, the niche in the wall
which shows believers the direction of Mecca
towards which they must turn to pray, was
adorned with magnificent arches In a new style,
a highly complex design of interwoven, multifoil
horseshoe arches, decorated with interlaced
marble and other sculpted stonework enriched
with white or red polychrome patterns.
The polychrome decoration recalls the con-
trast between red and white In the alternating
stone and brick archstones'which were an original
feature of the oldest parts of the mosque, built
during the emirate. However, the similarity
between the two phases of construction Is limited
to a few discreet echoes of this kind. The simple
elegance of the eighth-and ninth-century arches
contrasts strongly with the exuberant ornamen-
tation of those built under aI-Hakam II, which
are a brilliant testimony to the wealth of the
caliphate at the height of Its power, and to the
inventiveness and virtuosity of the artists who
worked for it.
The most outstanding features of the part of
the Great Mosque built during the caliphate are
undoubtedly the magnificent domes In the
antechamber to the mihrab and above the cen-
tral nave leading to it. They were built using a
technique of interlaced stone arches or ribbing
which was quite new in Andalusian art, and had
a strong influence on later " Hispano-Moorish "
art from the twelfth to the fourteenth centuries.
Some art historians even believe that these original
forms of Andalusian art may have influenced the
development of ogival art in Christian Europe.

Although these forms were intrinsically
decorative, and their effect was enhanced by the
polychrome work described above, the architects
and decorators of Cordoba went even further by
using mosaic. Craftsmen had to be brought from
distant lands to execute this technique, which was
rarely employed in medieval Islam. For this the
caliphate mobilized its financial resources, the
technical skills of Its craftsmen, and also its diplo-
matic relations, soliciting the help of the emperor
at Constantinople, who sent a cargo of coloured
glass cubes to Cordoba as well as a master mosal-
cist to get the work underway and instruct local
craftsmen in the intricacies of the new technique.

was a cultural crossroads. A more detailed look
at the building will help to show why this is so.
The old columns and capitals that were re-
used in the Great Mosque were brought from
Roman buildings elsewhere in Spain or even from
much farther afield, in particular from what is
today Tunisia where there were many ancient
ruins.
The origin of the horseshoe-shaped arches so
characteristic of Hispano-Muslim art is a vexed
question. The form is found occasionally in the
Middle East at the time of the Umayyads and the
possibility cannot be excluded that it was deliber-
ately imported from Syria by the emirs.
However, it is generally considered to be a bor-
rowing from Visigothic art, that is from the
indigenous architecture that existed In Spain
before the Muslim conquest.
Another original feature of the parts of the
Mosque built during the emirate is the superpo-
sition of two rows of arches, enabling the ceiling
to be raised to a greater height. This practice had
already been followed, though less elegantly and
less skilfully, in the great Umayyad mosque in
Damascus which may have inspired the first
builders of Cordoba. But it is more widely
believed that the idea was suggested by Roman
aqueducts, whose superimposed arcatures curi-
ously recall those in the Great Mosque. The use
of alternating archstones of white stone and red
brick may originate in local building methods
used during the later Roman Empire, or be
modelled on Oriental Umayyad buildings, them-
selves Byzantine in inspiration, such as the Dome
of the Rock in Jerusalem.
The caliphate adopted most of the styles
which had been used earlier during the emirate,
but enriched them considerably and added to
their complexity by intersecting arches,
introducing original features into their interfoil
decoration, and importing, probably from the
Orient, new techniques for constructing domes.
Underlying all this was a desire to exalt the gran-
deur of the Umayyads, without abandoning the
link with an earlier Syrian tradition.
The hand
of the ruling dynasty
However, we must not misunderstand the multi-
cultural character of the Cordoban caliphate. The
brilliant civilization that developed in Muslim
Spain, mainly from this period onwards, was cer-
tainly In part the result of spontaneous contact
between the cultures and traditions of the three
monotheistic religions that then coexisted on the
Iberian peninsula. But the exchanges that sprang
from the relations between Islam, Christianity and

Judaism were not on a basis of equality. The hand
of the ruling dynasty is everywhere evident. The
influences that contributed to the formation of
Andalusian civilization were primarily Oriental-
'Abbasid and Byzantine. And the Umayyad State
was strictly Muslim and Arab.
It would doubtless be an exaggeration to deny
the existence of local Hispanic influences in the
development of Andalusian civilization. Even if
they had wished to do so, the eighth-century
Arab-Berber conquerors could hardly have made
a clean sweep of the peninsula's pre-Islamic past.
Many elements, even If only the materials avail-
able, remained and mingled in varying propor-
tions with those brought from the east and from
North Africa. However, these elements were re-
used in a totally different context and helped in
the creation of original structures in which many
other elements taken from the Orient played a
part.
In some cases the caliphate seems to have used
the material and human resources it concentrated
In Cordoba to create works whose originality is
startling. The carved ivory caskets which are
among the most refined achievements of tenth-
century Andalusian craftsmanship are a case In
point (see photo page 27). They have few antece-
dents, although perhaps here too we should see
a certain influence from Byzantium, where ivory
carving had reached a very high standard.
But there is no doubt about the novelty of the
style nor the source of its Inspiration, since all
these objects were made in palatine workshops.
The caliphate seems to have been to some extent a
pre-condition for the creation of these ivories,
which rank among the most beautiful achieve-
ments In the history of world art. Their manufac-
ture virtually came to an end with the disappear-
ance of the caliphate.

WHO were the Mozarabs and what contribu-
tion did they make to Andalusian civilization ?
In its strict sense the term Mozarab, which only
appeared in the eleventh century, designates an
Arabized Christian, but it is more widely used
to designate the Christians of the Iberian penin-
sula who lived under Islamic domination.
The result of a complex process of rejection
of and assimilation with the dominant society and
culture, the Mozarabic community was far from
homogeneous. The " real " Mozarabs were people
who were more or less profoundly assimilated.
The status of the Christians of aI-AndaIus
depended on their initial attitudes to the Invader.
Many of them came to terms with the latter and
carved out Christian enclaves in the newly
Muslim lands. The people of cities such as
Coimbra and Santarem, which did not offer
resistance to the Invader, were spared and kept
their prerogatives. Those which did resist some-
times paid a heavy price.
Once the lands were divided among the
different groups of conquerors, the Christians
were allowed to enjoy their land and liberty In
exchange for tribute in the form of a land-tax,
the jarach, and a poll-tax, the djizia. These tributes
became more onerous as time went by and other
exceptional forms of taxation were added to
them, provoking violent outbreaks of social dis-
content.
Like the Jews, the other people of the Book,
the Christians were allowed to keep their laws,
to retain and when the case arose to choose their
civic and religious leaders, and to practise their
religion freely. At first new monasteries were
built In Cordoba as guardians of the Christian
tradition and centres of culture where Latin
remained alive. It was only later that discrimina-

tory measures appeared, such as the duty of
wearing distinctive garments and the refusal of
permission to build new places of worship.
Assimilation
and martyrdom
No statistics are available with which to trace the
course of the Islamization of the peninsula.
Doubtless this came about in stages, starting with
the rural areas where Christianization was not
deeply rooted. The practice of mixed marriages
and the close neighbourly links which were estab-
lished between peasant communities led in the
long run to a natural erosion of Christianity.
32

### 90308: The Christian contribution

Where Christianity did survive, It sometimes
took unorthodox forms. The Mozarabs were
attracted by certain heresies uch as adoptianism
which, by denying the divinity of Christ, seemed
to bear some resemblance to Islam. Christianity,
even in its dogmatic version, eventually assimilated
certain Islamic practices such as circumcision,
food taboos and even, surreptitiously, bigamy.
Assimilation also took place in the other
direction. The Muslims, while remaining faithful
to their religion, came to take part in the main
Christian festivals. Language played a decisive
role in this process of intermingling. While
Mozarabic, a Romance language, was widely
spoken (it was even used at court and in the
administration), and used in folk literature,
Arabic was adopted by the Christians as the lan-
guage of culture.
In the Arab-Andalusian melting-pot, Arabi-
zation was thus a factor of integration, the course
of which was not, however, entirely smooth. In
the ninth century, a group of Mozarabs who were
partly Arabized but remained profoundly
attached to their Christian and Visigothic roots,
were willing to sacrifice their lives in order to
preserve their identity. Most of these candidates
for voluntary martyrdom were the offspring of
mixed unions, and were thus in the eyes of society
Muslims. By making the supreme sacrifice, they
wished to denounce the attitudes of other Chris-
tians whom they considered to be too lukewarm
and assimilated. Because they feared reprisals,
many Mozarabs then preferred to convert to
Islam whilst others, wishing to keep their Chris-
tian faith, chose to take the path of exile towards
the Christian lands in the north of the peninsula.
In the tenth century, when the Cordoba
caliphate was at the height of Its splendour, a
period of peace opened for the Mozarabs. To turn
their talents to full account, some of them drew
on their dual cultural affiliations. The Calendar
of Cordoba by Recemundo (Ibn Zaid), a man of
a great culture, as versed in Latin as he was In
Arabic, and a skilful diplomat at the court of Otto
I (953), founder of the Holy Germanic Roman
Empire, bears witness to this juxtaposition of the
two Andalusian cultures, Latin-Christian and
Arab-Muslim.
This almanach, incorporating meteorological
and agronomic information and a calendar of the
festivals of Christian saints which even notes the
places where they were celebrated, is written both
in Arabic (but in Hebrew characters) and In
Latin.
Translators and commentators
The trilingualism of the Mozarabs qualified them
as translators who could build a bridge between a
Western, European culture and an Oriental cul-
ture. Among the sumptuous gifts offered to
Caliph'Abd aI-Rahman HI by the Byzantine
emperor was a manuscript of the. Historiarum
<A'M<Mg<M Z. ! n W7by the Christian writer
Orosius, a contemporary of St. Augustine. Trans-
lated into Arabic by a Mozarab, this work became
immensely popular. It enabled the Arabs to learn 33

about the Greco-Roman past and inspired some
of them to see in Arab-Andalusian history the
natural prolongation of Hispano-Christian and
Visigothic history.
The Mozarabs were not only translators but
also brilliant commentators in Arabic who con-
tributed to the transmission of Visigothic culture.
The Etymologiae, a summary of all the sacred and
profane knowledge of his time by Isidore of
Seville (sixth-seventh century), the last Father of
the Western Church, circulated with extensive
commentaries in Arabic, into which some parts
of it were even translated.
Among the Mozarabs in fact Latin seems to
have lost its traditional role as the vehicle of
knowledge and the liturgical language. Parts of
the Bible were translated early on into Arabic,
as were the canonical texts, accompanied by com-
mentaries in Arabic to guide the thoughts of
Christians, who were increasingly attracted by
Arabic literature.
The scriptures in Arabic were not only read
by Arabized Christians. Arab-Andalusian writers
of such stature as the eleventh-century theologian,
historian and poet Ibn Hazm, reveal a profound
knowledge of the Bible in works which were
written, admittedly, in order to refute the prin-
ciples of Christianity.
To sum up, it might be said that, over and
above the movements of attraction and rejection
which punctuated the coexistence between the
two communities, in the tenth century the Arab-
Andalusians assumed their Hispanic identity and
the Mozarabs their Arab identity, while con-
tinuing to respect their respective religions. This
was no small achievement in a world and at a time
when the tendency was for different peoples and
confessions to be locked in mutual ignorance and
attracted to mutual destruction, t

) UDAISM has never interrelated more closely or
more fruitfully with another culture than It did
with the Islamic civilization of al-Andalus. Even
though the status enjoyed there by Jews and
Christians as peoples of the Book was often
precarious and in some ways oppressive, the legal
position it guaranteed was, all things considered,
liberal in comparison with the conditions the
Jews encountered elsewhere in Europe, providing
as it did a high degree of legal, administrative,
fiscal and cultural autonomy.
The largely secularized character of the
Islamic civilization of al-AndaIus allowed the
peoples of the Book to consider themselves the
heirs of a great and respected cultural tradition.
The dominant language, Arabic, was less closely
wedded to the prevailing religion than Latin was
to the Roman Catholic and Eastern Churches,
and was widely used by Jews when commenting
on their own sacred texts.
The " bourgeois revolution " of the eighth and
ninth centuries in the Islamic world saw the
appearance of an entirely new Jewish society, one
very different from that of medieval Christian
Europe. While Jews in the pre-lslamic era had
mostly been farmers or small craftsmen, they
now rose to dominant positions in public life and
the upper ranks of the administration, as well as
in industry, finance and the professions.
With time and money to spare, these new
elites had wider intellectual horizons, more
refined tastes, and heightened expectations of a
more exalted spiritual life. Like their Muslim and
Christian counterparts, they devoted themselves
to science and poetry, to artistic activities and
fashionable occupations of all kinds, both serious
and frivolous. It was a time of travel, when Jewish
communities were spreading across the Islamic
lands and migrating between countries.
In linguistic terms, the symbiosis meant that
Arabic, the new international language of civili-
zation and culture, replaced the former vehicular
language, Aramaic, which henceforth was used
only for Talmudic texts. The Jews employed
Arabic In all their intellectual activities : sacred and
profane literature, science and religion, transla-
tions and commentaries on the Bible and the
Mishna. It was used for liturgical purposes, in
theological treatises, in grammars, dictionaries
and in correspondence.
Jewish and Muslim philologists alike became
aware of the kinship between Arabic, Hebrew
and Aramaic. But it was only the Jews who,
knowing all three, were in a position to lay the
foundations for a comparative study of these lan-
guages.
In literature, an examination of Jewish and
Arabic traditions, both written and oral, reveals
common elements and structures. There is a
striking similarity between, on the one hand,

Astreet in the otd Jewish
district of Cordoba.
Jewish folklore, the Talmud and the Midrash (a
collection of homilies and legends), and on the
other their Arabic counterparts, the Hadith
(spoken traditions attributed to the Prophet
Muhammad) and the Islamic verse-chronicles.
There are also common subjects and heroes-
Abraham, Moses, Job and Joseph, for example-
in the stories, verse and proverbs of the two
peoples.
Hebrew poetry was transformed by contact
with Arabic verse. Indeed, it owes the greater part
of its prosody to the Andalusian inheritance. In
the tenth century, Dunash ben Labrat laid the
foundations of a new system of scansion that
replicated the quantitative metre of Arabic verse,
whose rules he adopted. The MMMM/M/M, a poetic
form originating in al-Andalus, also became a
familiar mode of expression in Hebrew poetry.
Alongside the renewal of Oriental Jewish
styles, a novel and prestigious form of poetry
gradually developed to express the new elite's love
of art, comparable both in its form and its inner
meaning to the Arabic model. It displays a
manifest desire to emulate the intellectual and
social elites of the Muslim world.
The Arab contribution to this literary
heritage was thoroughly digested and assimilated
until it finally became a naturalized part of the
Jewish tradition. Jewish writers achieved an
almost total blending of the cultural components
of the Judaeo-Arab world of their day. At the
same time that interconfessional tensions were
abating, an attempt was made in poetry to
remove the discrepancies and discordances that
the abrupt encounter of the Hebrew language and
orthodox Jewish thought with a foreign tongue
and culture could have occasioned. One can see
in the works of Ibn Khalfon and his successors
the attempt to adapt an essentially Jewish rhetoric
to the task of describing a secular world of which
Judaism had up to that time known nothing.
The lessons of Sufism
It would be impossible to understand or even con-
ceive of the existence of Jewish spirituality and
esotericism had it not been for the Islamic
environment and the knowledge Jewish authors
had of Sufi mysticism.
A comparison of the ancient Jewish mysti-
cism centred on the Merkava, the divine chariot
described by the prophet Ezekiel, with such
Islamic practices as dhikr (ritual repetition of the
name of God) and breathing exercises might sug-
gest that archaic Jewish gnosticism contributed
to the formation of Islamic esoteric traditions. In
fact, the influence went very much in the oppo-
site direction. The relatively incoherent utter-
ances of the Jewish Gnostics of the fifth and sixth
centuries gave way to the fervent eloquence of
the Islamic mystics, who possessed in the Arabic
language a first-class means of expression. From
that time on, Muslim pietism left its mark on the
mysticism, spirituality and ethics of Judaism as
it existed on Islamic soil.
It was via Sufism that many Jewish mystics
and ascetics received their apprenticeship in a new
form of spirituality that they subsequently passed
on to their own culture, first of all in its original
language, Arabic, then through translations into
Hebrew and other vernacular languages. This
work was accomplished by such scholars as Bahya
Ibn Paquda, Abraham Abulafya, and Abraham
and Obadya Maimonides, the son and grandson
respectively of the great Moses Maimonides.
Common ground between Jewish and Muslim
mysticism and esotericism can also be found in the
practices of the Andalusian Sufis and the teachings
of Ibn'Arabi (1165-1241), a prestigious figure in
the Sufi world who was born in Murcia in Spain.
The experiences and teachings of al-Ghazali
(1058-1111), one of the greatest Islamic
philosophers and theologians, exerted a consider-
able influence on the intellectual history of the
West and the East, and especially on Jewish
thinkers. The influence was felt at two levels and
at two distinct times.
During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries,
it affected Jewish authors writing and thinking
in Arabic. One such was Judah Halevi, al-
Ghazali's most fervent disciple who, sharing his
master's view of the danger posed by philosophy
to revealed religion, took as his starting-point the36

ence of the Phiiosophers) against philosophers in
general and Aristotelian philosophy In particular.
It Is also accepted that Moses Maimonides knew
al-Ghazali's works, and especially his refutation
of philosophy.
From the thirteenth century onwards, the
works of aI-Ghazali were translated into Hebrew,
and were read, studied and commented on by
Jews in non-Arabic-speaking Provence and Spain,
where they achieved immense popularity. In fact
some of the writings of al-GhazaII and of
Averroes (Ibn Rushd), the great Cordoba-born
twelfth-century Islamic philosopher, have only
survived in Hebrew.
The communication of Greek learning
In philosophy, one of the most outstanding fea-
tures of the Judaeo-Arabic symbiosis was the
irruption of Greek science and culture into the
Jewish world through the medium of Arabic liter-
ature. The Hellenization of Jewish thought via
Islam is all the more surprising in view of the fact
that many Diaspora Jews had close and some-
times fruitful contacts with the Graeco-Latin
world.
However, the example of Philo of Alexan-
dria, a philosopher of the Diaspora who lived
sometime between the first century BC and the
second century AD and was familiar with Greek
philosophy, had no strong impact on Jewish cul-
ture, and the countless traces of the Greek lan-
guage and of Hellenic civilization that are to be
found in Talmudic or Midrashic literature sug-
gest only a superficial influence. Such a rejection
can perhaps be explained by the Jews'defensive
instinct to protect their religious identity, dictated
by an intransigent monotheism confronted with
the temptations of the paganism that Graeco-
Latin culture represented.
A more conciliatory attitude towards Greek
learning only became possible after the victory
of the monotheistic principle In the form first of
Christianity and then, more importantly, of
Islam, which was closer to Judaism in Its unitary
conception of divinity.
Judaism subsequently successfully passed the
test of Hellenization. Yet it always maintained
Its independence of Islam In the matter of reli-
gious fundamentals, even while travelling down
the paths of Muslim philosophy and accepting the
latest findings of the new sciences. This explains
why the masterworks of the Jewish theologians
and philosophers of the tenth, eleventh and
twelfth centuries, notably Ibn Gabirol and Moses
Maimonides, have remained classics of orthodox
Judaism, t

was only in al-Andalus that scholars of the
early Middle Ages had access to the entire corpus
of scientific knowledge of their time written In
Arabic, Hebrew, Greek or Latin.
To take one example of the transmission of
knowledge to Muslim Spain, Byzantine envoys
took there a copy of the Materia Medica, a well-
known treatise by the first-century-AD Greek
doctor DIoscorides. By comparing it with an
existing Arabic version, It was possible to fill in
many gaps, notably with regard to the precise
identification of plant species. This task was car-
ried out in collaboration with a monk named
Nicolas, who came from the East expressly for
the purpose.
In the same circle of scholars were the Jewish
minister and doctor Hasday ben Shaprut ; Ibn
Juljul, historian of medicine and pharmacology ;
and also perhaps the great surgeon Abu aI-Qasim
az-Zahrawi, known to Christians as Albucasis,
whose work was soon translated into Latin. He
wrote an outline of all the medical knowledge of
the day, providing descriptions of such diseases
as haemophilia and scabies, of various surgical
instruments, even of a way of using a particular
variety of ant to heal wounds.
Maslama al-Magriti's name also belongs on
the list. The works of this Madrid-based
astronomer and alchemist circulated In digest
form in Western Europe almost as soon as they
were written, thanks to Latin adaptations pre-
pared by the Mozarabic monks of the monastery
of Ripoll in Catalonia. From there they were dis-
patched to monasteries in the Rhine valley,
notably Saint Gall in Switzerland and Reichenau
in Germany.
In the tenth century the natural passage still
used by modern tourists travelling from central
Europe to Spain was the only means of commu-
nication beween the peninsula and the rest of the
continent. The route through the central and
western Pyrenees had been closed since the defeat
of Charlemagne at the battle of Roncevaux in
778.
The importance thus accorded to Catalonia
explains why the oldest surviving astrolabe, a
hybrid product of the Arab and Visigothic cul-
tures, is set to function at the latitude of Barcelona.38

### 90310: The Pursuit of learning

It was to the Catalan marches that the young Ger-
bert of Aurillac, later to become Pope Sylvester
II, travelled to study science. By the time he
returned to France, he had learned so much that
at first he was taken for a necromancer or magus.
It was some time before the new knowledge that
he helped to introduce to Europe-of such subjects
as decimal numbers, the abacus, the construction
of astrolabes, sun-dials, armillary spheres and
other instruments-became widely available there.
When he quit the Iberian peninsula, Gerbert
knew that he was leaving behind him not just a
land whose scientific culture was vastly superior
to that of Christendom but also one whose
researchers (if one can use that word to describe
tenth-century scholars) were making continued
progress in their respective fields. In order to keep
abreast of their work, Gerbert corresponded with
an acquaintance in Barcelona-one Lupitus,
recently identified as the archdeacon Sunifred-
whom he requested to send him the latest
writings from al-Andalus.
A fruitful partnership
In the same way, Christian envoys to Cordoba
such as Gomar, the future Bishop of Gerona,
profited from their residence in al-Andalus to co-
operate with their Muslim counterparts. Gomar
wrote a chronicle of the Frankish kings at the
request of the future caliph al-Hakam II al-
Mustansir. An edited version of this work was
soon circulating In the Orient, and it has come
down to us In the great Arab traveller and ency-
clopaedist al-Masudi's Murudj al-Dhahab.
The same ruler was also responsible for the
enlargement of the palace library, which eventu-
ally contained some 400, 000 volumes, only one
of which has survived. His bibliomania drove him
to pay a fortune for any book that caught his
interest. That is why the first copy of Abu al-.
Faradj'Ali al-Isfahani's " Book of Songs ", a col-
lection of poems set to music that contains much
information on social and cultural life during the
first centuries of Islam, was known in Cordoba
before it was In the Orient.
It has been established from the dates at which
some surviving works were imported that It was
possible for books to make the journey from the
Orient to Cordoba and then on into the Chris-
tian world in less than two years. The speed with
which knowledge was transmitted can be
explained by the close collaboration that existed
between scholars of different religions and cul-
tures. For instance the monk Recemundo, author
of a celebrated liturgical calendar, was successively
Andalusian envoy to the Holy Roman Empire,
to Constantinople and to Jerusalem. His work,
which was amalgamated into the oo o/ ! 
of Arib ben Sa'd, a doctor and civil servant who
was his contemporary, contains popularized ele-
ments of Indian and Iraqi astronomy as well as
a mention of the great astronomer aI-Battani.
The Christian writer Orosius's Seven 600
of Histories against the Pagans (Historiarum
< : c/Mg<tM (M Z. ! r : 77 was translated into
Arabic by two men, Qasim ben Asbagh, a
Muslim cadi or judge, and his Christian counter-
part, Walid ben Khayzuran. The treatise known
as the Mathematica Alhandrea probably had a
similar genesis. A series of brief texts In Latin,
it contains In more or less accurate form the
Arabic names of many stars, among them Rigel,
Betelgeuse, Altair, Vega and Aldebaran-
appellations that are still familiar today.
Other, more technical knowledge was also
propagated abroad. Maslama of Madrid, an
astrologer at the Umayyad court, adapted the
tables of aI-Kharezmi, the great Baghdad
mathematician, for the Cordoba meridian. He
also wrote notes on the construction of astrolabes
and carried out astronomical observations. His
work soon became known In Europe, though not
under his own name. Latin translations and
digests also helped many Arabic words, such as
al-sumt, azimuth, to enter other languages.
The new knowledge was also transmitted to
Europe via Arab prisoners of war held on Chris-
tian territory. Ibn Hayyan, the greatest historian
of al-Andalus, specifically refers to their influence.
Some of these captives were men of great
learning, and their captors knew how to profit
from their knowledge, t

### 90311: The Toledo school

TM MO   y MO ! M 
transmission 0 the 40-G cultural
legacy from alAndalus to Europe
i. T was not until the twelfth century that the
first college of translators from Arabic into Latin
was set up in Spain, in the city of Toledo. It was
founded by Don Raimundo, archbishop of
Toledo from 1126 to 1151. A Benedictine monk
who had been born at Agen in south-western
France, Raimundo was convinced of the impor-
tance of the Arab philosophers for an under-
standing of Aristotle, and he decided to make
their works available in Latin.
Domingo Gundisalvo, archdeacon of Segovia,
was one of the most eminent of the scholars
recruited by Raimundo. He translated much of
the encyclopaedic At al :/a' ("Book of
Healing ") by Ibn Sina (Avicenna) as well as al-
Ghazali's MM //M !/ ("The Aims of the
Philosophers ") and aI-Farabi's/M't !/- «/M
( " Catalogue of the Sciences ").
But Gundisalvo knew no Arabic. He used a
Jewish or Muslim intermediary to translate from
Arabic into Castilian, and then put the Castilian
into Latin. Among his Jewish collaborators two
names feature prominently : a certain Salomon
and, more importantly, one Johannes Avendeath
(who also appears as Avendear, Johannes ben
David, Johannes Hispanus, and also John of
Seville). The exact identity of these two has
aroused much discussion.
The most important of the Toledan trans-
lators was undoubtedly Gerard of Cremona
(1114-1187). Thanks to a brief notice left by his
pupils on his life and work, we know that Gerard
came to Toledo after finishing his studies in Italy,
in order to learn more about the 4/wMt. This

### 90311: The Toledo school

(Ptolemy), the celebrated second-century-AD
Greek astronomer, mathematician and
geographer, was then only available in Arabic.
In fact Gerard discovered a multitude of scien-
tific works in Arabic in Toledo, and immediately
began to learn the language so as to read them
and, later, to render them into Latin. He eventu-
ally translated more than seventy of them,
including the 4/gc, which he completed in
1175.
His translations cover virtually the entire
field of science of his time. Among them are
several treatises by Aristotle (The Physics, 0
Heaven ! M EA, 0 GccrfzoM J Co ?'y-
tion, and 7% c  ? 0), as well as books by al-
Kindi, Ptolemy, Isaac Israeli, Ibn SIna, Galen and
others.
The other great translator was Michael Scot
(c. ll75-c. l235). Born in England, he studied at
Oxford University and then in Paris before
settling in Toledo. After learning Arabic and
Hebrew, he became a prolific translator of Arabic
into Latin. Near the end of his life he was invited
to the court of the Emperor Frederick II in Sicily,
the other great centre of translation from the
Arabic.
Scot's translations included many commen-
taries on Aristotle by Ibn Rushd (Averroes) as
well as al-Bitruji's work on the spheres, which
was to have a great influence on astronomical
knowledge.
The Toledan translations raise problems of
attribution. The French writer and historian
Ernest Renan wrote in a study of Averroes : " It
is certain that the Latins who journeyed to
Toledo had no scruples about appropriating the
work of their secretaries, and... the name of
the translator was often a fiction.
" Nearly always a Jew, often a converted
Muslim, did a rough translation, substituting
words in Latin or the vernacular for the Arabic
original. A clerk would supervise this process,
taking responsibility for the final Latin version
and putting his name to the work. This explains
why one translation is often attributed to
different individuals. "
Renan's view was shared by the great
American medievalist Charles Homer Haskins in
his book on the twelfth-century Renaissance. It
is also supported by some translations in the Bib-
liotheque Nationale in Paris, which were ren-
dered from Arabic into Latin by way of Spanish.
The extraordinary achievements of the
Toledan translators were in reality the joint work
of Muslim Arabs, Jews and Latin Christians. It
would be unjust to give the credit exclusively to
the latter, even though many of the manuscripts,
and many historians, mention only their names.
Gundisalvo, Gerard of Cremona, Michael Scot
and others all called on the help of Muslim Arabs
or more often of Jews in the course of their work.
Sometimes the task of the Latin Christian trans-
lators was limited to putting into good Latin what
their assistants had already translated into bad
Latin or Spanish.
The great enterprise of translation from
Arabic into Latin began in Spain in the twelfth
century, and Toledo was its most active centre.
But it also took place in other cities of the penin-
sula including Barcelona, Tarragona, Segovia,
Leon and Pamplona. The task was subsequently
taken up on the other side of the Pyrenees, in
Toulouse, Beziers, Narbonne, Montpellier and
Marseilles.
It was thanks to these translations that
Europe came to know both the works of the
Greek philosophers, mathematicians, doctors and
astronomers and those of their Arabic commen-
tators or emulators. As Haskins wrote, " The
reception of this knowledge by western Europe
marks a crucial turning-point in the history of
European thought."t

### 90312: Borges in search of Averroës

A great Argentine
nr K) M/
attempt to recreate 
atmosphere of
intellectual life in
al Andalus
i. HE medica ! doctor, philosopher and jurist Ibn
Rushd or Averroes (1126-1198), the greatest Arab
commentator on Aristotle, is at home in Cor-
doba. He is busy writing a philosophical work,
the TM/Mt-/'TM/Kt (Destruction of Destruc-
tion) " in which it is maintained, contrary to the
Persian ascetic al-Ghazali, author of the TM/Kf-
M/-/M/fM/ (Destruction of Philosophers), that the
divinity knows only the general laws of the
universe, those pertaining to the species, not to
the individual.
" He wrote with slow sureness, from right to
left ; the effort of forming syllogisms and linking
vast paragraphs did not keep him from feeting,
like a state of well-being, the coot and deep house
surrounding him.
" In the depths of the siesta amorous doves
called huskily ; from some unseen patio arose the
murmur of a fountain ; something in Averroes,
whose ancestors came from the Arabian deserts,
was thankful for the constancy of the water.
" Down below were the gardens, the orchard ;
down below, the busy Guadalquivir and then the
beloved city of Cordoba, no less eminent than
Baghdad or Cairo, like a complex and delicate
instrument, and all around (this Averroes fett
also) stretched out to the limits of the earth the
Spanish land, where there are few things, but
where each seems to exist in a substantive and
eternal way."
The above passage is taken from Z, busca de
Averroes ("Averroes's Search", 1947), by the great
Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges (1899-1986).
Themes and figures of Arab-Islamic culture are
recurrent features of the work of Borges, who
once proclaimed that the Thousand and One
Mg/7h was the Book of Books. Of all the writings
he devoted to Arab-Islamic culture,"Averroes's
Search " best represents his special relationship
with that culture and, more particularly, with one
of its unique facets : the world of al-Andalus.
At-Andatus as depicted by Borges Is the scene
of an extraordinary spiritual adventure. It is a
place where commentaries are written on

of Alexander of Aphrodisia ". Where scholars
proudly examine rare manuscripts collected by
princes who are passionate bibliophiles. Where
questions of poetry and rhetoric are discussed
with fervour. Where an examination of the
authenticity of " marvels " can turn into a discus-
sion of the created or uncreated character of the
Qur'an.
Great intellectual receptivity, rich and con-
trasting characters, a profound respect for other
people's freedom of opinion, conversation and
the exchange of ideas raised to an art : these are
the characteristics of the Andalusian elite as
described by Borges. Averroes takes issue with
another character in the story, Farach the the-
ologian, by refusing to accept that " an excellent
variety of the perpetual rose... is found in the
gardens of Hindustan "-a Borgesian theme par
exce//eHcc-"whose petals, of a blood red, exhibit
characters which read :'There is no god but the
God, Muhammad is the Apostle of God.' " But
this disagreement does not provoke a polemic.
The viewpoint of the orthodox theologian, for
whom a miracle is the very sign of divinity, can
coexist with that of the rationalist.
In the person of Abulcasim the traveller
Borges mischievously presents a kind of antithesis
to the three other characters in the story-Farach
the theologian, Abdalmalik the poet and
Averroes himself. A down-to-earth, practical
man, Abulcasim, whose " memory was a mirror
of intimate cowardices, " has a very different
experience of the world from that of the men of
ideas and convictions. When asked to relate a
marvel, he reflects that " the moon of Bengal is
not the same as the moon of Yemen, but it may
be described in the same words. " A prudent man,
he never answers directly, but takes the pulse of
his audience and softens the asperities of the ques-
tions put to him by means of dialectical agility.
Could it be the memory of other, less tolerant
lands far from al-Andalus that explain this wari-
ness ? Was al-Andalus really the idyllic land Borges
describes ? Did it not, like any other country, have
its share of stupidity and horror as well as its
exemplary splendours ? The life of Averroes him-
self seems to confirm that this was so, if any proof
were needed. He knew opprobrium as well as
glory, suffered repression at the hands of obtuse
authorities, was present at the burning of books
that had cost him dear in hard work and self-
denial, and came to know not just the loyal sup-
port of true friends but also the stubborn hatred
of mediocrities.
But Borges's al-Andalus is not that of history,
nor that of a literary realism that would seek to
reconstitute objectively a life, a place, a time. He
does not set himself that goal, still less allow him-
self that illusion. The point of Borges's fiction is
quite different. The Spanish title of the story, La
busca <4fe'OM, can be read In two ways, as the
quest undertaken by Averroes himself, or as the
quest for Averroes-Borges's own attempt to
recreate the philosopher and his destiny in the
truest manner possible.
In the first paragraphs of the story, Averroes
is depicted hard at work in his library. He is grap-
pling with a problem that causes him great con-
cern. At the beginning of Aristotle's Poetics, on
which he is writing a commentary, he has stum-
bled over two words, tragedy and comedy. " No
one in the world of Islam could conjecture what
they meant. " He consults all the sources, pores
over the versions of the Nestorian Hunain ibn-
Ishaq and of Abu Bashar Mata. But in vain. And
yet " it was impossible to elude... these two
arcane words " from the great philosopher's
Poetics.
Borges twice puts Averroes in the presence
of the answer that he is seeking. The first occa-
sion is a scene in which he is distracted from his
work " by a kind of melody ", looks down from
his balcony and sees " below, in the narrow ear-
then patio, some half-naked children were

playing. One, standing on another's shoulders,
was obviously playing the part of a muezzin ; with
his eyes tightly closed, he chanted'There is no
god but the God.'The one who held him motion-
lessly played the part of the minaret ; another,
abject in the dust and on his knees, the part of
the faithful worshippers. The game did not last
long ; all wanted to be the muezzin.... "
The second time is through a story told by
the traveller Abulcasim about a strange thing he
had seen in China : " One afternoon, the Muslim
merchants of Sin Kalan took me to a house of
painted wood where many people lived. It is
impossible to describe the house, which was
rather a single room with rows of cabinets or bal-
conies on top of each other. In these cavities there
were people who were eating and drinking, and
also on the floor, and also on a terrace. The
persons on this terrace were playing the drum and
the lute, save for some fifteen or twenty (with
crimson-coloured masks) who were praying,
singing and conversing. They suffered prison, but
no one could see the jail ; they travelled on horse-
back, but no one could see the horse ; they fought,
but the swords were of reed ; they died and then
stood up again.
"'The acts of madmen,'said Farach,'exceed
the previsions of the sane.'
"'These were no madmen,'Abulcasim had
to explain.'They were representing a story, a
merchant told me.'
" No one understood, no one seemed to want
to understand....
"'Did these people speak ?' asked Farach.
"'Of course they spoke,'said Abulcasim..
..'They spoke and sang and perorated.'
"'In that case,'said Farach,'twenty persons
are unnecessary. One single speaker can teil any-
thing, no matter how complicated it might be.
, "
The words tragedy and comedy presuppose a
knowledge of theatre, an art unknown to Arab
culture In Averroes's day. The philosopher, a.
prisoner of his own culture, cannot imagine what
these words can mean unless he has some idea
of theatrical representation itself. This Is why,
when he has an example of it before his eyes-
the children playing at being muezzin-he cannot
see it. One can only see something of which one
already has a concept ; everything else remains
" invisible ". Since theatre does not exist as a cul-
tural category, another category that is familiar,
that of the story-teller, takes its place.
Averroes returns home at dawn and goes to
his library. Under the impression that he has
finally found the meaning of the two obscure
words, he adds these lines to his manuscript :
" Aristu (Aristotle) gives the name of tragedy to
panegyrics and that of comedy to satires and
anathemas. Admirable tragedies and comedies
abound In the pages of the Qur'an and in the
mohalacas of the sanctuary.... "
Borges then adds a postscript in which he
explains that in the story he has " tried to nar-
rate the process of a defeat ", the failure of a quest
blocked by Its own cultural frontiers, adding,
however, that his own quest for Averroes fails
for the same reason : " I felt that Averroes,
wanting to imagine what a drama is without ever
having suspected what a theatre is, was no more
absurd than I, wanting to imagine Averroes with
no other sources than a few fragments from
Renan, Lane and Asm Palacios. "
Can one ever really know another culture
than one's own ? Putting the bleakest possible
interpretation on Borges's words, it might be said
that cultures are closed to one another. If this is
the case, the quest for what al-Andalus was
becomes impossible, and attempts to recreate at-
Andalus are bound to give a distorted impression.
But such a quest also provides an ethical lesson :
to know is to be aware of otherness, of the " com-
pletely other", and to respect it-a very different
thing from the disastrous pretensions of the
" panoptic overview ".
" Few things more beautiful and more
pathetic are recorded In history than this Arab
physician's dedication to the thoughts of a man
separated from him by fourteen centuries,"
Borges says of Averroes.
Borges's story is a fine contemporary tribute
to the exceptional moment in intellectual life that
was al-Andalus. *

### 90314: Tenth anniversary of the UNESCO Prize for Peace Education

Tenth anniversary 
of the UNESCO Prize 
for Peace Education 
The UNESCO Prize for Peace Education was awarded for the first 
time ten years ago. The $60,000 prize, endowed by a gift from 
the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation, rewards outstanding 
activities designed “to construct the defences of peace in the minds 
of men" and is awarded annually at a ceremony at UNESCO head- 
quarters in Paris. The laureates are designated by the Director- 
General on the basis of a recommendation by an international jury 
of scholars and statespersons, which reviews the many nomina- 
tions which are sent from all over the world to UNESCO. 
In the past, education to “alert public opinion and mobilize the 
conscience of mankind in the cause of peace’ has not generally 
had the support and recognition it deserves and urgently requires. 
The prize has made and is making a notable change in that direc: 
tion. It is bringing to ever wider attention a message articulated 
as early as 1911 by one of the first two laureates, honoured in 
1981, The World Organization of the Scout Movement, “Peace 
cannot be secured . . . unless the spirit for peace is there in the 
minds and wills of the peoples. This is a matter of education.” 
Over the years the jury has selected a diverse group of 
laureates representing a very broad range of activities in peace edu- 
cation. We recently carried out a survey of the laureates which 
revealed that the prize has spurred greater efforts for peace. Helena 
Kekkonen of Finland (1981) reflected that “The reputation brought 
by the UNESCO prize did a lot towards increasing the interest of 
Finnish educators and people in general in peace education. . . . 
In 1985-1987, laws obliging ‘children and young people to be 
brought up with a will for peace’ came into effect in Finland." 
Several prize-winners reported becoming more active within 
UNESCO and the United Nations system. The International Peace 
Research Association, for example, has undertaken a project on 
“Cultural Symbiosis in al-Andalus” (see page 31). 
The funds awarded to the laureates have helped them to carry 
further their service to the advancement of peace education. Among 
the endeavours supported by the prize money have been: financing 
the travel of peace researchers from developing countries to par- 
ticipate in the 1990 biennial meeting of the International Peace 
Research Association; the funding of a work on peacekeeping that 
is used as a basic text for the professional preparation of military 
officers and diplomats; the promotion of a book on the struggles 
for peace of Egyptian and Israeli women; research on a just world 
order; a series of films on development and peace.

### 90313: The Topkapi harem: a forbidden enclave

c
SULTAN, seraglio, harem : such words long
epitomized Ottoman civilization in the
dreams of Westerners. The master of an
immense empire stretching from Egypt to
Persia and from Baghdad to Belgrade, the
sultan seemed to be a fabulous character who
enjoyed limitless power and endless pleasure.
It was easy to imagine him living in his harem
as if in a garden of earthly delights.
The reality was very different. The harem
was a restricted enclave governed by punc-
tilious protocol and strict rules, subject to the
authority of the / :  </f, the ruling
suttan's mother. In it love was codified, if not
ritualized. And if some sultans abused its
pleasures, others only went there for the sake
of custom ; and the majority only visited it in
moderation.
In the middle of the sixteenth century the
women of the sultan's eraslio moved into the

harem of the Topkapi. a new palace which was
to be the imperial residence until the
nineteenth century. Marvenousty situated on
a hi ! ! overtooking the Sea of Marmara, the
Bosphorus and the Golden Horn, the
immense complex covers 700, 000 square
metres, with its vast gardens, its murmuring
waters and its terraces overlooking the sea. At
its heart was the harem, where only the sultan
had the right to enter and move around freely.
This forbidden domain adjoined the bar-
racks of the haiberdiers-with-tresses, tough
mountain troops from Anatolia who cut the
wood that fue ! ted the palace fires. To avoid
temptation, these soldiers wore high collars
that made it impossible for them to turn their
heads, and their long, braided locks served as
blinkers.
As time passed, the harem grew, spreading

central core. There are more than 400 rooms
in its three precincts : the living quarters of the
black eunuchs ; the women's quarters, where
the apartments of the suttan's mother,
daughters and odalisques were situated ; and
the men's apartments, where the sultan and
the princes of the b) ood hved.
One enters the harem through a gate
leading into the Domed Hall with Cabinets,
where merchants deposited jewellery, furs and
clothing for the concubines. The living quarters
of the black eunuchs, which have a courtyard
decorated with btue, green and turquoise cer-
amic tiles, are three storeys high. The size and
decoration of the apartments and the baths
varied according to the eunuchs'rank.
At the entrance to the women's quarters,
an inscription on the bronze door recalls the
suttan's overeignty. This is a world where the
play of tight, the splendour of the ancient
tiling and the refinement of the decoration
combine to produce an impression of paradise
on earth. In these apartments with their rich
hangings, luxurious carpets and deep divans,
it is easy to imagine the beautiful kadins (the
sultan's principal consorts, officially recog-
nized as such though not married to him)
waiting bejewelled for their master.
The way to the apartments of the valide
sultan ties through a courtyard, decorated with
twenty-five marble columns. From a small
wooden belvedere situated nearby, it was pos-
sible to survey all the activities of the harem.
These palatial quarters comprise a series
of rooms in the Western style, with
monumental chimneypieces, mirrors and areas
of wait decorated with paintings. In the
bedroom are panels painted with imaginary
landscapes, a baldaquin of gilded wood, and
divans with shimmering fabric. An arched
doorway leads to the queen mother's private
prayer room.
The queen mother's baths are arranged in
the same way as those of her son. The first
room was for undressing, white sipping drinks
or sherbets ; in the second cold water was
provided ; hot water in the third. The basins
and tubs were of alabaster.
The suttan's private apartments consist of
four great rooms, the most beautiful and the
best preserved of the harem. In the Imperial
Halt, a dais with marble columns and a balus-
trade of gilded wood encrusted with mother-
of-peart was used by mate musicians and
singing girls. The sultan's throne, surmounted
by a baldaquin, stood on a peart carpet which
had been embroidered in the harem. On his
visits to the harem this was where he gave the
receptions that no one from the city or even
the palace could attend, where the women
danced, played music and recited poems.
The vast Privy Chamber of Murad III,
which was built by the great architect Sinan,
displays all the splendour and nobility of tate-
sixteenth-century Ottoman art. Its beautifully
worked dome is supported by four arches. The
decoration ofthe walls is handled in such a way
as to present a subtle gradation of colours and
tight, from lower panels coated with a unique
red varnish (the secret of their manufacture
perished with the Iznik craftsman who made
them) to stained-glass windows above. A foun-
tain decorated with stone flowers and a huge
gilded hearth are set opposite one another.

Harem, and the incessant murmur of water,
it is said, served to muffle the voice of the
prince during his secret conversations....
Beneath the Privy Chamber, the women
disported themselves in a marble swimming-
pool, opening on one side onto a second, out-
door pool.
Other rooms still wait to be visited : the
apartment of the crown prince, where gold,
mother-of-pear ! and ivory are fabulously min-
gled ; the so-cailed Meeting Place of the Jinns,
a narrow corridor that was nonetheless an
important artery of the harem In which many
a conspiracy was hatched ; the Golden Way,
the passage the sultan used to go to religious
cetebrations. It is said that when a new sultan
ascended the throne, he would throw golden
coins at all the women of the harem lined up
along these walls.
Leaving the harem by the Aviary Gate is
like waking from a dream. The harem is
unlike any other palace. It is an unreal resi-
dence, a paradise that enchants by its refine-
ment but chills by its prisonlike aspect.
Iron rules
The harem has been the theatre of many dra-
matic events, but Its inflexible laws remained
the same for four centuries.
All the women of the harem were bought
and became slaves of the sultan. They were
magnificent girls, recruited from among the
captives of conquered lands. The age of entry
ranged from five to sixteen. In the intrigue-
filled chambers of the court, it was beauty, not
The feadin mom of Ahmad
birth, that could win advancement by
attracting the sultan's eye. Most of the girls
were destined to remain servants, but those
picked out by the harem superintendent, a
woman known as the kaya kadin, received a
thorough education, so they might please the
ruler.
Life in the harem was punctuated by the
festivities held to celebrate births and mar-
riages. Normally girls who failed to attract the
sultan were freed at the age of twenty-five,
when they received a pension for life and were
given in marriage to a member of the court
or the clergy.
It is hard to say exactly how many women
lived in the harem. Ottoman sources ay 700,
which would seem to be a maximum in view
of the space alloted them. A document dating
from the beginning of the seventeenth century
puts the figure at 456.
In the harem, the word of the valide sultan
was law. Through weakness or incapacity,
some sultans even allowed their mother to
govern in their place. She alone possessed
sumptuously decorated apartments and a civil
and a military household. Even more signifi-
cantly, her apartments were the only ones that
had access to the sultan's private chambers.
The custom of employing eunuchs to
guard the palace women was a very ancient
one. Orieinatine in Mesopotamia, it spread
around the world, from China to Rome. The
Ottoman harem was no exception to the rule.
The black eunuchs who had charge of it from
the end of the sixteenth century retained their
power and influence until the end of the
imperial period.
The eunuchs, who came from Africa,
especially Ethiopia, were subjected to an iron
discipline. Their most important tasks
included preventing outsiders from entering
the harem and stopping the women from
absconding. They received a training com-
parable to that given to the royal pages ; they
lost their own names, being given those of
flowers instead, and were taught music and cal-
ligraphy. Their commander was the third
highest officer of the empire.
A fragile jewel
In order to draw the attention of the interna-
tional community to the wonders of the Tur-
kish patrimony, the Director-General of
UNESCO launched an appea) in 1983 for the
protection of the historic quarter of Istanbul
and other sites. One of the priorities was the
restoration and rehabilitation of the Topkapi
Palace.
In the nineteenth century, the sultan
moved to the palace of Dolmabahce and Top-
kapi was abandoned to the surveillance of a
few guards. The building suffered substantial
damage : there was a fire in 1863 and an earth-
quake in 1894, white in 1871 some buildings
were demolished to make way for a railway
line. After the proclamation of the republic,
the palace was transformed into a museum,
but only part of the complex was placed under
the control of the its directors.
The harem is, naturally, one of the ; ewets
of the palace ; its architecture is an exceptional
memorial to the richness and diversity of
Ottoman civilization. Its reputation has con-
tinued to grow. Projects, excavations and
investigations have multiplied ; more than 400
studies of it have been published.
Built as it is of wood, it is particularly vut-
nerable to the risk of fire, and the first pri-
ority is an efficient system of alarms and extin-
guishers. Restoring the building is no easy
task, for, as with any monument, its architec-
tural features need to be respected, both inside
and out. That means using the original
materials, including ivory, ebony, teak and
go) d) eaf, ai ! hard to come by these days. In
spite of the precautions taken to protect it
from unfavourable weather conditions, the
edifice is rapidly ageing and considerable main-
tenance and repair work is needed. N

### 90315: Yunus Emre: anniversary

T
1 His year we celebrate the 750th anniver-
sary of the birth of Yunus Emre, who was
probably the most significant foik poet in the
history of Islamic literature, besides being the
most important Turkish poet up to the twen-
tieth century. His poetry embodies the quin-
tessence of Turkish-Anatolian Islamic
humanism and has been a source of inspira-
tion in Turkish intellectual life through the
ages. His verses include eloquent specimens of
tolerance and universalism :
Mystic is what they call me,
Hate is my only enemy.
I harbour a grudge against none.
To me the whole wide world is one.
Many of Yunus Emre's fundamental con-
cepts are rooted in the Sufi tradition, particu-
larly as exemplified by the thirteenth-century
mystic and poet Rumi, who lived in Anatolia
but wrote in Persian. In this Rumi resembled
the writers and thinkers of medieval Europe
who used Latin in preference to their national
languages. But Yunus Emre, like Dante,
adopted the vernacular of his own people.
Because he spoke their language and brought
a message of divine love, he became a legen-
dary figure and came to be regarded as a saint.
For seven centuries his verses have been
memorized, recited and celebrated in the
heartland of Anatolia. Even today most Turks
can read and appreciate him without too much
recourse to the dictionary, while they find
many classical poets of the fourteenth to
nineteenth centuries quite unintelligible.
But it is not for reasons of language alone
that Yunus Emre appeals to us today. His
themes and concerns are both timeless and
universal, relevant to not only to Turkey but
to the whole world, and as much now as ever
before. For we live in an age that sees war as
evil and the supreme crime against humanity.
Love is the celebration of life, an idea which
is forcefully expressed in the catchword from
the 1960s and 1970s : " Make love, not war ".
Translated into mystical terms, this means that
it has both a human and a divine dimension,
and it is here that we catch an echo from the
poetry of Yunus Emre :
Portrait of Yunus Emre
by the contemporary Turkish artist
Siiheyl Unver.
1am not here on earth for strife.
Love is the mission of my life.
It is a poetry that speaks to us through the
centuries, expressing the ecstasy of com-
munion with nature and union with God.
This theme of union with God frequently
appears in his writing as an ideal which is
about to be realized, while his humanism
includes, in Hegel's words, the " urging of the
spirit outward-that desire on the part of man
to become acquainted with his world".
Yunus Emre spurned book learning if it
did not have a humanistic relevance, because
he believed in man's godliness. In this sense
he had affinities with Petrarch, also writing
in the fourteenth century, and with Erasmus,
a century later, who, as part of their classical
or Renaissance humanism, shunned the dog-
matism imposed on man by scholasticism.
Like them, he sought to instil in ordinary
people a renewed sense of the importance of
life on Earth, but like Dante, he explored the
ethical dimension of mortal life while
depicting the higher values of immortal being.
Yunus Emre's lines are memorable :
Whoever has one drop of love
Possesses God's existence.
About Yunus Emre's life we know very
little, and what we do know tends to be a
matter of legend rather than ascertainable fact.
He is said to have been illiterate for most if
not all of his life, yet the poems display an eru-
dition and a richness of allusion that could
hardly be expected from an illiterate. In any
case, it is the poems themselves that count, and
some of them are magnificent.
Yunus Emre's poetry is dominated by a
unitary vision of man and nature. Through his
humanism he seeks to enrich human existence
and to ennoble it by liberating man from
dogma nd by placing him in a relationship of
love with God. His view of love is creative and
non-exciusive : " In God's world there are a
hundred thousand kinds of love ", and " When
love arrives, all needs and flaws are gone. " He
was concerned about all people, particularly the
deprived, and this is what gives his poetry its
intensely moving quality. He was the first poet
in Turkish history to create an " aesthetics of
ethics ", and in this he has never been surpassed.
He stressed the ecumenical ideal :
We regard no one's religion as contrary to ours.
True love isborn when all faiths are united.
Much of his work is a testament to the
equality of all human beings. In an age marked
by conflict and destruction, Yunus Emre gave
voice to an aft-embracing love, proclaiming a
belief in a universal fellowship that transcends
all schisms and sects :
The world is my true ration
Its people are my nation.
He was a man of the people and for the
people-a spokesman for social justice who
spoke out courageously against the oppression
of the underprivileged by rulers, landowners,
officials and religious leaders. He thus stood
in the mainstream of a humanist tradition that
has always claimed the moral right to criticize
the Establishment and the powers that be.
And, in what could be seen as an anticipation
of the spirit of the United Nations and
UNESCO, he made a poetic plea for world
peace and fellowship which is still supremely
relevant in today's world, convulsed as it is
by violence and war :
Come let us all be friends for once
Let us make life easy on us
Let us love and let us be loved ones
The world shall be left to no one. N
