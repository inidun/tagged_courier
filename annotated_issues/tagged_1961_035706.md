100%
A LITTLE SAFETY
PREVENTS A BIG
ACCIDENT
Accidents are the world's third worst killer. While medical
science makes great progress in combating disease and
illness, the mounting toll from accidents shows no signs of
decreasing. With this in mind, the World Health Organi¬
zation has chosen as a theme for World Health Day, April 7,
1961, "Accidents and their Prevention." In this issue The
Unesco Courier presents a series of articles dealing with this
important subject. The questionnaire below will test your
resistance to the seven main kinds of accidents shown on
the graph at the right. Answer the questions yes or no as
honestly as you can. There can be no half-and-half responses.
The difference between yes and no in accident prevention
may sometimes be the difference between life and death.
QDo you use safety matches in the kitchen, stored in a metal
container?
£% Have your furnace, chimney, stoves and flues been cleaned
during the past year?
f% Do you keep poisons and harmful drugs stored apart from
everyday toiletries?
#fe Is your shower or bathtub provided with handrail and rubber
vmat?

### 78182: Accidents: world's third worst killer

ACCIDENTS
WORLD'S THIRD
WORST KILLER
by Dr. M. G. CANDAU
WORLD HEALTH DAY APRIL 7
Director-General,
World Health Organization
In the world today, accidents cause more deaths than
any single illness except cancer and cardiovascular
disease. (See graphs below.) In many countries accidents
kill more children from 5 to 19 than all other causes
combined. They take a greater toll in young lives than
any war the world has yet known. Yet accidents have
been less studied than has any fatal disease of equal gra¬
vity. It is only recently that scientific research on this
subject has been undertaken.
Too many people still unthinkingly accept accidents as
misfortunes over which the individual has no control.
"Accidents will happen", they say, as if that excused
everything. Yet whenever studies are made of accidents
in home or school, on the road, in factory or farm, or
of any other sort of accident, ways can always be found
to reduce their number and seriousness. Accidents are
not chance events, they do not just "happen". Every
one of them is the outcome of a chain of causes and most
of them can be prevented.
There is evidence that the majority of accidents happen
in situations which are generally thought to be "safe".
About half of all accidents happen in the home, and
children are the principal victims. Two-fifths of all fatal
accidents to children between one and four years of age
take place in or around the home. Prominent causes are
burns and poisoning which, even if not fatal, are generally
serious. Yet almost all these accidents could be avoided
by a little extra vigilance and a few simple precautions.
A thousand people a day die on the world's roads half
of all accident deaths. Road accidents are the most
talked-about and most written-about of all, yet little Is
really known of the multiple factors which interact to
produce them.
Occupational accidents have been more thoroughly
studied than any others, and in many industries strict
safety regulations are enforced. Notwithstanding this, in
the United States of America alone it is estimated that
in 1959, the working time lost because of accidents was
220 million man-days.
Here then is one of mankind's greatest scourges. Yet
in our era of scientific progress, we have scarcely begun
to think about combating it.
Accidents have more in common with diseases than the
simple fact that both can be deadly. The epidemiological
methods used to study the distribution of disease can use¬
fully be applied to them, but uniform methods of accident
reporting must first be adopted. It will then become
possible to define the situations in which they are likely
to occur, in the same way as for the etiology of diseases.
It is not suggested that such research is easy, but it can
and must be carried much further than at present.
In the meantime there is still much that can be done.
Most countries already have a safety code for road users;
they have legislation intended to reduce occupational
accidents and also, in some cases, regulations concerning
the safety of home appliances, electric fittings, and so on
The best present hope of accident prevention Is cer¬
tainly through safety education. Innumerable accidents
are due, at least in part, to some action or omission of the
victim himself- -the pedestrian who crosses the road
without looking; the boy who tries to change a fuse
without turning off the current; the workman who falls
to observe the factory's safety rules. Safety should, of
course, be taught in schools, but also in factories, on the
farm, and, perhaps most important of all, in the home
In economically developed countries some progress has
now been made. But what of those countries in the
process of rapid industrialization, which do not yet have
any statistics to guide them, where legislation is insuffi¬
cient or not enforced, and where the idea that anything
at all can be done to prevent accidents Is accepted only
by the few? To them I would say: Face up to this situa¬
tion and act quickly, avoid the bitter mistakes made In
those countries where industrialization began over a cen¬
tury ago, and profit from their experience.
On World Health Day 1961, I would urge all peoples,
whatever their stage of economic progress, to open their
eyes to the plain fact that accidents have now become
a leading cause of death, disablement and economic loss,
and to realize, once and for all, accidents need not happen

### 63835: Where risks are greatest: accidents in the home

ACCIDENTS IN THE HOME
WHERE RISKS ARE GREATEST
BHE kitchen, the stairs or the bedroom of a modern
house hold more dangers than the fastest car or
plane, the steepest mountain, or a ship In a storm.
Simple things like a tube of aspirin left lying on
a table, a kettle of boiling water, a forgotten edge tool,
will make more cripples and kill more children this year
than will poliomyelitis and tuberculosis together.
Perhaps it is because the dangers are so commonplace
that accidents In the home seem hard to avoid. Even
the absent-minded or reckless will look before crossing
a road; even the most prudent will unthinkingly run
across a polished floor to answer the 'phone.
Take Mrs. Ruth Galley, 75 years old, living alone In
her room In Lewlsham, England. She Is in perfect health,
yet every day for years she has risked a fatal accident.
Like many English houses, hers has a coin-ln-the-slot
gas meter. For some mysterious reason, the meter Is
so fixed that she has to climb on a chair to put in
the shilling. There she was one day when a health visitor
called. A telephone call to the gas company, and the next
day, Mrs. Galley's meter was fixed where she could reach
It easily. At the same time, the rubber pipe of her gas
cooker, which was just as old and even more fragile than
Its owner, was replaced. All free of charge of course.
So her name will probably not be among thr 4,500 or
so persons above the age of 65 who die every year In
Great Britain as the result of a fall or among the 1,500
Beware of
leaving irons
and other heavy

lying about
persons who die as the result of poisoning by gas or other
substance.
In the United States of America, there were nearly four
million home accidents In 1959, whereas the total of road
and Industrial accidents for the same period was reckon¬
ed to be only 3,350,000. If we take Into consideration the
2.000.000 victims of accidents occurring outside their
homes but not at work, or in automobiles, it would seem
that twice as many people are hurt In the United States
during occupations that are commonly supposed to be
more or less safe than at their Jobs or In traffic. It Is
true that proportionally as well as In absolute numbers,
there are more deaths In Industrial and traffic accidents
(50.000 In the United States of America in 1959); yet
there were no fewer than 43,500 deaths In accidents of
other kinds, of which 26,000 occurred In homes.
A survey made In 1955 In Stockholm showed that of
the Swedish capital's 227,000 children, 24,466 had had acci¬
dents oí which 29 were fatal; I.e. a proportion of one fatal
accident to 340 less serious ones. Previously it was esti¬
mated In Sweden that there were between 100 and 400
less serious accidents for every fatal accident. And
Sxeden has one of the world's lowest accident rates.
Safety of the home Is a question of at least national
tí«T.en3lons. In the view of the Royal Society for the
Prevention of Accidents, whose home safety department
extends Its activities throughout the United Kingdom.
The people whom it Is Important to reach are those who
are naturally careless. It Is usually the very poor who
need help most those who do not go to safety meetings
organized by the 135 local home safety committees In
Great Britain. They neither read the pamphlets nor see
the films nor visit the exhibitions. These potential victims
of accidents must be sought out In their own homes. A
neighbourly visit by a member of the local home safety

committee or an inspection of the gas and electricity
Installations will do more good than all the public lectures
In the world.
Door-to-door visiting Is not always enough however.
Some problems require a more massive attack on old in¬
grained habits. In 1958, for example, the Royal Society
for the Prevention of Accidents with backing from the
Home Office launched a nation-wide campaign to provide
all open fireplaces with safety screens In order to bring
down the number of serious burns, which over the years
had been remaining fairly constant.
Similar campaigns could well have been launched In
many other countries, for a bad burn is one of the most
horrible accidents. The pain suffered by the victim,
whether burnt by fire, acid, boiling water or steam, Is
only the beginning. Then comes treatment lasting on
an average from one to three months, while subsequent
operations and grafts are sometimes spread over several
years. Furthermore any permanent Infirmity or mutila¬
tion may lead to psychological consequences, the serious--
ness of which Is only now beginning to be realized.
Every year, five to ten times as many children as adults

suffer burns. In Great Britain, only 700 persons die of
burns every year, but 550 hospital beds are permanently
occupied by the victims of burns, and 126,000 persons
alive today have at some time been In hospital for the
one single reason that their clothes caught fire.
The problem is even more severe in some of the rapidly-
developing countries because of the widespread use of
gas and explosive substances (acetylene, butane or pro-

pane lamps, fireworks, etc.). Everywhere, boiling liquids
claim Innumerable victims.
After the children, it is the elderly who most frequently
suffer these terrible accidents. Indeed the number of
fatal burns is even higher among the old than among the
young. In Great Britain, victims of burns over the age of
65 are three or four times as numerous as those among
young adults. Twice as many women as men suffer burns
from clothing that caught fire: dresses, skirts and night¬
gowns, particularly when made of cotton, are much more
likely to catch fire than men's clothing.
In Great Britain today, a highly developed system of
rules and regulations provides some guarantee of safety.
Every heating appliance electric, gas, oil or other has
to meet certain well-defined standards of safety, and it
is against the law to expose a child to an insufficiently
protected fire.
Dr Leonard Colebrook, who is one of the pioneers of the
prevention of burns, In England, considers, however, that
this Is not enough. He has expressed surprise that certain
highly flammable textiles have been put on sale without
the public being warned of their potential danger; for
the quicker the material burns, the worse the damage.
Says Dr Colebrook, "If we want to fight effectively, we
should collect maximum Information on the most flam¬
mable textiles, reach international agreement on ways of
Indicating the degree of flammabllity of each textile and
the rapidity with which It burns, and get the safest tex¬
tiles used for children's and old people's clothing."
Dr Joan Woodward, a psychiatrist attached to the Burns
Research Unit In Birmingham, England, considers that
after the accident has happened no effort should be
!
The proper way
to lift pans
is with
a potholder
spared to soothe the anxiety and guilt feelings of the
parents. She recently examined 200 children that had
had severe burns two to five years previously. Accord¬
ing to their mothers, 80 per cent of the children still
suffered emotionally from the effects.
But during her survey, Dr Woodward was to realize that
many of the mothers suffered In this respect at least as
much as their children. "They all without exception feel
guilty and ashamed," she says. "Many mothers read In
the newspapers about accidents caused by fire. But they
cannot believe that such a thing could happen in their
own family."
It cannot be said too often: watch that fire, careful
with that boiling water. And an absolute rule for baby's
bath: always put the cold water in first before the hot
water. If possible, do not have children around the
kitchen when the meal is being cooked. The handles of
pots and pans on the stove should not point outwards.
Do young girls really have to wear nightdresses? A pair
of pyjamas, which catch fire much less easily, may mean
the difference between life and death. Spot removers,
floor polish, paraffin oil or petrol should be kept in a
safe place and in small quantities only. Such simple pre¬
cautions can save life and prevent ruined lives.
This Is even more obvious when one comes to another
great class of home accidents: poisoning. Again it Is the
children and to a lesser degree the old people who are
the main victims. Unlike other home accidents, poisonings
generally Increase in number with a rise in the standard
of living. Enforcing strict regulations concerning the
description and packing of poisonous substances Is one
obvious way of helping to prevent poisonings in the home.
But even here much remains to be done. International
standards are urgently necessary In the description and
labelling of poisons, whether they be medicines, cleaning
fluids, insecticides or other dangerous chemicals. Paint
used inside the house should be free of lead, as should
all toys. This already is a law In a number of countries.
A country policeman in southern Sweden recently In¬
vented a special kind of latch for closing a cupboard.
To release It, two separate movements are required. All
the tests have shown that this Is too difficult for a child
under four. The device Is quite Inexpensive and has ad-
Bo sure your

vantages over the key that so often gets lost, or that
people sometimes, perhaps on the fatal occasion, forget
to turn in the lock.
Working along similar lines, a young pediatrician has
invented a stopper for a bottle that simply goes on turn¬
ing round with a cllckety-click noise when a child tries
to open it, and an aspirin tube made of plastic which
has to be squeezed slightly before a tablet will come out.
These two Inventions stood up very well to tests with
children.
It is necessary to know which products to keep out of
children's reach. Who thinks of locking up cosmetics and
perfumes? Barbiturates and the family pharmacy in
general should be carefully tidied away where they are
inaccessible to a child. The same is true of polish and
cleaning products. On no account should toxic substances
such as paraffin oil, petrol or acids be kept in containers
originally intended for other purposeslemonade bottles,
jam jars, etc.
Falls, burns and poisonings are not the only risks that
must be guarded against. The greatest enemy of family
safety, and one from which the others stem. Is negligence,

with its corollaries, untidiness and dirt. A badly-lit room
may cost much more than would a brighter lamp. A prop¬

"details" such as these that the life of a child may
depend.
Turn off the mains switch before mending a fuse, wipe
up Immediately a spot of grease fallen on to the kitchen
floor, leave the window ajar in a room where a gas or
coal stove Is alight attention to these seeming trivialities
will transform a house Into a true home where a family
can live in security Instead of In constant danger.

This little boy, a victim of drown¬

ancient method, once abandoned
and now considered by the Red
Cross and the World Health Or¬

usual push-pull methods. The
boy is placed on his back and

### 63837: The Dangerous world of childhood

THE DANGEROUS WORLD
OF CHILDHOOD
Dangers surround a child from the moment it draws
Its first breath. The whole of human life Is Indeed,
in a sense, an unceasing struggle against danger.
During his first year, a child Is Incapable of judgment.
Unable to move or to do anything for himself, he depends
entirely on his mother, who has to think and act for him,
and protect him against all the dangers to which he Is
exposed.
There is one particular danger against which the
mother must be constantly on guard suffocation. The
first precaution Is to make sure that within the baby's
reach there is nothing that might interfere with his
breathing. Eiderdown pillows should be banished.
In recent years, a new danger has appeared in the
shape of plastic curtains, trimmings, etc. Static electri¬
city may cause this filmy substance to cling tightly to
the face of a new-born child, blocking Its nose and mouth
and suffocating It rapidly. In the United States, plastic
bags bear a notice drawing attention to this danger and
warning parents to keep them out of baby's reach.
Food Is the second great cause of suffocation. Even an
overworked mother should realize that she Is running
a terrible risk if she leaves her baby alone to suck his
bottle. Thirdly, far too many mothers appear not to
know how easy it is to stifle a baby sleeping In the same
bed with them.
While a mother should always protect her child
against danger during the first months of his
life, It Is very Important for her to start letting
him fend for himself when he' Is about one year old.
Little by little, she should lose the habit of doing things
for him, of fussing over him. A mother who Is over-
worried and over-careful Is perhaps the child's greatest
danger; for the moment he escapes her supervision as of
course he will sooner or later he Is likely to assert his
freedom by some forbidden and perhaps fatal action.
One precaution against this Instinct for self-assertion
Is to make the child's environment as safe as possible.
But passive protection Is not enough: It Is necessary for
the child to learn to understand the risks he runs. Adults
frequently make one of two mistakes: either they credit
the child with more intelligence than he possesses, or
they assume he Is quite unable to think for himself. In
both cases they fail to understand that they are dealing
with a mind and a body In constant development.
Between 12 and 15 months, the child is absorbed In
examining the world around him. He will explore the
house. He will try to touch everything he comes across,
particularly if it is on a level with his eyes. Almost every¬
thing he will try to put in his mouth. Around two, he
becomes capable of opening a door. He likes to lift up a
lid and empty a box, only to fill it up again afterwards.
He has little Idea of distance and tries to climb here,
there and everywhere. To play with water becomes a
favourite pastime. At about three, he Is surer of his
movements and likes to go walking. He learns to dis¬
tinguish right and left. He enjoys feeling responsible and
making himself useful. At the age of four or so, he
thinks of nothing but running about and playing ball.
He can ride a tricycle and climb trees. He can concen¬
trate mentally for longer periods.
Should all this exploration and these Increasingly dan¬
gerous activities by prohibited? "No," says Monsieur
Robert Sallé, head of the education and publicity section
of the French Institut National de Sécurité. "You cannot
base accident prevention on the principal of taking no
risks. In life you get nowhere If you don't take risks."
Safety education should accordingly be pursued along
two lines: teach the child to distinguish between the risks
he may take and those he had better avoid; teach him the
best way of dealing with dangers that cannot be avoided.
If parents are to provide their children with a judicious
blend of advice, reprimand and prohibition, they must
learn to know their children better. They should
for Instance admit once and for all that, as the stati¬
stics show, boys are more liable to have accidents than
girls. Not as an excuse for resignation or inaction but
as a guide to where preventive efforts should be used.
An important factor in accidents Is the time of day.
The survey carried out In 1955 in Stockholm by the
Swedish Committee for the Prevention of Accidents in
Childhood showed that a large number of accidents oc¬
curred between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m., with a slight in¬
crease from 11 a.m. to midday and a very marked increase
between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. In Stockholm, these arc the
hours immediately preceding the midday and evening
meals, and are probably also those during which children
are less well supervised. Hunger and fatigue, particularly
towards evening, make the children more accident-prone.
Similarly In France It was noted by Dr Gravel that under
the age of 15, most accidents occur around 5 p.m.
The time of year also plays a part. According to
Dr Barbara J. van den Berg, summer is the season In
which most of the accidents among children between
the ages of 1 and 14 occur In the Netherlands.
A pilot study carried out in the United States of Am¬
erica on children who repeatedly suffered accidents
revealed a number of psychological factors. It was
found that hostility to the environment, a conflict with
the parents, or simply a state of tension within the family
may create a predisposition to accidents. Also that a
child who strains his powers in order to gain acceptance
by a group of older children may take dangerous risks.
In different regions, children are exposed to different
dangers. In Scandinavia and in the Netherlands, drown¬
ing is the most frequent cause of accidental death among
children of pre-school age. Among home accidents in
Great Britain, burns are second only to suffocation.

### 63837: The Dangerous world of childhood

THE DANGEROUS WORLD OF CHILDHOOD (Cont'd)
In all countries where motor traffic Is intense, it Is
responsible, perhaps not for the most frequent, but cer¬
tainly for the most serious accidents. In Sweden, 40 per
cent, of childhood accidents occur in or around the home
and only 10 per cent, occur In traffic; but 34 per cent,
of accidental deaths among children are due to traffic.
In the Netherlands, among children of pre-school age
who are hurt In a traffic accident, most are on foot.
It has often been said that the education of the children
starts with the education of the parents. This Is especial¬
ly true In matters of safety. "If I had only known. . ."
says the mother in despair after her child has been
crippled or killed In a traffic accident. Why did she not
know that a child under five should never be allowed
to venture alone on the road?
She should have known that there are a number of
simple things a four-year-old can be taught. The great
thing In road safety for children Is to get them to stop
and think. According to British experts a "Kerb Drill"
to teach children how to cross a street has already saved
thousands of lives in the United Kingdom during these
last 30 years. As the British drive on the left of the
road, the drill goes like this:
"At the kerb, HALTl
Look to the Right, Look to the Left,
Look to the Right again,
If all clear, Quick March."
It would, of course, need adaptation in countries where
traffic moves on the right.
According to Monsieur Robert Sallé of the French Insti¬
tut National de Sécurité, safety education must not be
based on fear:
"We all know what a deep Impression terror stories
can make on the young mind. The child Is prepared to
accept them as real, even If the stories speak only of ima¬
ginary dangers. We also know that childhood terrors
may make a lifelong Impression, even though, during ado¬
lescence and later, efforts may be made to overcome the
bad effects. This being so, -it would be just as stupid to
frighten a child with real dangers as with Imaginary ones.
What Is needed is to get the child to acquire habits of
simple self-defence."
Safety education must therefore be considered part of
general education and should certainly be included In
the school curriculum. It Is also an essential part of
that "savoir vivre" that the child acquires mainly from
his parents.
The motorist or the cyclist driving in town traffic must
have his eyes everywhere, right, left, in front, and behind.
This kind of attention is exactly that of an animal, or
a man for that matter, moving through a probably hostile
forest. Schooling on the other hand tends to develop
concentrated attention. A strong case can be made out
for training this diffuse kind of attention and one of
the best ways of doing so is probably through team games
and sports.
Sport Indulged in reasonably may help young people
to avoid traffic accidents, not only because it sharpens
reflexes, but because it accustoms to the observance of
rules, and encourages a well-balanced way of life, healthy
food habits, and moderation in drinking. The best way
of substantially reducing the number of drowning acci¬
dents is to teach swimming at school.
As regards falls, an analysis of Industrial and home
accidents shows the usefulness of distinguishing two
kinds: falls on the level and falls from a height. The
large number of falls in all human activities and the sta¬
tistical predominance of falls on the level suggest that
one remedy might be to give young people the right kind
of physical training perhaps Including elementary judo
(Japanese wrestling) and simple acrobatic exercises on
the ground.
Accidents are fewer following any efforts to make
children realize the risks they are running and to teach
them how to meet the dangers they encounter.
Education offers the only hope of, little by little, over¬
coming this great malady of our times without detriment
to courage, initiative, and other human values.

### 63840: Whose fault is it? Why do car accidents happen?

WHY DO CAR ACCIDENTS HAPPEN?
WHOSE
Every ninety seconds on the average, a man, woman
or child is killed outright or fatally Injured on the
world's roads. The mishaps in which these 1,000
people die each day represent one-third of accident
deaths of all kinds. Everyone talks about road accidents
and deplores their ever-mounting toll, yet relatively little
Is really known about the multiple factors which Interact
to produce the most common cause of accidental death
In the twentieth century.
Some statistics tend to Incriminate drivers. Nine out
of ten accidents are the driver's own fault, they say, and
only one In ten Is due to defects In the automobile or
the road. The logical conclusion is that the driver Is to
blame for nearly 100% of all mishaps.
The truth Is much less simple. Though any traffic
accident depends on three main factors the driver, his
vehicle and the road all are involved in varying degrees,
and other factors have also to be taken into account.
How all these combine to cause an accident can only be
explained by a stringent and scientific study made by
teams of the kind that Harvard Medical School in the
United States has set up to probe the causes of fatal road
accidents. This 18-man medical and scientific team
Includes pathologists, blood chemists, tissue specialists,
psychiatrists and a sociologist.
As soon as a fatal accident occurs in Its area the team
Immediately goes to the spot and makes a thorough in¬
vestigation mechanical inspection and testing, checking
of air inside the car for carbon monoxide, study of tyre
tracks, examination of clues like paint chips on the dam¬
aged car, a study of surface conditions and road contours,
interviews with survivors, autopsy of victim, etc.
Each case Investigated Is a detailed, exhausting pro
cess. From hundreds of cases completed during a five
years' Inquiry will come knowledge to make life safer for
drivers and pedestrians.
The part played by speed, for Instance, has always been
over-simplified. There is evidence that, taken over a
driver's total mileage, most accidents on modern high¬
ways occur at lower speeds. The Harvard investigation
showed that many fatalities occurred at speeds of only
30 and even 15 m.p.h.
Other Investigations have shown that a driver's accident
rate drops as his speed rises and reaches a minimum at
about 65 m.p.h-, but rises sharply again at higher speeds.
In Britain It was found that twice as many casualties
occurred on roads with speed restrictions as on roads
without, but on the derestricted roads, 33% of the casual¬
ties were fatal as compared with 22% on restricted roads.
Facts like these need to be analysed and explained, and
although the answers to many questions are still not
known, basic research Is being carried out in most
countries of the world. Great Britain's Road Research
Laboratory, for example, has a traffic and safety section
doing research on roads, vehicles and their users, an
economic and statistical section, and one dealing with
road building methods and materials.
To keep a check on the Intensity and characteristics of
traffic of different types, the Laboratory maintains a
large number of automatic counters In continual opera¬
tion. Observations from fixed points and from moving
cars, and aerial photographs are used to study cross¬
roads and roundabouts, to measure how often and how
fast pedestrians cross the highway, and to assess the
types and speeds of different road vehicles. An electronic
RUSH HOUR IN TOKYO Is a scene repeated daily in cities across five continents whose highways are now
used by more than 1 00,000,000 four-wheeled and as many two-wheeled vehicles. The fact that one thousand
people die on the world's roads each day shows how traffic accidents have become a modern scourge.

brain gives precise Information concerning the effect of
traffic lights on the flow of traffic at cross-roads.
The Road Research Laboratory also undertakes sta¬
tistical analyses of the effect of different types of road
junctions, compares the frequency of accidents before
and after changes In the design, surface or lighting of a
road, and studies the Influence on accidents of speed
limits, pedestrian crossings, the removal of tram lines,
the construction of double carriageways, etc. Intensive
research Is being carried out on street lighting and road
surfacing.
The Road Research Laboratory has done remarkable
work In connexion with road surfaces and skidding. Step
by step each aspect of road surfaces Is minutely examined
to reveal defects and show the way to improvements.
More than a thousand tests are carried out every year
on wet roads (a wet road being more slippery than a dry
one) in a car equipped with a fifth wheel connected to a
special recording device. A portable apparatus has been
devised by which road engineers or public works depart¬
ments or firms can measure the skld-reslstance of roads
without having recourse to laboratory studies.
Sections of roads, representative of the British road
network, have been tested every fortnight for three and
a half years, making it possible to measure, and to some
extent to predict seasonal variations in the skid-
resistance of roads. The summer months appear to give
more trouble than the winter, for when a road which
has long remained dry Is moistened by a sudden shower,
It becomes very much more slippery than one subjected
to regular rains.
The Road Research Laboratory has also come to the
conclusion that special non-skid surfaces could become
more slippery than smooth surfaces if the sharp edges
of the gravel used in them became worn down. Far from
improving the grip of tyres on the road, they would, on
the contrary, act like smooth beads and Increase the risk
of skid. Even the best of surfaces, of course, will not
prevent an accident caused by weak braking or worn
tyres.'
Research probes Into each accident factor separately
but the final solution must be a function of all the
factors Involved. At the Road Research Laboratory the
behaviour of a vehicle and the qualities of the road itself
are therefore studied in close conjunction, one of the
essential alms of the work being to ensure that In an
emergency the driver of a car can pull up in the shortest
possible distance without danger to himself or to others.
But the ideal is still a long way oil. The first studies
carried out by the Road Research Laboratory showed
that the average braking distance for a car travelling
at 30 m.p.h. is 75 feet; for 10 per cent, of the cars tested
it was over 100 feet. The Highway Code lays down a
distance of 45 feet. Moreover, when a driver brakes In
an emergency the wheels frequently lock, and this not
only upsets the stability of the car but reduces the
effectiveness of the brakes to zero, the course of the
vehicle being slowed down only by the resistance offered
by the road. Other experiments have conclusively shown
the Importance of tyres for road safety. It Is common
knowledge that worn tyres are highly dangerous, but
few people realize that a complicated tread Is of no
particular advantage. All that matters Is that the tread
be deep.
Then there is that great unknown, the human factor.
Here too there is need for research and co-ordination of

ACCIDENT PRONE. Why some drivers

ers, irrespective of driving experience. Left,

research. If the psychologist Is to be able to put forward
anything better than mere theories, he must work
closely with the engineer, the policeman and the doctor.
Some not very successful attempts have been made to
draw up a composite picture of the man who is "accident-
prone" on the roads, as has been done for other types of
accidents. It has not been possible to establish any
certain link between accldent-proneness and physical or
psychophysiological fallings. One series of tests will
show that quick reactions lead to accidents, while another
demonstrates that quick reactions and slow reactions
cause about the same number of accidents. One medical
report will state that it is dangerous for people with high
blood pressure to drive; another that persons with low
blood pressure are liable to accidents. The one conclusion
to be drawn from these few examples Is that interpreta¬
tions of tests of psychomotor ability seem peculiarly
liable to error.
There Is both a simpler and a better way of looking at
the human factor. As an expert of the Harvard School
of Public Health has put It, "People drive as they live."
Dr. L. G. Norman, Physiclan-in-Chief to the London
Transport Executive, considers that a man's temperament
and his psychosocial qualities were they measurable
would make a better yardstick by which to tell a "bad"
driver.
From experience with London bus drivers, Dr. Norman
observes that given equal experience, the older driver
(even over 65 years old) Is a better one than the younger
man, despite slower reactions and less acute sight and
hearing. He is more watchful and takes more care to
anticipate dangerous situations, and in many cases this
more than makes up for deficiencies due to age.
According to another expert, marital status has a
definite influence on accldent-proneness. Married per¬
sons are less liable to accidental death than widowers,
who are in turn safer on the roads than divorcees. The
only exceptions to this rule are people under 20 years
of age; people In this age group have a higher percentage
of accidents when married than if they are single.
Alcohol, fatigue and sheer lack of attention are,
obviously, responsible for a very large number of
accidents but little systematic study has been made of
the causes underlying these factors whether physio¬
logical, or social.
From tests carried out by a special committee of the
British Medical Association it was concluded that a
concentration of 0.05 per cent of alcohol In the blood (one
and a half pints of beer or three small whiskies) is "the
highest that can be accepted as entirely consistent with
the safety of other road users."
Until a clearer light can be thrown on these obscure
matters, more limited but more Immediately realizable
goals may still be pursued. The Road Research Labora¬
tory, for Instance, has just begun a study on "the driver,"
In the course of which they propose to investigate,
separately and together, the driver's receptiveness to
instruction, his control over the car, and his behaviour
at the wheel. A special car will record and transmit
his reactions over four simultaneous radio circuits. This
experiment is still in a very early stage and its importance
cannot yet be judged, but at the very least It will be a
first step towards a real rather than a theoretical and
subjective picture of the car-driver's personality.
Other contributions to a more thorough knowledge of
the road-user include a study of the overtaking driver,
which Is now well-advanced, and research into the
behaviour of pedestrians.
In Great Britain the proportion of casualties to every
1,000 vehicles has steadily declined since the war. This
is attributed to road safety campaigns, improvements in
vehicle design and education of road usersespecially
children.
When all possible information has been obtained, It
may at last be possible for effective prevention to be
undertaken and for the roads of the world to be made
reasonably safe.

PEDESTRIAN PERILS
Today, no country can afford to neglect the safety-first education
of the man in the street as well as the man at the wheel. Growing
incidence of traffic accidents in Africa is reflected in poster
(below) which tells parents: "Don't let your children play in the
street." The problem is far more serious in traffic-thick Euro¬
pean and American countries. In Great Britain, for example,
pedestrians are involved in nearly one-half of all road fatalities.
A frequent cause of such accidents is lack of discipline when
crossing the street, like the case of the woman pedestrian
(right, rear of photo) who fails to use the proper crossing place.

The Untico Courler. April 1961
DID YOU KNOW THAT?
POISON HAZARDS: In the Uni¬
ted States, 1,200 people died from
accidental poisoning in 1959 and
about 200,000 were ill from the
same cause. A New York inquiry
showed that half the victims of
poisoning are under the age of 2 I ,
three-quarters of them being less
than four years old. Poisoning risks
would be immeasurably reduced if
the wrapping of dangerous subs¬
tances gave clear warning of dan¬
ger, named the poison involved and
identified the correct antidote to
be given in the case of an accident.
DEFECTS THAT KILL: Defec¬
tive brakes, tyres and steering gear
are the most frequent mechanical
causes of road accidents, although
head and rear lights too are often
found to contribute to highway
mishaps. In one country a safety
check showed that at least one In
five automobiles was not being
maintained in a safe running condi¬
tion, and one out of every four trucks
checked was in need of maintenance
before being mechanically fit for safe
driving. In Great Britain today all cars
over ten years old must pass a
compulsory road-worthiness test.
SOFTENING THE FALL: A
French school for building workers
has developed special methods for
teaching apprentices to fall even
from a height of two stories without
injury. Accidents of this kind are
less frequent than falls on the level,
but the results usually include at
least a broken bone or two. An
International Labour Convention
concerning safety provisions in the
building industry has now been
ratified by eleven countries which
maintain laws concerning scaffolds,
hoisting gear and safety equipment.
HIGH SCHOOL DRIVERS: Some
12,000 high schools In the U.S.A.
provide driving courses for 1,500,000
students and research has shown that
there has been a 40-66 % reduction
In accidents and traffic violations
involving students who have completed
a driver-training course. Courses
utilize the services of police officials,
judges, traffic and highway engineers,
and include visits to traffic courts and
freeway construction sites. Related
projects include traffic surveys, vehicle
checks. Students who pass the tests
also pay smaller Insurance premiums.
THE DEADLY DARE: Small ba¬
bies need complete protection, but
as they get older they should learn
to cope with danger. Over-pro¬
tecting children may lead to an over¬
development of the dare-devil spirit
which plays a part in many accidents.
In England, two boys lay down on
the railway tracks to play "last-off-
wins." They both won; no blame
attached to the engine driver. A
child may be more liable to have
accidents because of a conflict with
his parents or just simply because
tensions exist within the family.
STAY SEATED: Auto crash Injury
researchers In the United States found
that 12.8% of car occupants ejected
through open doors were killed, but
only 2.6% of those who remained in
the cars were killed. In a car crash the
motorist without a seat belt flics for¬
ward at unreduced speed until he hits
something solid. This Is the impact
that kills and malms. It is the violence
of the reduction In speed, not the
speed itself, which kills. Even low-
speed collisions can produce high dece¬
leration rates... and serious Injuries.
HOME, RISKY HOME: Moré men
aged I 5 to 64 have fatal accidents
at home than do women in the
same age group. But the over 65's
and the pre-school child fare worst.
These elderly people account for
more than half of the fatalities and
about one out of every four victims
is a young child. Commonest non¬
fatal home accident is a cut, but the
biggest home danger is a fall.
Smokers are largely responsible for
another home-hazardfires, which
are also often caused by children
who find and play with matches.
DON'T PULL THEM OUT: If
you are first at the scene of a car
crash your instinctive reaction is to
"get them out." Eighty per cent of
the people hurt are pulled but by
frantic rescuers and many are made
worse or even killed. Help out the
uninjured, but leave the injured for
trained first aid workers to move.
Some more precautions: park your
car some distance away, turn off the
ignition of the wrecked vehicle,
warn any approaching traffic. In case
of fire disconnect battery, attack fla¬
mes with extinguisher, dirt or blanket
SAFETY AND SCIENCE: Safety
first can be made a fascinating and
interesting subject In school science
lessons, m the Physics class pupils
may calculate reaction-time distance
ana braking distance. Chemistry
students may learn what makes the
chemicals used in fire extinguishers
effective, how a fire involving "hot"
electric wires should be dealt with
and what should be done if fire
breaks out under the bonnet of a
car. Safety precautions in the labo¬
ratory itself should be discussed
before and during experiments.
NEW WORD NEEDED: The ambi¬
guity of some words can lead to acci¬
dents. "Mummy" says the small child,
it says 'inflammable' on this tin. Does
It mean the stuff Inside will burn ?"
"Don't be silly, darling", sometimes is
the reply, "inflammable means that It
won't burn". Unfortunately, Mummy
is wrong, though can she really be bla¬
med when the language is full of oppo-
sltes ? A World Health Organization
meeting has now recommended that
"flammable" should be used to des¬
cribe something that ignites easily
with as an opposite "non-flammable".
Lexicographers are asked to note.
WORLD ON WHEELS: The num¬
ber of automobiles running on the
world's highways has increased tre¬
mendously since the Second World
War. Between 1938 and 1959 the
number of cars in France rose from
2,250,000 to 5,650,000 and of
motor cycles from 500,000 to
6,400,000. In the United States
there were 29,000,000 cars in
1938 and 70,500,000 in 1959.
The cost of road accidents has risen
proportionatly: $6,200,000,000 for
the United States alone in 19 59
and £ I 00,000,000 for Gt. Britain.
YOUR BEST FRIEND, BUT... In
the United States 600,000 persons
were bitten by dogs in 1957 and the
medical costs amounted to $5 million.
Many dog bites could be avoided If the
following rules were observed: Don't
give a dog to a child under the age of
six. Don't wake a dog suddenly.
Be careful of the mother when picking
up her puppies. Be careful when handling
sick dogs. Discourage your child from
riding a bicycle near an excited dog.
Teach children how to care for pets
and not to abuse or tease dogs. Don't
Eet or startle a dog while feeding
im. Don't intervene in a dog fight.

### 63842: Safety is their finest product in the factory

THEIR FINEST PRODUCT
In terms of the kinds of accidents that can kill, disable
or injure him, the industrial worker is his own worst
enemy. Evidence shows that a "human factor" is in¬
volved in more than 80 % of occupational accidents. The
man, therefore, and not the machine he operates is the
chief culprit responsible for the tremendous annual toll
of deaths and injuries among Industrial workers.
One International Labour Organization (ILO) report
published shortly after the last war showed that between
1939 and 1945, Industrial accidents in the United States
and Great Britain had killed more people than the war
itself. Yet these two countries were already at that time
well advanced In industrial accident prevention.
Figures for industrial accident rates since 1938 reveal
a strikingly small improvement over the pre-war situation.
Even in the United States and Britain the incidence of
accidents only decreased by 38% between 1938 and 1958.
Today's figures are equally disturbing. Each year in
Europe, between one-ninth and one-quarter of all workers
have a disabling accident. On an average between one
and four workers and sometimes as many as ten out of
every 10,000 are killed while at their jobs.
In the United States of America, out of a total of 91,000
accidental deaths from all causes, almost 14,000 are due
to industrial accidents. In France, a serious accident,
causing death or permanent invalidity, occurs every two
minutes, and even a small country like Switzerland has
an annual toll of over 200,000 occupational accidents, bet¬
ween 300 and 400 of them fatal ones. In countries that
are in the process of rapid Industrialization the problems
are totally different both in magnitude and urgency.
Between 1938 and 1958 in India, for Instance, the accident
rate increased in the proportion of from 100 to 240.
Already a vast amount of statistical research has
been made to ascertain what kinds of accidents
occur, in what numbers, to what types of people
and from what causes. The first and most surprising fact
revealed by an analysis of all types of industrial acci¬
dents is that only one in eight is caused by machines.
Vehicles, electricity, sources of heat and similar causes
are responsible for more than one-quarter of the total.
More than half are caused by what one expert has called
the Big Five: falls from a height; falls on the level;
handling materials; falling objects; hand tools. The
claim by one technician that today there are fewer risks
in manufacturing a sensitive explosive like nitro¬
glycerine than in transporting a heavy crate is perhaps
not as astonishing as would appear.
Statistics are indispensable for measuring the success
of preventive efforts and discovering the weak points to
which these efforts should be directed.
Here is how one of the largest chemical firms in Britain
deals with this problem. Every day from the firm's 110
factories and works, a sheaf of pink forms arrives on the
desk of Mr. J. St. Brown, who is head of its Safety
Division. Each one reports a "dangerous occurrence."
Copies of these reports are circulated to the Safety
Committees in each of the company's factories, together
with precise recommendations in each case.
The results of this company's far-sighted policy speak
for themselves. Among the 73,000 workers in the 110
factories for whose safety Mr. St. Brown Is responsible,
there were in 1959 only 386 accidents causing temporary
absence from work, nine serious accidents and five fatal
ones. These were the lowest figures in the company's
history and showed more than an 80% Improvement on
1945, and 25% improvement on the 1957 figures.
On the national scale it is much more difficult to
collect such exact Information as this. As Mr. Marcel
Robert, Chief of the Occupational Safety and Health
Division of the ILO, said recently: "In compiling
statistics, an accident is generally attributed to only one
cause, the most obvious one. In the great majority of
cases this is completely misleading because potentially
important accident factors are left out of account."
Two different lines of approach have developed In
Industrial safety efforts. One Is towards more and
more detailed legislation and towards measures to
improve the physical conditions of work.
The other Is towards education. According to partisans
of "education first," preventive measures should rather
be directed towards the worker. Moreover, they say, when
legislation and inspection procedures become too complex
and cumbersome, they are no longer respected.
These two approaches are of course complementary. No
accident is entirely due either to an outside cause or to
a human failing. Most experts on the question agree
today that industrial accidents, like all other accidents,
have multiple causes.
"Most of these," says Professor Victor Raymond, Medical
Adviser to the French Institut National de Sécurité, "arc
potential causes, they exist only as possibilities. No
accident will actually happen unless in one given place
and at one given moment, the different potential causes
come into operation together."
One day at a certain moment a man falls Into a hole.
The hole Is certainly a cause of the accident, for had
there been no hole there would have been no accident.
Yet it Is only a potential cause, for plenty of people pass
by unprotected holes without falling In.
For the accident to cease to be potential and become
actual, there must be this conjunction between the
victim and the material cause, which supposes a
precipitating factor. This factor may be Independent of
the victima falling stone or other object, a plank that
gives way, or a machine that breaks down. But frequent¬
ly this factor Is simply a movement or act of the victim
himself. For this, Professor Raymond has coined the
phrase le geste néfaste "the fatal action."
Most often, this fatal action Is an uncorrected condition¬
ed reflex. By their very repetition, many work movements
become stereotyped. The man becomes a kind of robot,
slave of the machines and objects he works with. His
work movements become mechanical, and always follow
the same pattern. Now suppose that the machine or the
objects the worker is concerned with suddenly present
some departure from the usual pattern. Unless the
worker's conditioned reflex is quickly corrected, the "fatal
action" will be made.

ACCIDENTS IN THE FACTORY (Cont'd)
Fortunately, the human being possesses protective
mechanisms against these "fatal actions." First there are
the primary reflexes which produce an "instinctive"
withdrawal from a danger usually perceived through the
sense of touch. Conditioned reflexes can also produce
similar protective reactions. "Once bitten, twice shy" says
the proverb. Reaction to fire is the classical example.
A child who actually touches a burning object will
withdraw his hand by a primary reflex action. An
association between the sight of fire and the sensation of
burning is established, and a conditioned reflex is created
which lasts throughout his life. Whenever he sees a
burning object getting too close, he withdraws.
Such protective reflexes can be developed by creating
associations between a danger and certain sights and
soundswarning by sirens or bells, and, very important,
notices and labels.
Finally the instinct of self-preservation that everyone
possesses can be strengthened and trained so that it
corrects, checks or co-ordinates habitual actions and
prevents them from becoming "fatal actions."
Yet this Instinct of self-preservation cannot be relied
on absolutely there will always be occasional eclipses.
When these happen, technical and mechanical safety
measures can often save the situation. To be effective
such measures should protect all workers alike and should
require no effort or co-operation from the individual.
They are based on the elimination of all risk. An example
is the prohibition of the use of white lead in paint, which
has automatically prevented white-lead poisoning among
the people working with paint.
Safety devices built into machines relieve the worker to
some extent of the need to be careful. Of course the
workers know about these safety devices and their role,
and it sometimes happens that they resent them because,
they say, they complicate their work. So they sometimes
remove them or put them out of action, temporarily or
permanently. Machines should therefore always be
provided with an automatic stop that operates whenever
their safety devices are not working. The less such a
device interferes with the worker's habits, the more
easily it will be accepted and used by him.
These safety measures are collective and do not require
the co-operation of the individual. There are others
which do require this. It is difficult enough to obtain
even the worker's passive co-operation, for instance in
following certain rules or going for a medical check-up.
If he is asked to take more active precautions, like
wearing gloves, special glasses or a mask, experience
shows that the results are usually unsatisfactory.
It is essential for each worker to know and understand
the risks to which he is exposed. Instructions must be
complete, detailed and precise in order not to create
simply a vague, uninformed fear of accidents. For
example, everyone knows vaguely that electricity is
dangerous. But it is not enough for someone to know
the dangers of lightning, or of high tension currents, if
he does not realize the dangers of the common 110 volt
or 220 volt household electricity supply.
Again, it is not enough just to tell people about such
risks they must really understand their nature. It is
for this reason that too much dependence cannot be
placed on rules, warnings, "forbidden" notices, etc. They
become so familiar that after a while they have no
further effect in preventing the "fatal action."
None of these "individual" safety measures can be
really effective unless the person they are intended to
protect is made to feel a partner in the scheme, and this
will depend largely on the attitude of the works manager.
He must set the pace. If he is genuinely concerned about
safety measures, the engineers and foremen will follow
suit, and the accident rate will soon reflect the success
of their combined efforts.

CAREFUL
WORKERS HIT
THE JACKPOT
Workers in a cement plant near Paris
nave an extra incentive to avoid acci¬
dents. Each year the management puts
up one million francs (10,000 New Francs)
into a special fund. For every man-day
lost through accidents 135 francs are
deducted and, at the end of the year,
the remainder is divided among the
workers, excluding office staff and fore¬
men. Left, how the plan pays off. In
1951 a total of 7,411 working days were
lost through accidents. But during the
first half of 1952, the total was only 209
and there were still over 970,000 francs
in the jackpot. Sign below says there
has been no accident tor past 24 days.

EVERY POSTER
TELLS A STORY
Graphic, dramatic and hard-hitting, posters are ideal for transmitting the
safety-first message in factory and workshop. Busy workers have no time
to read detailed or long-winded explanations. But a quick glance at a
poster whose message has been expressed simply and directly, immedi¬
ately brings home an essential safety rule in a form that sticks in the mind.
Sometimes a wordless poster is equally effective and offers a practical
solution to a problem in rapidly developing countries where countless
people work efficiently with modern machinery but still cannot read.

"Watch out for the hoist" says this Polish poster, using
an ant and elephant to symbolize a common threat to
workersthat of heavy objects falling on them from above.
"Bad scaffoldings make good crutches" is the reminder
of French poster (above) and "Don't walk under
overhanging loads" warns the Italian one (below).
"Watch where you put your feet." A Spanish poster illustrates some common
hazards for the worker, from open trapdoors to nails sticking out of planks.

HAZARDS IN FIELD AND FOREST
DANGER STALKS THE
The farmer and the farmworker are more exposed to
accident risks than perhaps any other section of the
population, a survey by WHO reveals. The farmer's
home Is also his work-place and combines the- dangers
of both.
Agricultural accidentslike those in the home, the
workshop or the factory have much in common the
world over. This has been shown by studies carried out
both in countries where agriculture has undergone
revolutionary changes in the past century and in others
where farming methods still follow traditional paths.
For example, investigations made in the United States
into the frequency and type of agricultural accidents in
7,000 Indiana farms showed that nearly 30% were due to
falls, most of them and the most serious being falls from
ladders. This situation can well be compared to Ceylon
where, out of a total of 2,800 deaths from all accidents
in 1957, 554, or nearly 20%, were caused by falls. In 350
cases the men who fell were tapping palm trees or picking
coconuts or fruit. Despite the dissimilarity of their
occupations, it looks as though the Indiana farmer and
the Ceylonese plantation worker run just about the same
risk of a fall.
In Great Britain, too, it is estimated that about one-
quarter of agricultural accidents are caused by falls. In
the same country a further 15% of accidents are caused
by handtools, 18% by light agricultural equipment, 18%
by burns and poisons and 10% by domestic animals.
"Never hold a sharp instrument pointed towards
yourself. Don't leave your pitchfork lying about. Test
your axe-handle before you use it. Never leave a scythe
standing in such a way that it can fall blade upwards. Be

careful with storm lanterns in hay barns. Don't try to
mend your ladder with a couple of nails and a piece of
twine..."
Though adages like these are continually heard from
childhood, they seem not to prevent overconfldence.
Trusting, consciously or not, to his own cleverness or
physical strength, the worker on the land, like the house¬
wife in her kitchen or the workman at his bench, all too
often forgets the risks with which he is over familiar.
The farmer trusts his "instinct" and the pragmatic
knowledge handed down from older generations he is
somewhat suspicious of the city expert. Yet good advice
that otherwise would be ignored will be listened to if it
comes from a respected elder or young farmer.
This is something that an agricultural safety campaign
must take into account. For to be effective such a
campaign should be entrusted to a man of the soil.
Unfortunately only in a few countries have existing safety
organizations set up special rural or agricultural sections.
Far too many countries still neglect the problem, although
there is much that could be done. For example, rural
schools should be provided with textbooks describing
hazards encountered on farms, and rural councils might
promote adult education on similar lines.
Nowadays the introduction of mechanized farming
brings fresh dangers. New machines, freeing the agri¬
cultural worker from the most arduous tasks and increas¬
ing his productivity, demand much greater vigilance and
care on his part. A sort of "sixth sense" of self-defence
which helps to guard the farm worker against the usual
kinds of accidents gives little protection against threshers
or mechanical harvesters.

### 63843: Danger stalks the farmer: hazards in field and forest

FARMER
Although he may be careless about it, the peasant
knows very well that his horse may kick him; but when
he gets his first brand-new tractor he little suspects that
this machine he is so proud of may have a deadly habit
of tipping over at the least expected moment.
One way to help counter these new risks would be to
require the manufacturer of agricultural machinery to
fix clear, legible and indelible safety warnings on his
products. Certain countries have also considered in¬
troducing agricultural driving licences which would
provide an opportunity to give agricultural workers the
safety training they so badly need. In Great Britain,
for example, agricultural safety advisers are trained and
do effective work in showing the farmer how to avoid
accidents with his new machines.
A start has already been made in applying industrial
accident-prevention methods to agriculture. With the
collaboration of the International Labour Organization, a
joint working party on forestry from the Economic
Commission for Europe and the Food and Agriculture
Organization studied the felling and sawing up or trees
and the carriage of logs to sawmills by land and water.
Its report provides detailed accident statistics, summarizes
safety regulations and describes provisions for inspection,
education, professional training, research, safety at
logging camps and sawmills, medical assistance, housing
and feeding.
Viewed in this light, agricultural accident prevention
becomes far more than merely protecting the rural popu¬
lation from accidents; it raises the whole question of
the adjustment of the agricultural worker to the present-
day economy and in so doing tends to lessen the différence
between him and the man in the workshop.

Overconfidence in using traditional cutting tools and careless¬
ness in operating powered machinery like threshers (below
left) are two basic causes oí accidents that occur on farms.
Timber felling and log-sawing are occupations In which a
moment of neglect or inattention can spell disaster. Mon
who work with sharp-edged axes or biting saw blades need
protection through the same kind of accident provontlon
methods and regulations that have become required in Industry.

### 63844: A Word of warning from stamps

A WORD OF WARNING
FROM STAMPS
by C.W. Hill
^BBSHm
1 ARGENTINA
Exhibitions, radio and television pro¬
grammes, newspaper advertising and
poster campaigns are used regularly
in many lands to promote the cause of safe¬
ty in the home, on the road and at work.
Few methods of publicity, however, reach
so many people at so small a cost as the
postage stamp and the postmark. In
recent years several countries have issued
stamps in aid of accident prevention and a
collection of these, when displayed at a
Safety Exhibition, always arouses consid¬
erable interest.
Argentina, in 1948, was the first country
to issue a stamp proclaiming the need for
care on the road (l). The design showed
a raised hand, familiar symbol of caution,
and the inscription "June 10 Road Safety
Day."
When the United States issued a stamp
commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of
the American Automobile Association, the
opportunity was taken of including in the
design a young safety warden holding back
two schoolgirls, while cars of 1900 and
1950 pass on the road. Two children
correctly using a road-crossing are depict¬
ed on a Swiss stamp of 1956 (2), but a
provocative West German stamp underlines
the perils of the road by showing a mother
mourning over her injured child (3).
"Care on the Road," symbolised on an
Italian stamp of 1957, is a message which
has also appeared in slogan postmarks
from many countries. "Motorists Care¬
lessness Kills!" says New Zealand; "Keep
Death off the Roads!" asks Great Britain;

UNITED STATES stamp issued in

railway engineers. It bears the
portrait of Casey Jones, the famous
American engine driver who met
his death in a railway accident
which occurred in 1900. Heroic
Casey ordered his fireman to jump
to safety while he remained at
the conti uls of his locomotive.

"Stop Accidents before they stop YOU!"
warns Australia; while Rhodesia's postmark
message is a little kindlier: "Drive Safe¬
ly Rhodesia needs you alive!".
Railway signalling equipment, which
plays so important a part in the preven¬
tion of accidents, is featured on many
stamps. There is an interesting link be¬
tween safety on the railways and safety in
the coal-mines, for George Stephenson, the
British builder of the first successful rail¬
way locomotive, also invented a safety
lamp for miners. A portrait of Stephen¬
son (4) and one of a coal-miner with a
modern safety lamp are to be found on
Hungarian stamps.
Many accidents in the home are caus¬
ed by fire, and several stamps have been
issued to give warning of its perils. Brazil
marked the centenary of the Firemen's
Corps in 1956 with a large stamp, print¬
ed in fiery red, showing a fireman
rescuing a child from a blazing building.
The International Fire Brigades' Congress
in Warsaw in 1957 was also marked by a
series of three Polish stamps, all in vivid
designs depicting the tragedies which may
be caused by fire (5).
A collection of stamps symbolising acci¬
dents and their prevention ought perhaps
to end on an optimistic note with some of the
many issues which illustrate the efficiency
of the Red Cross and hospital services.
These range from the speeding ambulance
on a Finnish stamp of 1944 (6) to the
nurse giving a blood transfusion shown on
a Yugoslav stamp of 1953.

### 63845: Treasures from the Parthenon

reasures from
the Parthenon
For twenty-four centuries the Parthenon has reflected the
glory of ancient Greece in her Golden Age of artistic achieve¬
ment. Conceived and constructed by Pericles and the
sculptor Phidias in the 5th century B.C., it was completed in
only 15 years in a frenzy of creative activity involving hundreds
of architects, sculptors and artisans. Today, although it
is partially destroyed and bereft of almost all its sculptures,
the purity of its lines and its harmonious proportions still
bear witness to its former splendour. The world's great
museums now house statuary, the bas reliefs and friezes
with which it was once richly ornamented. Many of these
sculptures have been photographed by F.L. Kenett and
gathered into a handsome album entitled "Classical Greece:
The Sculpture of the Parthenon" (1). Few of the pieces of
sculpture are undamaged, but even in their present state they
provide an imposing array of Greek plastic art at its finest.
On the following pages The Unesco Courier presents a few
of the Parthenon's former treasures, which are reproduced
from this album with the kind permission of the publishers.

When Keats saw this section of the Parthenon frieze in
London, he was moved to write, in his Ode on a Grecian
Urn, "To what green altar, O mysterious priest/ Lead'st thou
that heifer lowing at the skies/ And all her silken flanks with
garlands drest ?" The scene, depicting two Athenian citizens
leading a heifer destined for sacrifice, is one section of more
than 400 feet of the Parthenon frieze still in existence, most
of it In the British Museum. The frieze.which originally was
five hundred feet in length circled the inner wall of the
Parthenon above the capitals of the second row of columns.
It depicts a long procession of warriors, charioteers, bearers
of food and wine, virgins, citizens and mythological figures.
The frieze contained more than three hundred human
figures, and many animals. Although it was done by many
different sculptors, it retains a harmony of line, movement
and detail, and is unique because of its single theme.

### 63846: Japan misrepresented; a look at foreign textbooks

JAPAN MISREPRESENTED
A LOOK AT FOREIGN TEXTBOOKS
by Talsumi Shimada
This article is © I960, by the Asahl Shlmbun-sha, Tokyo.
Today, when the other side of the
moon is visible to us through
photographs, one would expect
people on one side of our own
globe to be well acquainted with the
opposite side. In fact, though, there is
a surprising lack of accurate knowledge.
With countries like those of Western
Europe, which are extremely close to
each other, and where travel is un¬
hampered even by the necessity for
visas, understanding between nations
can be hoped for.
However, greater distance not to
mention differences in ways of life, reli¬
gion and cultural forms soon reduces
this understanding to a far from satis¬
factory level. Even in such cases, a
constant supply of accurate information,
together with efforts toward comprehen¬
sion by both sides, ought to make it
possible to maintain a satisfactory degree
of understanding. In fact, however,
things do not work out this way.
People tend to have preconceived
ideas about distant countries. In particu¬
lar, inhabitants of far-off Europe and
America who have never seen Japan
seem to include such preconceived ideas
in the image they cherish of this coun¬
try. The unsavoury picture of Japan as
a country of militarists doubtless still
persists, and, along with it, the romantic
ideas associated with Madame Butterfly.
Not infrequently, Japanese who
happened to be travelling in foreign
parts have been taken by surprise by
the questions put by the local inhabi¬
tants. These range from specialized
queries on, say, "the role of Shintoism"
to elementary ones such as "does Japan
have trains and streetcars?"
There are many books on every coun¬
try written either by its own people or
by foreigners well versed in its affairs.
Perusal of them would normally suffice
to erase mistaken impressions. Unfor¬
tunately, people are seldom willing to
make a special effort to find out what
is happening in other countries unless it
directly concerns themselves. As a
result, no matter how many excellent
introductions and travel books appear,
the number of readers is restricted. In
view of this unsatisfactory situation, the
question arises of what should be done
to foster a correct knowledge of each
other at a more general level among the
peoples of the world.
In the case of Japan, about which
accurate knowledge tends to be very rare
and misapprehension common, the ques¬
tion of what practical steps can be taken
to improve this situation is a matter of
serious concern. A small number of
enthusiasts, therefore, recently made a
start albeit a very unspectacular one
toward remedying the situation, by
making a thorough investigation of in¬
accurate accounts of Japan in school
textbooks in use in foreign countries.
Textbooks, unlike specialist works, are
compulsory reading for schoolchildren
From Japanese Fomily (England, 1 9 50)
and students. This means that when
they misrepresent the truth about Japan
their harmful influence is extremely
pervasive. Once errors have occurred
in the basic facts given to children in
primary and middle schools, it is well-
nigh impossible to erase these first im¬
pressions. Yet a survey of textbooks,
collected from 31 countries, which was
begun in 1948, shocked those responsible
by the depressingly large number of
distorted views of Japan it revealed.
The need of some means to remedy this
situation was evident, and in April 1958,
the "International Society for Educa¬
tional Information" (1) was established
in Tokyo.
The textbooks gathered together by
this Centre via the Foreign Ministry,

Kaikan, 22-7 Yolsuya 1-choine, Tokyo, Japan,
and the director is Nishimura Kumao.
the Japan Red Cross and private firms
and organizations already total 925
volumes from 16 countries in Europe
(including the Soviet Union), four in
the Middle East, ten in Asia and five
in the Americas. Comprising primary,
secondary, and high-school textbooks
mostly published between 1955 and
1959, they arc the works at present in
use in those countries.
In accordance with the purposes of
the survey, the majority of them arc
textbooks of geography, history and
social science. The materials thus
collected have been studied by specialist
professors and linguists in Japanese
universities. The more their investiga¬
tion proceeds, the more apparent be¬
comes the large number of inaccuracies
and outright errors in the contents of the
articles on Japan. Many cases have
also been discovered where very old
photographs and illustrations depicting
Japan in the Mciji or Taisho Period are
presented as if they showed modern
conditions.
Such cases have come as a shock to
those taking part in the survey.
The most conspicuous among them arc
the photographs and illustrations used
in the textbooks, the photographs gen¬
erally being extremely old and many of
the illustrations showing strange people
and ways of life which suggest a mixture
of Japanese and Chinese cultures without
representing cither of them accurately.
The early Mciji Period roughly
from the 1870's into the 1890's saw
work started on the Panama Canal in the
New World (1881) and on the Trans-
Siberian Railway in the Old, while in Asia
Burma was annexed by Britain in 1886.
If, in the case of any other country,
street scenes or local manners of this
period were represented as those of
today, it would cause no little surprise.
In most countries there are even con¬
siderable differences between ways of
life before and after the Second World
War. This being so, it would be a
shock to anyone, let alone the Japanese,
to find children being shown without
any explanation conditions as they
existed nearly a century ago.
In the case of Japan, however, moder¬
nization started late, and astonishing

changes occurred even within fifty years.
The large towns change in appearance
from year to year, and even in country
towns and villages a constant transfor¬
mation is in progress. All this is ignored
in many foreign textbooks, however;
children arc presented with any material
that comes to hand, however old, and
told, "This is Japan."
One example is an English textbook
called Japanese Family (2). Though
comparatively new it was published
only ten years ago, in 1950the Japa¬
nese family life shown is a most peculiar
mixture of Chinese and Japanese styles,
and of the old-fashioned. The illustra¬
tions, for instance, show father and
daughter riding in a rickshaw a thing
one would have difficulty finding in
Japan today while a family like
something out of a fairy tale is shown
gazing over the sea wondering whether
there will be an earthquake or not!
One shudders to think of English chil¬
dren getting the idea that the "quaint
Japanese" arc like this, but what is
still worse is that the writer of the text¬
book seems to be unaware that such
things never existed at any period in
Japan. I am not, of course, picking out
this English textbook for particular cri¬
ticism. Endless examples of much the
same kind of error can be found in those
of other countries too.
For instance, an Italian high-school
geography textbook entitled Le Parti del
Mondo (3) carries the Kambara print
from Hiroshige's Fifty-three Stages on
the Tokaido with the caption "Snow
Scene in Hokkaido, or Ezo." One
wishes the author would let Italian
children know that this particular ukiyoe
was published in 1833! Pictures such
as the Hiroshige are acceptable any¬
where provided they are clearly labelled
as works of art.
However in works such as a primary-
school reader (4) published in Egypt in
1957, in an Indian geography textbook
entitled Over Land and Sea (5), in the
Australian This Modern Age (6), and in
the American The Background of
Modern Nations (7), one can only pre¬
sume that the illustrations were free

fantasies by artists who had never been

Some of the incorrect accounts of
Japan deal with things which, though not
completely unknown in Japan, are by
now far from common sights. For
example, in an Italian geography text¬
book for readers at secondary-school
level there appears a photograph of a
Japanese woman with her back covered
all over with tattooing, over the caption:
"In Japan there is a general tendency
for women also to tattoo themselves."
Not only is this astonishing in a text¬
book published in 1957, but it will cer¬
tainly make Italian children start off
from the first year of secondary educa¬
tion with the impression that Japan must
be a very savage country. There would
be no objection if it were used in a book
with some such title as "Believe it or
not", but a school textbook about a
country should stick to the customs
prevailing among the larger part of its
population.
In practice, though, the compilers tend
to pick out only the odd and peculiar
customs in order to stimulate the
curiosity of the reader. This is true not
only of books on Japan: it is a point on
which all the nations of the world should
exercise care, for each other's sakes.
In Japan's case, for instance, something
should be done about the tendency in
the tourist posters and leaflets she her¬
self puts out to over-emphasize the old,
traditional Japan.
Here is one of the reasons why the
modern Japan (which admittedly, being
Westernized to a considerable extent, is
less interesting to foreigners) is reported
incorrectly. Here is something for Japan
herself to remedy; it remains true,
however, that the compilers of text¬
books abroad should realize the im¬
portance of their mission in promoting
mutual understanding among the youn¬
ger generation in different countries, and
work harder to present the true rather
than merely the curious.

tional Information is at present con¬

books to the matter, and by sending
correct information from Japan.
The textbooks being published in
Japan are also, quite possibly, out-of-date
or incorrect in some respects. Gradually
to reduce the number of such errors on
all sides would help greatly in supplying
the young folk who will form the next
generation with the correct information
necessary for judging international
affairs, and for this, international co¬
operation on a wide scale is most
desirable.
It may be added in conclusion that
the same Society also held exhibitions
From Over Land and Sea (England, 19 56)
in Tokyo and Osaka in late 1959 and
early 1960, entitled "Japan Misrepre¬
sented: A Look at Foreign Textbooks,"
which put on public view the textbooks
so far gathered together. The exhibitions
drew large crowds and attracted much
interest in newspapers and periodicals.

The Uneico Courier. April 1941
Letters to the Editor..
NEW VIEW ON THINGS
Sir,
Since 1957 I have been a constant
reader, and with the exception of one
or two issues and articles, I like the
contents and make-up. I particularly
liked the issues of a '"thematic"
character such as: "The Rights of
900 Million Children" (October 1957),
"East-West" (December 1958),
"Science and Humanity" (February
1959), "Cinematography" (April
1959) and "The Art of Czech Glass-
Blowers" (March 1960), and an article
about Sholem Aleichem in the same
issue. It is also noticeable from the
point of view of humanism that the
magazine tells its readers about the
life of other peoples, the problems
which face them, about little-known
civilizations and the latest achieve¬
ments in science and technology.
The magazine gives me fresh know¬
ledge and sometimes helps me to see
things with new eyes. Its support for
the ideals of peace, humanism and
friendship among peoples deserves
high praise.
While noting the good points of
the magazine, I would like to make
some suggestions which might im¬
prove it. I think the time has come
to increase the size of the magazine
and introduce a regular page of hu¬
mour, to pay more attention to the
everyday life and culture of peoples
and their traditions. For instance,
one issue could be devoted to the
Russian school of ballet which has
been made famous the world over by
such great ballerinas as Anna Pav¬
lova, Galina Ulanova and Olga Lep-
eshinskaya.
A Kilunov,
Sverdlovsk, U.S.S.R.
VELAZQUEZ AND HIS ART
Sir,
Allow me to congratulate you on
the excellent special issue on Velaz¬
quez and his art (Dec, 1960). Paint¬
ing, when it is not cranky, is a uni¬
versal language, and (like the word
of God) creates not only light but
life also at the same time. It is capa¬
ble of linking eternity with the work-
a-day world.
In a madding and maddening world
wherein neurotic men sit on atomic
weapons (always in limelight) and
look down upon men with wiser
counsels with a devilish leer, the
saner people will find painting as one
of the good things of life. What is
needed in the organ of the world
forum is emphasis on the essential
beauty, unity and sublimity of the
human soul.
Special issues such as these might
really serve as links between the dif¬
ferent peoples of the world and their
cultures and might be able to turn the
"still sad music of humanity" into
a triumphal march of love, harmony,
understanding and co-operation among
the nations of the world. I hope you
will publish more issues on art, Eas¬
tern as well as Western, every year.
D. Viswanadlia Kabu
Vizayanagaram, India
Sir,
It is an exaggeration to devote a
whole 40-page issue to Velazquez.
Whatever the talent of this artist,
there are much wider and more im¬
portant questions to present in your
magazine and such specialized studies
as those concerning a painter's life
and work should be restricted to a
few pages.
A. Kilunov
Sverdlovsk, LLS.S.R.
Sir,
That you should have devoted the
whole of the issue to one great paint¬
er is in itself gratifying and typical
of the cultural work of Unesco, but
the way you have treated it really is
outstanding.

PERU'S TREASURES IN DANGER
Sir,
In The Unesco Courier, for Feb¬
ruary 1960 (Save the Treasures of
Nubia), the articles rightly reflect the
concern we all feel about the fate of
the prehistoric buildings in the Nile
valley, as they are in danger of being
destroyed or irretrievably lost when
work on the high dam of Aswan is
completed.
In Peru, which, like Egypt, is a land
of great archaeological riches, some¬
thing similar is happening. On the
one hand, the economic and industrial
interests invade the sites, in spite of
the excellent law that exists to prevent
it. On the other hand, the personal
ambitions of certain individuals who
traffic in antiques, breaking all rules
and regulations, stimulate the activi¬
ties of the wakeros, or tomb-thieves,
by means of bribes or presents. In
the outskirts of Lima, the capital of
the Republic, the "wakas" or archaeo¬
logical sites and buildings, are being
destroyed under the pretext of town-
planning developments. Incaic and
pre-Incaic burial grounds that exist in
the coastal valleys, are being destroy¬
ed with the excuse of irrigation pro¬
jects or the installation of factories.
May Unesco turn its eyes to this
corner of the American continent, to
co-operate with the Government of
Peru in the protection and rescue of
the prehistoric monuments of the An¬
dean Civilizations.
M. Toribio Mejia Xesspe
Archaeologist, Lima, Peru
WESTERN ETHNOCENTRISM
Sir.
I buy The Unesco Courier now
and again for the pictures. 1 try to
assimilate a bit of the information
which glimmers through the articles,
steeped, as they are, in Western ethno-
centrism. For example, "7 Million
Forgotten Indians in the Andes":
your constant use of the word "prob¬
lem"; your gross judgment of their
"unclean" living conditions and
"promiscuous" sleeping arrangements;
your proud advertisement of the fact
that they have been forced to admit
to their "ignorance" (of what? Catho¬
licism? John Locke? how to live at
high altitudes?); your insistence that
the rest of us admire and support
you in your glorious duty to inflict
your values on these Indians only
show forth your small minds which
rest in, no doubt, comfort-conditioned
bodies. Docs the United Nations stand
for coexistence of values or only of
peoples?

SHOW US THE SORBONNE
Sir,
We arc regular readers of your very
interesting magazine and would be
glad if you could give a detailed des¬
cription of the Sorbonne University in
Paris, with pictures of the Sorbonne
itself, its sections for the humanities,
the university library and the Assem¬
bly Hall.

HEN WITH THE GOLDEN CHICKS
Sir,
In connexion with the Visigothic
treasure trove which, according to the
article in your November 1960 issue,
is known in Rumania as "The Hen
with the Golden Chicks," a legend
from Gotland seems significant.
On this mid-Baltic ancestral home
island of the Goths a golden bird and
24 smaller ones are said to have been
found under loosened stones from the
chancel wall in St. Clement's, Visby.
As for the link between Gothic and
Lombard art, mentioned in your fasci¬
nating feature, another fine treasure
comes to mind. San Giovanni Dattista
at Monza comprises such ancient ob¬
jects as the ones given to the cathe>
dral by the 6th century Queen Theo-
dolinda: a votive golden crown, the
celebrated Iron Crown of Lombardy,
and a plate with a golden hen and
chicks!

f^ LOAKING THE STEPPES: Forest
planting has now begun on the plains of
the southern Ukraine, in the Odessa region
on the 'slopes of hills where fertility is
low and on soil which is susceptible to
erosion. The forests, covering a total area
of 600,000 acres, are to be planted by
1965. Forest oases of quickly-growing
trees poplar, aspen, maple and acacia
will reach from the mouth of the Danube
northwards to the Bug, creating a micro¬
climate and protecting the soil from ero¬
sion. At the same time the cultivated fields
will be bordered by protective belts to
shield them from frost and the spring dust
storms.
UNESCO'S 100 MEMBERS: Unes¬
co has now 100 Member States. The
latest country to join the organization,
and thus bring Unesco its century of
members, is Cyprus.
WiORLD WEATHER DAY: The im¬
portance of meteorology in the lives of
everyone was highlighted last month by the
first annual celebration of World Meteoro¬
logical Day on March 23 anniversary date
of the creation of the World Meteorologi¬
cal Organization (WMO) in 1950. At that
time, WMO (a U.N. Specialized Agency)
took over the work which the International
Meteorological Organization had been
doing since 1878 to perfect and standardize
meteorological activities, especially services
to maritime navigation, agriculture and,
increasingly, to aviation. WMO's far-
flung activities today include: water re¬
source development, technical assistance in
meteorology and hydrology, weather fore¬
casting for jet aircraft, tidal wave study
and warning service, maritime and fish¬
eries meteorology, and the publication of
cloud and climatic atlases.

tion for the Galapagos Isles, which is
now developing the world's first inter¬

Science Foundation in Washington.
The Darwin Foundation, established in
1959 one hundred years after the pub¬
lication of Darwin's "Origin of Spe¬
cies", has been set up under the ¡oint
sponsorship of Unesco and the Inter¬
national Union for the Conservation of
Nature and Natural Resources. At pres¬
ent Mr. Raymond Levêque, a Swiss
biologist, is in the Galapagos on a
Unesco technical assistance mission
the third scientist to be sent by Unesco
to these islands off the coast of Ecua¬
dor, where Charles Darwin gathered a
rich harvest of knowledge. The recent
grant of $ 6,500 will be used to build
RITCHIE CALDER AWARDED
KALINGA PRIZE
A lifetime spent roaming the world and exploring Its scientific frontiers to make them
less remote for the general public was honoured last month In Paris when Unesco
announced the selection of Ritchie Calder, leading British science writer, as winner of
the annual International Kalinga Prize for the popularization of science.
Widely known as a radio and television broadcaster as well as an author, Mr. Calder is
the ninth winner of the prize of 1,000 pounds sterling, offered by the Kalinga Foundation.
The purpose of this award, donated by Mr. B. Patnaik, an Indian industrialist, is to offer
recognition to leading interpreters of science and also to strengthen links between India
and scientists of all nations. The prize is awarded every year by an international jury
appointed by Unesco.
Mr. Calder was science editor of the News Chronicle in London from 1945 to 1956
and of the New Statesman and Nation from 1 945 to 1 958. His fifteen books on scientific
subjects ranging from medicine to the struggle for life in the Arctic have been translated
Into a dozen languages. Mr. Calder has gone on extensive missions for Unesco and other
United Nations agencies to tell the story of their field work. Many articles by him have
been published In The Unesco Courier.
laboratories at the station, and Unesco
has granted $ 9,000 for scientific equip¬
ment. One of the aims of the foun¬

the unique wild life of the Galapagos
which have been termed a "show win¬
dow of evolution."

M«OST TRANSLATED AUTHOR:
With translations of 198 of his works and
speeches published in 1959, Nikita Krush¬
chev became the most translated author for
the year, topping Vladimir I. Lenin (174
translations) who has headed the list in
previous years. Most of the works were
translated into the various languages of
the Soviet Union. Both these authors are
immediately followed by a book of which
there was no single author The Bible
which was translated 171 times in 1959.
These figures are listed in the twelfth edi¬
tion of Index Translationum published an¬
nually by Unesco (price $ 18.50; 92/6 stg.).
In the latest edition a total of 29,661 trans¬
lations are recorded, nearly all of them
appearing in 1959.
THREE-DLMENSIONAL TEXT¬
BOOKS: The days are past when
sombre, cloth-covered textbooks with
closely printed pages made studies seem
like a punishment rather than a quest
for knowledge. That, at least, is the
impression given by a recent exhibition
in London where textbooks from several
European countries revealed the many
qualities of good modern publications
with their attractive covers, profuse
illustrations and clear typography.
Among them was a manual on architec¬
tural geometry with three-dimensional
