Legend of ancient Persia
There was once a Persian prince named Bahram Gur, a peerless marksman
with bow and arrow. One day he set off for the hunt, taking with him his
lovely wife Azadeh... So runs an ancient story of love and great deeds
told by the famous Persian poet Firdausi in the Shahnama (The Book of
Kings). In the 60,000 verses of this 10th century epic poem, to which
he devoted 35 years of his life, Firdausi recounts the myths and legends
of ancient Persia. The delicately painted 13th century tile shown above
is from the Museum of Islamic Art, Cairo, and portrays the departure of
the royal huntsman and his princess. Cairo, capital of the United Arab
Republic, this year celebrates the 1,000th anniversary of its foundation
by the Fatimid dynasty, descendants of the Prophet Mohammed.

YOUTH
IN FERMENT
'The gulf separating young people from adults
seems to be growing bigger every day... This
revolt is sweeping across virtually every part
of the world; it has taken on the form of an
open dispute, not only with the university but
with society as a whole.'
'With their need for absolutes, the young are
less than ever able to tolerate the injustices
and disorder of the world. '
RENE MAHEU
Director-General of Unesco

THE wave of protest and dissent from world youth has
made society sit up and look for an answer, and first of
all the reasons why. Though the ferment of youth is a univer¬
sal phenomenon, the complexity of the problems is due to the
many different categories of young people and the wide
variety of their social, economic and cultural backgrounds and
makes generalization difficult, if not impossible. Unesco has
now begun an international enquiry on youth in collaboration
with the United Nations and its Specialized Agencies and a
number of specialized research institutions. Its purpose is
to gather a maximum of data from every continent on the atti¬
tudes of youth to society, their aspirations, doubts and dissen¬
sions and their view of the future. The UNESCO COURIER
proposes to deal in future issues with the results of this vast
enquiry. This number seeks to present aspects of the ferment
of world youth in a broader canvas. The article below (pages
4 to 14) is based on a preliminary study prepared by Unesco
and shortly to be published as a booklet under the title "In
Partnership with Youth".
I HE world is getting younger
and youth accounts for an ever larger
share of the rapid rise in world
population. It is estimated that the
15-24 age group will rise from 519 mil¬
lion to 1,128 million in the four decades
between 1960 and the year 2000.
More than 75 per cent of the world's
young people today live In developing
countries: 59 million in Africa, 322 mil¬
lion in Asia, 44 million in Latin America.
This striking demographic change
was foreseen long ago, but not
everyone has prepared for it. In
many cases, new generations have
come of age in a vacuum.
Unpreparedness explains the con¬
tradictions, the tensions and the
shocks that we are now witnessing .
as youth moves en masse into present-
day society and tries to reshape it.
Wherever this urge runs counter to
existing structures, it generates a

contrary tendency towards 'anxiety,
escapism and scepticism. Through
lack of preparedness, society has left
itself open to heavy blows. Yet these
very blows have a positive effect:
they lead to awareness, they dramatize
the phenomenon and the problems of
youth, they inspire major efforts to
solve them.
In search of a common denominator.
Many people tend to look upon youth
as just one of the "age groups" of
life. And most "youth programmes"
are designed with the 15-25 age group
in mind. No one will deny that such
a classification has its practical uses,
but it can hardly serve as a common
denominator to cover the many
complex problems and the great
diversity of individuals that make up
this age group even in one country.
It is all the harder to use it as a
universal criterion s.nce the laws,
customs and institutions governing the
age of consent, the age of legal
majority, or the age of full social
responsibility vary considerably from
country to country and from continent
to continent.
Attempts have also been made to
define youth as a given "educational,
social and family situation": as those
still going to school, who have neither
started work nor set up their own
home. An adult, according to this
definition, is a person who has finished
school, holds a job and has a family.
Yet here, too, no universal formula
can be applied. Differences among
various types of societies are too
great, the. transition between, young
and adult worlds is too gradual.
There is some justification for
defining youth as "a state of mind".
Such a definition could then embrace
all those identified by "the quality of
their imagination, their preference for
boldness over timidity and their love
of adventure rather than creature
comforts." But this criterion is no
more adaptable than the others to the
plethora of situations affecting the
individuals and social group (whether
"young" or "adult" by conventional
standards) that it claims to identify.
The social, economic and psycholo¬
gical fabric of youth is too varied to
allow any pat general definitions.
Those who deal with social and human
problems of this nature would do well
to keep to a cautious open-ended
statement. That is why a compromise
definition is often a pragmatic one:
young people are those persons
society deems young.
Youth a multiple entity. We hear
a great deal of talk about "youth".
Programmes are established "for
youth", plans are drawn up "to help

youth." In fact, when we talk of youth,
we are talking about a social and
psychological entity that is extremely
heterogenous and complex. Its com¬
ponents must be more clearly iden¬
tified. They overlap and their number
is legion.
From the sociological viewpoint,
the main categories are rural and city
youth, young people who have had
little or no education to speak of,
secondary school and college
students, and young workers. This is
something of an oversimplication, of
course. It ignores differences among
countries and within each category.
Youth's hopes, needs and attitudes
vary from place to place. So do the
measures required to meet them.
On a world scale, rural youth is
the biggest category of all. But its
status Is ambiguous. In the rural-type
economies of developing countries,
rural youth play an important rôle,
but traditional social structures and
effects of partial and latent unemploy¬
ment prevent them from influencing
economic development as a coherent
social group.
City youth are often underemployed
or out of work, particularly among the
urban poor whose ranks are constantly
swollen by the human drain from the
countryside. Unintegrated into the
social and cultural environment of city
life which is foreign to them, many
young people in towns lead a hand-to-
mouth existence on the fringes of
society and- borders of delinquency.
They are dissatisfied, their malaise is
profound.
Young people who have had no
schooling form another big group.
Around 1962, it was estimated that
there were 146 million young illiterates
in the world between 15 and 24 years
of age. Illiteracy rates in Africa are 46
per cent in the 10-14 age bracket; 51
per cent from 15 to 19; and 64 per cent
from 20 to 24. In Asia, there are about
50 million illiterates aged between 10
and 14; 42 million between 15 and 19
and 44 million between 20 and 24.
Deprived of schooling, theirs is a
permanent state of social, civic and
economic frustration. Small wonder
that diversified personalities do not
blossom forth from such a soil. Under
different conditions, they would be
a reservoir of strength that could
be harnessed for economic growth.
Instead, they act as a drag on develop¬
ment.
The number of young workers is
constantly going up and many feel
insecure as they see how technology
transforms their jobs. Their main
concerns are vocational guidance and
training, mobility and job security.
The number of secondary school
students in the world today is quite
impressive, having almost doubled in
the fifteen years between 1950-51 and
1965-66. Education, in certain sub¬
jects, now begins at a much earlier
age than before to the extent that
students now identify themselves with
social and civic movements in their
community or country as they have
never done in the past. Consequently,
it is not surprising to find them joining
forces with university students, and
in certain developing countries, even
playing a role similar to that of the
university students themselves.
College and university students are
a rapidly growing element in society
and, in many respects, they form the
great vanguard of youth today. From
1960 to 1965, their world total rose
from 11,174,000 to 16,015,000 persons,
a phenomenal increase of 61 per cent.
Both in terms of numbers and capa¬
bility, university students represent a
new force in society and the powerful
influence they now exercise has
particular relevance in the contem¬
porary context.
In the industrial countries, the
number of college students from low-
income families is rising steadily while
middle class enrolment continues to
go up. In developing countries, de¬
colonization and social progress are
two factors that have given great
impetus to university enrolment.
Viewed as a whole, the vast army
of the young is gradually evolving into
a determined though multi-faceted
social group, possessing its own
dynamic momentum, and making a
novel contribution to the process of
social change.
Today's youth are different. Numbers
alone do not tell the story. Many
social changes also affect youth's life,
status and rôle in the world.
First are changes in family
structures. Children split off. from
their families at earlier and earlier
ages. Youth's yearning for inde¬
pendence from their parents has been
observed in every society.
Traditional community structures are
also withering. They are poorly
adapted to the demands of technical
and economic development. Young
people are eager for change and need
emancipation from the rule of elders
to strike out on their own.
Meanwhile, institutions, customs and
economic conditions have altered and
most young people of today start
working at a later age than their
parents did. No doubt this Is an
improvement, but such a long wait
tends to isolate youth in society. It
keeps them in a situation where they
are denied the rights and responsibi¬
lities of adulthood because of the very
fact that they are unbound by its main
obligations.
But there is probably nothing that
has influenced youth more deeply than
the impact of scientific and technolo¬
gical development on society, the
crisis of our tentacular cities and the
revolution in our modern ways of life
and high speed communications.
These factors have disturbed, be¬
wildered and disrupted the lives of
the young, but at the same time they
have given youth unique opportunities
for assertion. The rôle of young
people in the modern world has thus
taken on extraordinary new dimen¬
sions. Not only because of their
sheer strength of numbers but also
because of the specific part they can
play in the changes implied by modern
development.
A new generation gap. Youth have
now achieved the status of a distinct
community. This has led to the most
basic conflict of all: it stems from
youth's determination to win from
society the status and esteem they
deem to be their right. It is endemic
in universities and schools, in factories
and villages, and certainly in institu¬
tions designed for youth but usually
run by adults.
These demands often clash with the
adult world's tendency to regard youth
as awaiting admission into society.
Until the young have crossed the
barrier, adults believe, they have no
claim on all the rights denied them
even though this does not prevent
society from demanding youth's contri¬
bution when necessary.
Then there is an intellectual, and
moral conflict that widens the gap
between youth and adults with every
passing day. Modern information
media familiarize youth with different
cultures while ignoring frontiers. On
a world scale, a sort of international
"youth culture" seems to have sprung

YOUTH IN FERMENT (Continued)
The many forms of contestation
up. It clashes head-on with an
adult culture still fenced in by tradition.
This leads to conflicts of opinions,
customs, behaviour and ethical prin¬
ciples that affect the very foundations
of modern society. It raises problems
whose gravity is keenly felt on all
sides. These may be the hardest
problems of all to solve under present
circumstances.
Here, it is interesting to note that
the split is almost at Its widest over
the Issue of policies leading to inter¬
national solidarity. Many young people
are amazed when they see that the
most unprecedented technological
progress that the world has ever seen
does not go hand in hand with the
establishment of peace and justice on
earth. They see, too, how little it con¬
tributes to the welfare of mankind's
underdeveloped two-thirds. And a
form of youthful internationalism is
taking shape.
Everywhere in the world, more and
more young people are demonstrating
against war and injustice. It would be
worthwhile to measure the strength of
youthful Internationalism compared to
certain displays of nationalism from
which many of them are no more
immune than their elders. These are
the new facts that lend a new
dimension to the old problems of
conflicts between generations.
w

HILE no one denies educ¬
ation's positive contribution, various
educators and psychologists have their
doubts about certain teaching methods.
Parents are eager to see their chil¬
dren take their place in society and,
starting at an early age, use certain
methods to teach them the rules of an
adult world. Then comes school where
they undergo other forms of training
occasionally designed to prevent them
from "harming" society before they are
perfectly integrated into it.
Even when adults accept children
as personalities, they often refuse to
admit that children can exist as a
community by and among themselves.
Instead of aiding the creation of a
youthful society, adults fight it in
different ways: discipline, punishments,
competition, appeals to pride and
other methods that try to force the
child to conform to adult society.
Similar practices are prevalent In
clubs and organizations created for
youth but where attempts are often
made to force adult culture down their
throats: in the army where discipline
exists to "build character"; in youth
movements where appeals to youth's
generosity and patriotism are occa¬
sionally motivated by a need not to
serve but to use youth.
At times? youth feel they are being
"manipulated" and make no bones
about expressing resentment. This
¡s a way of reacting against attempts
not only by teachers but by social and
cultural institutions, political parties
and businessmen to direct or influence
them. It many cases, youth's suspicions
are unwarranted, but their reactions are
quite understandable in situations
where social and political corruption
and decadence prevail or where they
must confront school systems suffering
from inertia or sclerosis.
Young people may react the same
way against the occasional tendency
of authorities or the powers-that-be to
throw cold water on any adolescent
values that run against the current
grain of centralization, organization and
rationalization. Such values are
exemplified by spontaneity, deliberate
irresponsibility, idealism, refusal to
take orders and wariness of rational
solutions as soon as they are applied
to human problems.
Certain young people even see
"manipulation" in efforts to "cultivate"
them before they are old enough to
put up a fight against the prestige and
the pitfalls of a ready-made culture.
They can also rebel against other
efforts to lead them into "participa¬
tion" or "dialogues" in exchange for
reforms that they consider of no
importance.
Arbitrary manipulation of youth is
only one aspect. Then there Is the
use of the entire myth of youth for
political or business purposes. It is
typified by certain large firms that
discovered the importance of the
"youth market", then began to churn
out all sorts of products magazines,
records, clothes, shows designed for
the young market. Youth do not find
it any easier to achieve emancipation
after being brain-washed in this
manner.
Everyone agrees today that youth
seek contestation in a form that can
be more or less radical, direct or
obvious. Its purpose is to eliminate
certain anomalies or to resist certain
temptations, to display disappoint¬
ment, to emphasize non-commitment
or to speed processes of change that
have already begun.
One cannot afford to overlook any
form of youthful contestation whether
violent or peaceful, apparently justified
or useless, open or more or less
hidden. Take youth in developing
countries: there they must steer a
course somewhere between ancestral
tradition and modern ways. The great
migratory movement into cities is
certainly governed by economic fac¬
tors, but does it not also represent
a form of protest by a young genera¬
tion that refuses to work the lands
of their forefathers ?
IN a large number of coun¬
tries, deep-seated radical, social and
economic change, whether socialist or
not, has been wrought either at the
end of World War II or during the
decolonization process. Many a bright
hope for economic, social and cultural
progress and particularly change in
social structures, has come a cropper
against lack of funds or has been
dashed by slowness of execution.
Contestation by youth often reflects
this situation, particularly the tension
between those who fought for inde¬
pendence and the others. Youth try
to link promises to results and ideals
to achievements while at the same
time fighting inertia and denouncing
adults for their slowness and bureau¬
cratic ways.
In many countries, youth have moved
into a stage of more or less open
rebellion. Young people display their
disapproval of racial segregation and
linguistic discrimination, they protest
against the paternalism and the living
conditions they must endure, they have
risen up against social conformity,
they have denounced the myths of
"production for production's sake" and
"consumption for consumption's sake".
Some very spectacular forms of
protest have blossomed out almost
overnight in recent years in industrial
societies and they have slowly moved
into the big cities of the developing
world. They go by different names,
they take different shapes: songs
against war and for love, long hair,
weird clothes, pot and promiscuity,
teddy boys, vitelloni, halbstarke, hooli¬
gans, yakusan, stilyagi, anderumpter,
provos, beatniks, hippies and other
groups ' labelled by new words in
almost every language. All this
points to the alienation, isolation and
escapism felt by part of modern youth.
No matter how different they may

appear on the surface, these pheno¬
mena share a common trait: they show
how this segment of youth rejects the
values of present-day society.
The public has heard a great deal
about juvenile delinquency pver the
past fifteen years. It has been blamed
on a number of causes: underemploy¬
ment or unemployment, poor housing,
schools not adapted to their pupils, or
the influence of certain films and
publications. But .the public often
fails to recognize it for what it really
is: a collective phenomenon generated
by youth's inability to adapt and also
a symptom of the anxiety of young
people and the open violence they are
tempted to wield against society.
Student revolt is only the newest
form of contestation. Its themes and
aspects are not the same in highly-
industrialized as they are in developing
countries. They differ, too, in Asia,
Africa, Europe or Latin America as well
as in terms of each country's social
and economic structure. But the
spread of student revolt certainly
proves the great anxiety dwelling in
university youth throughout the world.
In the 1967-68 school year alone,
protest movements and
demonstrations (certainly of
seriousness) appeared in
of countries throughout the
revolts,
student
varying
dozens
world.
Alongside social and political pro¬
tests or general discontent, many
student groups have expressed their
desire to reform university curricula
and to restructure universities. They
want to participate in their education,
they demand an end to the artificial
barriers between the rôle of the
student and that of the teacher.
Everyone, they say, must take an
active part in the educational process
while everyone becomes both an
educator and an "educatee".
They insist on changes in the
content of university education to
make it pay more heed to youth's real
concerns in all fields whether cultural,
personal, social, political or pro¬
fessional. They start by criticizing the
university; in many cases, they end
with the idea of a "critical university".
Finally, they seek to change the style
of life in the universities themselves.
In other words, a growing proportion
of modern youth feels a malaise
whether they are college or secondary
school students, young workers or
rural youth. They want "freer, franker
and warmer human relations than what
they get from us." They are afraid
that "the national and international
system into which they are being
driven contains grave injustices to
which they do not want to be party."

YOUTH IN FERIV.ENT (Continued)
The crisis
Poking fun at and showing irreverence
for famous national heroes seems
to excite many young people
today though it often shocks their
parents. Mere, a hippie convention
in Chicago congregates around and
on the equestrian statue of General
Ulysses Grant, commander in chief of
the Union army in the American
Civil War, and 18th president of the
United States (from 1868 to 1875).
I ANY young people have
dropped out of society and do not
seem very interested in climbing back
in. But the great mass is eager to
gain more awareness of society's
problems and to help solve them
according to its own lights. Here,
young people display a yearning for
emancipation at an early age not
emancipation in its legal sense as
achievement of adult status but as a
way of becoming the equal of adults
in terms of rights and freedoms while
remaining true to themselves.
This trend had already been under¬
lined by the International Conference
on Youth, organized by Unesco in
Grenoble (France) in August 1964:
"Whereas it was once thought that
young people had no other function
than to prepare themselves for later
life, it is now realized that they want,
and ought, to take part in political and
social life very early and to assume
their place in the community as soon
as possible. That -is why young
people must be integrated into society
and considered as young adults, not
as growing children. They must
shoulder their responsibilities and be
helped to do so."
Many young people refuse to par¬
ticipate in public life but many more
insist on their rights to do so. This
demand derives not only from an
interest in public life but also because
they regard it as a prerequisite for
winning the rights, still the privilege
of adults, that will enable them to break
away from their status as minors.
Youth's need to participate in public
life is gaining wider recognition. In
certain cases, it is somewhat satisfied
by systems of self-government or "co-
government" within certain countries
local administrations and occasionally
even in traditional rural communities,
co-operatives, advisory bodies, etc.
Young people have mixed attitudes
about active participation in public life.
Sometimes they demand broader and
more effective participation within
existing structures, then try to render
them more efficient and democratic.
At other times, they refuse to parti
cipate even when given the chance.
They are afraid that if they "sold out"
to the Establishment they would lose
their dynamism and their influence as
a protest group.
It is true that a permanent dialogue
is needed with youth but it is also
true that such a dialogue can be
fruitful only if it influences decision¬
making bodies. Youth occasionally
feel that willingness to talk conceals a
total lack of willingness to share the
power of decision-making.
Helping to solve their own problems.
More and more often, secondary
school children above a certain age
and especially college students insist
on participating in the formulation of
curricula. Youth want to lend a hand
to the shaping of new university
structures and in devising new ways
to give examinations and select
students.
Even student extremists do not seem
to be trying to take the reins of
authority away from the teachers but
simply to find a common ground for

discussion, using simpler and more
human forms of communication. This
is conscious and responsible participa¬
tion: it is spreading student govern¬
ment beyond classrooms into the
lunchrooms, dormitories and general
disciplinary machinery of secondary
schools.
All this holds true for many young
workers who want to "participate" in
their own training. They must acquire
the knowledge and the attitudes they
need to be flexible enough to meet
the demands of modern industry.
They must be able to organize and
protect their jobs, as well as their
leisure.
Rural youth can participate in co¬
operatives, young farmers' clubs and
institutions that give them a dignified
role in the modernization of agriculture.
Such participation can lead to a
strengthening and rejuvenation of
rural communities.
In this respect, we find youth
organizations and institutions besieged
by their members" demands for more
responsibilities and opportunities for
direct action. More and more young
people have more and more places
where they can meet clubhouses,
centres and halls that the government
and adult organizations open for them.
But whenever they feel that these
clubs and centres really do not belong
to them, boys and girls prefer to meet
in a place a café, a dance hail-
where they feel they can talk freely
away from the adult world. Just about
everywhere, they are groping for a
way to run the centres set up for them.
Finally, young people want to lead
their own lives with the leisure to help
solve their own problems. Whether
in sports, cultural activities, holidays
or travel, they seek to express them¬
selves in activities that they have
chosen and organized on their own.
Participation in international life.
There is no denying the sad fact that
many do not care about world affairs.
In conflicts, their attitude is often "a
plague on both your houses." As for
international organizations, they ignore
their existence and some are particu¬
larly sceptical about the United Nations
and its agencies.
Nevertheless, youth on the whole are
growing more and more interested in
world affairs, perhaps because the
world is in crisis. Systems of
values are collapsing in industrialized
societies, conflicts arise between
societies with different social and eco¬
nomic systems; developing countries
face tragic problems, the entire world
is gripped in the fear of nuclear
death . . .
To a large number of young people,
all this is totally irrational. It stirs
their need to "change the world."
Apparently, they do not "adapt" nearly
as well as adults to the international
tensions, conflicts and injustices of
the modern world.
Despite the existence of certain
nationalist movements, young people
are still the world's strongest
supporters of international under¬
standing. They do not regard it as
just a theory, either. More and more

### 57834: Youth in ferment

YOUTH IN FERMENT (Continued)
Towards a new partnership with youth
12
protests against wars are being made
more and more loudly. Voluntary
movements have burgeoned so rapidly
in recent years that the supply far
outstrips the demand at present.
Youth organizations are more and
more eager to co-operate vith inter¬
national institutions, bringing massive
and enthusiastic support to their
programmes. Examples can be found
in solid backing by youth of program¬
mes aimed against illiteracy and
hunger and of International rescue
campaigns after natural disasters.
Finally, it is certain that networks
offering youth a permanent exchange
system have helped usher In new
youth solidarity on an international
scale.
Youth are eager and ready to parti¬
cipate in international solidarity to
build a world where human rights,
peace and brotherhood will not be
merely words in "charters" but bases
for ways of life and action. It is true
that present-day misunderstandings,
tensions and contradictions in inter¬
national life are reflected by youth
activities at this level, but it is also true
that youth everywhere are extremely
close to those ideals and principles
that the world community keeps
proclaiming, all too often in vain.
In particular, youth organizations are
trying to participate more intensively
not only in the execution but in the
preparation of the programmes of
international organizations. They really
have not yet been given a chance to
do so. Organizations must become
aware of this trend and make room
for youth whose support and parti¬
cipation can strengthen their world
rôle.
How the situation is viewed. Some
see today's youth unrest as "nothing
new". They call it just another facet
of a problem as old as history that
will exist as long as generations clash
and youth remain ill-adapted to
society.
Others charge that youth escalate
their impulses into violence all too
readily without knowing where they
are going ... or where they would like
to go. If youth reject paternalism,
they are called presumptuous, in¬
tolerant and incompetent. If they
break a lance against technocracy,
they are accused of getting drunk on
their own words. If they turn against
conformity and the powers-that-be,
they are told they are irresponsible,
futile and unaware of things that really
matter. If they denounce the debasing
and alienating effects of commer¬
cialism as they turn their backs on the
affluent society, they are called
spoiled brats.
At one extreme of public opinion,
there is an attitude that just about
affirms that the whole youth crisis is
"artificial" and that their revolt is
simply dictated from within by their
own status and hopes.
Another attitude consists of con¬
sidering the youth movement as
isolated with its own laws and outside
our overall social context. This does
not fit the evidence of recent years
that have seen youth, like adults,
refuse to remain on the same side all
the time. They can oppose their own
social group, yet conform to it. They
can seek and find allies or strong¬
holds in another -social group, then
adopt its mode of behaviour. Youth
and adults still seem permanently
linked and, despite superficial ap¬
pearances, no one can describe the
present situation in terms of "father-
and-son struggles".
Nevertheless, many adults are
astounded by the scope of the youth
movement and the forms it has
assumed. They lock the barn door
after the horse has been stolen: they
reproach themselves for not having
paid enough attention to youth's
demands, they take genuine interest
in the causes of its dissatisfaction and
they try to meet its contestation fairly.
It is at this point that we realize how
modern youth are helping to bring out
new social and moral values. They are
right to bare the flaws, the evils and
the vileness of a civilization that they
refuse to accept as such. In many
respects, youth's new ways of action
are healthy ways. They help give new
forms of expression to the reaction
against outdated social and political
structures. In particular, the adult
world realizes that educational systems
can be reformed and renovated only
with the participation of youth.
At another extreme lie outspoken
advocates of "student power" who
regard youth as an infallible judge of
intellectual aberrations and social
iniquities. Youth can do no wrong,
they say, and praise their "absolute
progressivism". The most tangible
result of all this zeal has been to turn
many adults against all youthful
progressives and to stir unwarranted
suspicion and hostility against the true
aspects of the youth movement.
Origins and causes of the crisis.
Explanations of the origins and causes
of the present crisis can be ranked
under two main headings. Some
think all this is of no great importance
and that it will go away. Others feel
that we are confronted by a crisis
affecting society as a whole or, at
least, by a profound social problem.
One explanation under the first
heading holds that tensions are created
by the failure of outdated traditional
institutions to meet the demands of
modernization. The explosions we
are witnessing are said to be an
expression of these tensions, and a
welcome expression, too: it leads to
reforms that will remedy causes and
thereby eliminate their effects.
From this viewpoint, such pheno¬
mena as youth's alienation, refusal
or revolt are nothing more than the
fits and starts we always experience
when we move from one society to
another: in this case, from pre-
industrial to industrial societies based
on rationality.
Other snap judgements call youth's
crisis a case of temporary exasperation
that shows such typical juvenile
symptoms as turbulence, naivete and
utopianism. Or else, in an even
grosser oversimplification, the more or
less serious course of events is not
supposed to be based on the objective
existence of any problems at all but
simply on candour and ignorance
displayed by a certain sector of
modern youth.
As for serious explanations, they
agree that society is witnessing a
crisis or is in a state of crisis itself,
but they differ considerably over the
nature of its causes. We hear of the
crisis of youth's integration into
modern societies, the urgent need for
various sorts of mutations in different
types of societies, the necessity to

## [Page 13](078375engo.pdf#page=13) 0

### 57834: Youth in ferment

break away from conservatism in a
given situation, the crisis faced by the
"consumers' society"; the crisis of
ways of life, of values, of civilization
itself.
All these views imply that youth are
particularly sensitive to society's evils.
The idea of clear-sighted youth in a
blind and aging world leads to the
most dramatic hypothesis of all: the
phase we are now undergoing will
lead the world either to inevitable
agony or to rebirth.
Interpretations are split between two
basic views of the national and inter¬
national dimensions of the youth
crisis. The first holds that problems
vary so widely from one country to
another that they offer neither
similarity nor analogy nor correlation.
The second, on the contrary,
maintains that this is a general trend
whose universality is based upon
youth's feeling everywhere that man¬
kind is undergoing a crisis brought on
by chaos and threats. It is also based
on the international nature of youth
culture which makes various move¬
ments more permeable and contagious.
Differences among youth's situations
ideals, goals, demands and methods
In different countries cannot be
denied. Nor, however, can anyone
deny that there are similarities and
common denominators among activ¬
ities and events far removed from
each other and apparently distinct.
This aspect is particularly important for
international organizations.
Threefold approach to the problem.
More and more countries are trying to
take practical steps to help youth,
create facilities adapted to their needs
and develop activities organized by
youth themselves and their institutions.
However, one cannot help but wonder
under present circumstances if exist¬
ing facilities, steps and activities will
be equal to the problem. At the
current pace of events, there may
well be a gap at the practical level
between means and needs, between
efforts and problems.
Three different tendencies have
appeared at the national level. The
first is to create governmental or
quasi-governmental groups to take
care of youth problems. The second
is to develop or intensify self-govern¬
ment by youth within the institutions
that serve it. The third is to develop
ind spread the network of commer
cially-operated activities aimed at
meeting youth's leisure needs.
More and more countries are trying
to work out a "youth policy" composed
of a series of legislative, social, educ¬
ational and financial steps. While
pro-youth measures in the past were
usually unco-ordinated and dispersed,
the present tendency runs towards
overall national policies for children
and youth.
Many governments have taken both
long-term measures that must be
carried out empirically and emergency
steps that require improvisation. The
relative ineffectiveness of these
measures has several causes: ignor¬
ance of youth's hopes, insufficient
links among various camps within the
youth movement, faulty conception,
over-rigid structures or, on the con¬
trary, too much hemming and hawing.
Finally, there is the simple lack of
money which, in many cases, has been
responsible for mediocrity and lack of
continuity.
Among practical steps deserving
particular attention should be mention¬
ed school education, out-of-school
education and activities aimed at
enlisting youth into the development
of their country or community.
At the risk of repeating a truism,
one must stress that school and
university education wield the broad¬
est and deepest influence of all on
youth. It, too, is the sector that
receives by far the greatest financial
and intellectual support from govern¬
ments. In recent years, education has
enjoyed unprecedented expansion
throughout the world. Educational
investment is growing faster than
national incomes.
Both the basis and the corollary of
this development, the spread of
education offers benefits while creat¬
ing new problems. Expansion of
education has stimulated research in
pedagogy, generated administrative
reforms, brought about new relation¬
ships between the school and the
"environment," and started a move¬
ment to renovate methods. It is
encouraging to note that this trend
is growing stronger thanks to the
support it has received.
As for out-of-school activities, there
are two striking facts: the constant
increase in activities, institutions and
resources on the one hand, and, on
the other, the relative inadequacy and
inefficiency of these activities. Re
form of school education and official
teaching methods is not enough. At
the same time, youth's out-of-school
activities must help strengthen the
democratic, creative, dynamic and
living nature of education as a whole.
It is to be hoped, particularly In the
present circumstances, that out-of-
school education will help renovate
in-school education, revamp teaching
methods that have remained archaic
all too often and revise curricula
whose authoritarian, unrealistic and
encyclopaedic nature is denounced so
frequently and " so accurately by
students.
As youth feel their oats, society
becomes aware of their importance:
youth, an indispensable human re¬
source, must be mobilized if develop¬
ment is to be speeded. Countries
eager to modernize and to maintain
their economic growth rate therefore
tend to turn to young minds more
receptive to modern techniques and
more likely to spawn new ideas. In
many developing countries, special
offices have been created for this
purpose along with voluntary organiz¬
ations and the necessary legislation.
Twenty-eight countries (1), to our
knowledge, have set up national youth
services for economic and social
development which mobilize young
people for a year or two between the
end of their adolescence and the
start of their adult lives.
In other countries (2) where similar
services are performed by private
bodies, legislation has been passed
to integrate their activities Into
development plans. Official status,
for example, has been given the work
of the Company of Young Canadians
which supports and carries out pro¬
grammes aimed at social, economic
and community development. Other
examples are the Education Service
and the Health Service in Iran (both
voluntary) that try to improve rural
living conditions, or Volunteers in
Service to America (VISTA) which
offers young and old alike a chance

to work in social programmes aimed
at urban slums, rural poverty belts
and Indian reservations.
A genuine partnership. One must
face facts, however: in its present
form, this appeal to the generosity of
the young often tends to use them,
to mobilize them as involuntary
"volunteers." Ideally, it should be
based on civic spirit or solidarity and
it certainly should give youth a say
in the process of development which,
after all, will determine their future.
It is equally obvious that youth
can play such a rôle only in a system
that enables them to take a hand both
in the preparation and the execution
of plans as full-fledged participants.
Youth will be true partners only when
they win the right to express their
opinions about plans for national
growth and development and the
methods to be used. The result will
not be just more "youth power" for
development but easier integration of
youth into society as a whole. Here,
the idea is not to try to outwit youth
but to lay new foundations for an
authentic youth policy.
Although practical approaches and
operational steps have yet to be fully
analyzed, one can already point to
some obvious flaws.
First of all, youth programmes are all
too often undertaken without any real
knowledge of youth, their problems,
behaviour and the tendencies that make
them run. Why? Because no one
strikes that Indispensable balance
between thought and action, between
practical measures and scientific study
of situations and problems.
Secondly, there Is the inflexibility
of certain social structures or the
burden of tradition weighing down
on activities intended for youth.
Occasionally, too, society acts slowly
or even fearfully when confronted by
youth's needs and The
result is that institutions cannot adapt
dynamically to situations and, instead,
remain crippled by outmoded forms.
Last and certainly not least, policies,
programmes and practical approaches
are all too often conceived and carried
out for youth, rather than by and with
youth.
The present crisis will be vanquished
only if such a state of mind is
changed. For it is not just a "youth
crisis" but, to a large extent, a crisis
in society's concern over its youth.

The students' revolt which struck France in May, 1968 set off
a chain reaction which spread throughout Europe and to other
parts of the world. Student irregulars, like this young
demonstrator, waged pitched battles in the streets of Paris.

### 57880: The Angry generation

THE ANGRY
GENERATION
by Marcel Hicfer
We publish below major portions of a remarkable
study on European youth today, prepared for the Council
of Europe in Strasbourg by Marcel Hicter, Director-General
for Youth and Leisure at the Belgian Ministry of Culture.
Although it deals chiefly with youth in Western Europe,
the breadth and scope of this penetrating analysis is highly
pertinent for readers in every part of the world.
A,i DULTS can hardly be so
hypocritical as to pretend that the
present revolt of youth has come as-
a surprise or that it has caught them
unawares. The writing on the wall, in
more ways than one, has been clear
for some time.
Rare are the industrialized societies
that have not had their share of youth
violence and turmoil. Thirteen years
ago, Stockholm witnessed the tragic
events of Christmas 1956 when the
city's youth went on a rampage. Even
at that time people scratched their
heads and asked themselves how it
was possible for such a thing to happen
In the economically most advanced
country of Europe.
Many volumes have since been
written to explain that young people
are bored, attributing this variously to
the fact that they have everything they
need or want, to a lack of morality or
religion, to excessive sexual freedom,
to the abdication of parents, etc. etc.
The Stockholm events were soon
followed by other eruptions that rocked
almost every major city. There was
the night in June 1963 when 150,000
shrieking, frenzied youngsters filled
the Place de la Nation in Paris, goaded
on by their teenage idols.
Almost at the same time we saw
the birth of the new teenage gangs,
with their "teddy boys", "mods" and
"rockers" in England, their "nozum"
in the Netherlands, their "halbstarke"
in Germany (Fed. Rep.) and their

by Unesco at Grenoble, France, in 1964.
"vitelloni" in Italy. These bands took
on various forms and were constantly
changing, but they all were evidence
of the rejection of a society which had
failed to integrate its youth.
This was followed by the rise of
completely new industries which
concocted a "youth culture" catering
exclusively to the younger generations
who had the money to buy the gadgets
and other products specially produced
for them. This youth culture rejected
the adult world and the adult rationale;
it stressed change and novelty in cloth¬
ing and other apparel, initiation rites,
the cult of speed and violence, the
thrill of being "with it", and the teen¬
age idols instead of the time-honoured
heroes (James Dean, West Side Story,
etc.).
Adults felt strange in this new world
of "young" music, "young" records,
"young" clothing, "young" hairstyles,
"young" cigarettes, "young" drinks,
the "young" look, etc. Radio and TV
stations were literally invaded by
advertising programmes trumpeting the
new mood. And the world was
divided between the teenage "in-
group" and the old fogey "out-group".
All this was the work of adults who
looked upon youth as just one big
potential market. And it is saddening
to reflect that the first important
surveys of youth carried out in Europe
were actually market studies.
Meanwhile, however, other move¬
ments were also taking shape. These
were more complex, more intellectual,
more artistic. There was the extra¬
ordinary movement of "Angry Young
Men" in literature and the theatre in
Britain which represented an authentic
opposition to the industrial society
rationale.
In the United States, too, university
and artistic circles saw the birth of
the Beatniks whose ranks included a
number of first-rate poets and novelists
of protest and dissent. Unfortunately
this movement was soon swamped by
a host of imitators who adopted the
Beatniks' nonconformist attire but little
else.
It was in Holland, however, that the
most interesting movement (socio¬
logically speaking) sprang up. This
was the "Provo" group and the
"Provotariat" idea which rapidly spread
to neighbouring countries but with
much of its original force and vigour
lost.
The Provos did not reject all of
society's basic premises nor did they
hesitate to advocate changes in our
industrial civilization. In fact one of
their members was even elected to
the Amsterdam Municipal Council.
Their leader was a thinker and
philosopher, and the group campaigned
(alongside adults) against air and
water pollution, the threat to historical
and artistic buildings, and for a more
social and humane rôle of the police
in society as guardians of children and
supervisors of sports fields.
But most of all they attacked the
hypocrisy of adult society which
allows millions of children to die of
hunger while the manufacture of
nuclear weapons goes on and the
Vietnam war continues.
There can be little doubt that the
war in Vietnam has been the most
important single factor contributing to
"the broad hostility of youth." The
Vietnam war has given rise to many
university seminars which, out of
opposition, then embarked on different
interpretations of Marxian thought, as
well as to mass national demonstra¬
tions (as in Belgium) where all youth
organizations joined in anti-Bomb mar¬
ches or the condemnation of the Viet¬
nam war. 1 C

tenets of society, culture and the
university rationale itself. One cannot
omit at least a mention here of the
Chinese Cultural Revolution and the
International Strasbourg Movement,
with its manifesto "On Human Misery",
which attracted considerable attention
and study at the University of Nan-
terre, which in turn sparked the great
student revolts of France in May of
last year.
But it was from the University of
California at Berkeley, with its great
intellectual tradition, that there emerged
the type of dissent that foreshadowed
the student revolts which swept the
world in 1968. Robert Kennedy, in a
speech delivered in Philadelphia on
February 24, 1967, analyzed the
situation very carefully. He quoted
the declaration of the militant student
leader of the Berkeley University
Council which heralds the events to
come and already points to the inter¬
national character of the university
revolt:
"We asked to be heard. You re¬
fused. We asked for justice. You
called it anarchy. We asked for
freedom. You called it licence.
Rather than do something about the
fear and despair you created, you
called it communism. You accused
us of not using legal channels. But
you have closed those channels.
You, not we, have built a university
founded on suspicion and dis¬
honesty."
Then came the "hippie" culture which
everyone now knows about. Again it
was California that sparked the move¬
ment. Tens of thousands of young¬
sters, challenging the affluent society
which most of them were part of,
abandoned their families to flock
together as a community. The flower,
non-violence, sex and pacifism were
their insignia as well as non-action
the refusal of all action withdrawal,
and the venture into LSD and mari¬
juana.
Over the past ten years countless
books and studies have been available
to adults on the Industrial society, the
consumer society, the affluent society,
and the civilization of leisure. And
their authors have come forward with
suggestions and proposals for meeting
the new situations we are living in.
In France there were the works of
Georges Friedmann, Raymond Aaron,
Edgar Morin, Robert Escarpit, Roland
Barthes, Michel Crozier, Jean Fouras-
tié, Jean Dumazedier, H. Lefebvre,
A. Moles. In Germany (Fed. Rep.),
those of Th. Adorno, E. Feldmann, H. M.
Enzensberger, etc. In Italy, the studies
by the Agostino Ganelli Institute. But
above all, there were the works of the
great American sociologists, who five
good years before Europe, had already
produced their agonizing appraisals.
Men such as P. Lazarsfeld, D. Ries-
man, J. Galbraith, and in more recent
years, Herbert Marcuse and the
Canadian, Marshall McLuhan.
In addition to various White Papers
and Special Reports on youth, we
adults also had access to the extensive
critical research carried out by the
universities themselves on the need
and urgency of university reforms.
The round tables at Caen and
Amiens Universities are two of the
most famous examples. Here some of
France's greatest professors set a
notable example of analysis, self-
criticism and "contestation". In
Brussels, too, it was the faculty
members and research staff who set
off the student protest movement.
And more than ten years ago it was
the Vice-Chancellor of the University
of Nancy, Jean Capelle, who launched
the now famous and oft-repeated
words "the curriculum has gone mad"
(les programmes démentiels).
Why have we failed to understand
what has happened? Or are we just
pretending we don't understand?
IF we analyze this highly
complex situation objectively we will
find that it is after all a kind of conflict
of generations, perhaps the first of the
many violent encounters between the
younger and older generations that
certain sociologists tell us will replace
the old class struggle. In any event
it is quite obvious that the student's
approach is basically forward-looking
while the reaction of adults is naturally
conservative.
We are living in an aging society
where the proportion of old people is
growing in the top echelon posts of
government, university faculties, the
civil service, management and industry,
commerce and agriculture. Often
these older people no longer have the
mental, psychological or physical drive
needed both to keep up to date today
and to gear their lives and actions
to tomorrow.
Even men in their fifties are not as
forward-looking as one may think.
During the Second World War they
were about twenty years old, and in
Europe at least, many exerted all their
energies on the battlefield or in under¬
ground activities, or else spent years
in concentration camps. Today they
are proud of the way they rebuilt
their countries, their homes, schools
and industries, and created a society
in which the standard of living and
comfort is generally very high Indeed.
They look with satisfaction at the way
these standards are steadily rising and
social justice is on the increase.
Citizens of Germany (Fed. Rep.) who
are 50 years old now are especially
proud of having built up the first really
democratic society their country has
ever known, and which has lasted a
generation. They are especially proud
of having reintegrated their country
fully into Western Europe within the
short space of 20 years. And now
what do they find? Their children
are condemning the affluent society,
condemning their democracy, the
whole social system... and the univer¬
sities which are supposed to train them
to run the society that they, their
50 years-old parents look on with such
pride.
The universalization of culture.
Let us try to understand. What is it
that has actually changed in the
space of one generation. And what
has been affected by this speed up
in change?

out that a process of universalization
is now shaping culture and youth's
future everywhere. I recalled the
words of the Belgian sociologist,
Henri Janne:
"Any event of any importance or
considered likely to be so is now
instantly transmitted to hundreds of
millions of people in every corner of
the globe . . . There Is now no event
no matter where It occurs, that does
not touch others. Economic inter¬
dependence is a fact, and everyone is

can no longer claim ignorance about
the poverty of the developing countries
and these countries in turn, as they
view our riches, no doubt find
our problems concerning the social
distribution of wealth petty If not
shocking.
"For the first time in history the
human species has become conscious
of its unity. Today's problems have
meaning only in relation to man seen
not as some abstraction but as the
concrete, living actuality of all mankind.
The nation, however mighty it may be,
is still drawn to the scale of the
cannon, the tank and the internal
combustion engine, that is, to the so-
calJed 'conventional weapons'. But
today's scale is that of the jet engine,
the H-bomb and the rocket, i.e. the
global scale of all mankind."
Mass Communication & Mass
Culiure. The world-wide extension
of information has gone hand in hand
with the acceleration of communica¬
tions. This is the age of mass
communications and mass culture
where the youngsters of today are the
first generation that has grown up with
the TV screen from early childhood.
For most adults the chief, if not the
only, window on the world was the
classroom, but only a small fraction of
today's youngsters' experience now
originates in the school.
Since infancy the young generations
have been bombarded by a stream of
images and sounds from their tele¬
vision- sets with one piece of infor¬
mation very rapidly replaced by still
newer information, fragmented. In bits
and snippets and unconnected. There
is no opportunity for analysis or calm
reasoning on the part of the young
TV viewer.
K An important book has just been
published by A. Moles, entitled Socio-
dynamique de la Culture, which paints
an alarming picture of contemporary
man (and youth) subjected to mass
communications. Moles shows how
man has abandoned the hierarchical
structures that permitted him to
classify newly-acquired knowledge,
and sees the brain reduced to a felt¬
like substance held together only by
the compression of many loose, inter¬
locking fibres arranged in a helter-
skelter jumble of total disorder.
Since 1962 Professor Marshall
McLuhan of the University of Toronto
has thrown a bombshell into our
thinking about society with his book
on the end of The Gutenberg Galaxy,
followed in 1964 by his Understanding
Media and in 1967 by The Medium is
the Massage. McLuhan maintains that
our society, based on linear forms of
print, shaped a culture of the eye and
of reason (man saw life as he saw
print as a continuity which enabled
him to arrange his ideas and think in
isolation). But the environment that
man creates becomes his medium for
defining his rôle in it. With the
advent of the "electric technology" of
mass communication and especially
television, we are leaving the age of
reason to enter a new moral age with
the world transformed into "a global
village" of retribalized life.
From these studies it looks as if
there is not just a difference of
quality but of nature between the
mental make-up of young people and
my own mental make-up as an adult.
This would prevent any serious
dialogue through lack of a common
manner of thinking and reasoning.
I hope I am wrong about this but the
coincidence worries me.
The Industrial Conditioning of
Minds. But adults have something
else just as serious to worry about.
H. Magnus Eisenaberger's book
Culture ou mise en condition? (Culture
or conditioning?) should be read by
everyone, particularly his analysis of
the industrial shaping of minds, a

Like a giant kaleidoscope, images of
every kind and from every corner of
the globe twist and tumble before
the eyes of today's youth the first
generation that has grown up in
front of the TV screen. For modern
youth the picture is worth not a
thousand but a hundred thousand
words. According to one school of
thought, the new media of mass
communication are reshaping patterns
of social interdependence and every
aspect of our personal life. They are
making us reconsider and re-evaluate
practically every thought, every
action, and every institution formerly
taken for granted.

phenomenon which has known an
extraordinary development in the last
hundred years. Eisensberger writes:
"While people passionately argue
about the new technical media, radio,
cinema, TV, the record industry, pro¬
paganda, advertising, and public
relations as separate entities, the
industry of mind fashioning seen as a
whole Is actually neglected .. .We do
not seem to realize that mind con¬
ditioning has not yet reached its peak
development, that it has yet to gain
control of its most important medium,
i.e. education.
"The industrialization of education is
a very recent phenomenon which has
barely begun. While we continue to
discuss such things as class sched¬
ules, school systems, the shortage of
teachers and maximum use of school
space, the new technical media which
make nonsense of any debate on
educational reform are already on our
doorstep.
"Industrial mind conditioning is as
prevalent in capitalist as in communist
countries. It makes little difference
whether it operates under State, public
or private control. Everywhere- its
aim is 'to perpetuate the existing
patterns, inculcate a certain way of
thinking, and then to manipulate and
exploit It." The exploitation of minds,
either overt or subconscious, serves
as a smoke screen for physical
exploitation, resulting in spiritual
degradation, a loss of political faculties
and the subjection of the masses to
the ever-powerful control of the few.
"The rapid development of industrial
mind-conditioning and its integration
into the very fabric of modern society
is transforming the rôle of the in¬
tellectual. The intellectual now finds
himself exposed to new dangers, and
a totally new and subtle type of
corruption and blackmail. Voluntarily
or not, consciously or unconsciously,
he is becoming the accomplice of
an industry which needs him for sur¬
vival just as he now needs it, but
whose purposes (the consolidation of
established authority) are incompatible
with his own. Here we are at the
threshold, if not at the heart, of a world
of psychological violence."
A world of violence. The violence
which surrounds us is a cause for real
alarm, for it represents a challenge
to civilization itself. Not that violence
was unknown in former times. It was
often a daily occurrence. But in the
present age of man's increasing
mastery over nature and of scientific
progress, an age where respect for
life is inculcated In us from early
childhood, violence has become an
incomprehensible anachronism.
The Centre for the Study of
Contemporary Civilization, at the
University of Nice, has just published
the proceedings of a symposium on
Violence in the Present-Day World
(Desclée de Brouwer, Publishers,
1968), the table of contents of which
makes grim reading: tensions and
distortions in contemporary humanism,
violence and immorality, terrorism and
psychological violence, violence in the
theatre, literature, cinema, television;
violence and social conflict; violence
in the Third World; violence and the
American Negro; World War II, nuclear
weapons; international violence, etc . . .
I quote a few lines from a text by
Jean Onimus who outlines some of the
newer facets of contemporary violence:
"Paradoxically, violence has reached
such a stage of shocking cynicism and
refinement during the past 30 years
that the cruelty of the most brutal
periods of history pales in comparison:
torture, scientifically organized geno¬
cide, persecutions of every kind, the

"Every civilization has had its
demons and its angels. But its
demons were not necessarily
millionaires and manufacturers
of fiction and fantasy. Sooner
or later, the dream factory
operates on its most lucrative
resources: sex and bloodshed."
André Malraux
mass deportation of populations, the
crushing of defenceless victims or
entire nations under the heel of
oppression, the revival of the most
inhuman forms of terrorism, and
finally, the threat of atomic war and
the so-called balance of terror.
"Like a giant tide, violence Is rising
and sweeping towards the horizon of
tomorrow, threatening to engulf the
benefits of progress in a wave of
destruction or total annihilation.
"In fact, as our society has moved
toward greater and greater technology,
it has given impetus to new forms of
physical and moral brutality which now
include the invasion of the right to
privacy, brain washing, the manipula¬
tion of men's minds and all kinds of
pressures that bluntly challenge and
threaten our freedoms.
"When we look at the political,
economic and racial tensions that
plague this planet of ours as it
awakens to a new consciousness, and
then consider the host of powerful new
weapons of conquest and domination
made available by modern science, we
can desperately ask ourselves whether
the circle of violence has not snapped
shut around us, finally and irrevocably,
so that no appeal to world conscience
can ever hope to break it again.
"But these savage, brutal types of
violence are not the only ones now
threatening us. More dangerous
because less obvious are those cunning
methods of indoctrination and condi¬
tioning which, with seeming gentleness
and subtle play upon our motivations,
seek to shackle us .with Invisible
bonds. The unwary person, dis¬
concerted by the complications of
modern living and overwhelmed by the
pressure of the persuaders applied at
the same time to both the nobler and
baser feelings, becomes just a pawn
who can be victimized all the more
easily in that he thinks he is gaining
freedom.
"This insidious kind of violence is
barely perceptible. Yet Its damage is
much more profound since it catches
people off guard and ensnares their
goodwill. To guard against it calls for
permanent alertness and vigilance
which is beyond the capacity of most
people.
"Here, perhaps, lies the most
ominous threat for the near future.
Overt forms of violence bring their
own immediate reaction; but the under¬
cover type wedges its way in with
the blessing of its victims. It can be
detected only in the advantages It
brings to those who manipulate it."
IHE youth population ex¬
plosion has, of course, had an imme¬
diate impact on school budgets and
equipment, but it has also profoundly
marked life and the atmosphere on the
campus. In one generation, French
university student enrolment soared
from 50,000 to 600,000, and in Belgium
from 10,000 to 60,000. Any university
that has to cope with 100,000 students
simply cannot organize student-
professor-administration relationships
on a genuinely human level.
At the University of Liège, Belgium,
where the population growth has been
average, Professor Fernand Desonay
points out that there were only five
senior year students of philosophy and
literature in 1930, but 1,384 students
took the exams in 1965 as anonymous
entities of indifference and chance.
Jean-Paul Sartre wrote recently,
"There were 25 of us in our class at
the Ecole Normale Supérieure, few
enough for us not to feel stifled. It
was an ¡deal situation; we could
discuss freely with the professor and
there was continual disagreement and
dissent, but it all took place in an
atmosphere of aristocratic leisure.
Today, things are completely different.
There are so many students that they
cannot communicate directly with the
professors as we could. Many
students never even see the professor.
His voice reaches them through a
loudspeaker, dehumanized, remote,
intoning a lecture that, as far as they
are concerned, holds absolutely no
interest for them."
The problem is rooted in the univer¬
sity population explosion, student
dissatisfaction with the present state
of education (which has spread from
the social science faculties to all the
others), and the devaluation of univer¬
sity diplomas. This has given rise to
a new proletariat-like student body,
armed with far more explosive
weapons than the working class ever
had to protect its interests and future.
Gone are the days when the univer¬
sity graduate automatically exchanged
his cap and gown for a pre-ordained
position as a leader in the community.
Student problems, acute though
they are, form only a part of an infin¬
itely more general situation which goes
beyond the university. Writing in
the French Education Nationale (20 June
1968), Robert Mandra asked whether
the traditional causes of unrest among
young people are not traditional
causes which no longer produce the
same effects because of the large
numbers of young people involved.
He compares the situation to physics
where a quantitative change results in
a qualitative change, and sees the vast
number of students challenging the
order of importance of human prob¬
lems.
In the stable society of past
centuries, it was generally accepted
that a person went into the world
with a certain amount of knowledge
which was then matured by exper¬
ience; then as the individual got older
he was given increased responsibilities.
In today's world of modern science,
medicine and technology, we have
replaced "knowledge and experience"
with "knowledge and creativity".
Invention, innovation and new attitudes
are so much more important to the
youth of today that it could almost be
said that experience handicaps the
adult who is like a smoker who "keeps
used matches to light future cigar¬
ettes".
Nowadays, when young people
between 25 and 40 are playing an
increasing rôle as trailblazers in almost
every field of human activity, we must
radically revise our thinking to enable
youth to come to the fore while
allowing those over 50 to assume
continuous, long term operations.
But this situation is tricky since
other equally important factors have
to be considered. Along with the
change in the age pattern of society
there are biological and sociological
changes and, perhaps even changes
in the mental structure of youth.
Changing social function of youth.
Paul Sivadon, professor at the Univer¬
sity of Brussels and president of the
European League for Mental Health,
who has made a highly original
contribution to the study of youth,
points out that the period of adoles¬
cence is growing longer, not shorter.
Formerly the transition from childhood ft .
to adulthood took place in a few y1
months: it now takes 10 years. While *
this prolonged adolescence may enable
youngsters to compare and experiment

THE ANGRY GENERATION (Continued)
with different and often contradictory
standards of conduct before working
out their own moral code, it also
prolongs the period of no-decision-
taking and the Inclination to live in a
dream world of unreality.
A generation or two ago, the great
majority of boys had decided on their
careers by the time they were 15; now
many "adolescents" of 25 still haven't
made up their minds.- Twenty-six per
cent of boys and 50 per cent of girls
finish secondary school not knowing
what profession to enter. This has
created the situation where more and
more young couples, even those with
children, are entirely dependent on
their parents for support.
Young people are now biologically
mature earlier than their predecessors
but it takes them longer to achieve
social independence.
"There have always been conflicts
between the generations, student
revolts and violent youth groups,"
Professor Sivadon has written, "but
the difference is that today the student
is no longer the exception, but the
rule."
When the youth population becomes
as big as the adult population, young¬
sters are no longer just potential
adults, and if grownups are not careful,
they will quickly find themselves out¬
dated and on the sidelines. It is even
possible that, in the not-too-distant
future, society will be faced with the
problem of maladjusted adults, not
maladjusted youth.
Professor Sivadon points out that a
new and fundamental mutation Is
occurring in the human species.
Neotony is a scientific term applied
to the reproductive capacity of an
Immature anthropoid in prehistoric
times. It is now used to describe the
attainment of sexual maturity In a
child.
It is now recognized that young
people today develop more rapidly
both physically and sexually, while
their emotional, moral and intellectual
development is slower and more
prolonged. The day may soon come
when most of society will be made up
of individuals possessing adult bodies
with children's heads. The youth of
today is a neotonic product already
destined for the new world of tomorrow
which will be his and which the adult
cannot understand.
The picture of such a world society
is aggravated by the fact that this
young man requires the social matrix
of the family environment, no longer
just to the age of five or six years,
but up to 15 or 20. This means that
the rôle of parents has become greater
and assumed new dimensions.
Formerly, the personality of young
people often developed by identif¬
ication with their father and mother.
It develops today by identification
with friends and comrades of the same
age group and with teenage idols,
since their former source of security
has vanished with the repeated
abdication of their parents.
According to Sivadon, "parent-
companions" have lost their signifi¬
cance and young people say, "We
might as well stick with our real friends
who are our own age."
We must therefore resume our rôle
as parents if only by acting as a lever
to test the resistance of the young,
give them impetus and help them
develop their personality and a
character of their own. This is all the
more necessary today since the grown
up youngster not only leaves his
parents but enters a new world closed
to them.
The biological changes in youth are
accompanied, as already indicated, by
changes in their social function.
Zygmunt Bauman of Poland even goes
so far as to call it "the missing social
function of adolescents" (1). He
states that the moment when young
people assume their responsibilities
and functions is postponed to much
later in life so that the time when they
share in what he calls "social profits"
(their rights) without putting their
shoulder to the wheel of "social pro¬
duction" (their duties) is becoming
longer and longer.
Having dispensed with any meaning¬
ful "rites de passage", modern society,
turns adolescents loose in what
American youth specialist August
Hollingshead calls "an ill-defined no-
man's land" to grope their way to
maturity. Without any real help from
adults, they must launch themselves
from the family "nest", become hetero¬
sexual, decide on a vocation and
create a home of their own. They still
depend on their parents for help and
financial support, and make no real
progress towards becoming adults.
They remain social and cultural
children.
Hollingshead, in his major work
Elmstown's Youth (Wiley, New York,
1945), supports Professor Bauman
when he writes, "The adolescent's
ambiguous position in the society may
be a product of the loss of function
for this age group in our culture."
(15 "Some Problems in Contemporary Edu¬
cation", The International Review of Social
Sciences, XIX, no. 3, 1967, Unesco

c AUGHT between contra¬
dictory cultural, educational and social
factors, especially the gap that separ¬
ates the realities of life from the
idealism in the classroom, it is no
wonder the young become neurotic
and frustrated. Their reactions ag¬
gressiveness, complete apathy and the
"tune In, turn on and drop out"
approach to unreality catch both
parents and teachers off guard.
Professor Bauman finds that Polish
students react by becoming militant
idealists, socially committed, In marked
contrast to the ego-centric defensive
attitudes of young workers who prefer
to seclude themselves in a small
private world of their own consisting
of matters and things which are
certain and which they themselves
can control.
Sivadon, Baumann, and Hollingshead
each use a different approach to arrive
at a common conclusion: that the
different situations which young people
must cope with force them to play a
variety of rôles and adopt different
attitudes and opinions.
These rôles often contradict them¬
selves, giving rise to deeper conflicts
and doubt, which in turn lead young
people to question every established
value: to them, all rules and restric¬
tions become relative. The result is a
permanent threat of the disintegration
of culture and society: the result is
dissent and rejection, fear and anxiety.
If to this we add the fact that the
number of years spent in university
is increasing, that many of the brighter
students are taking several degrees,
doing research in various fields at the
same time before joining the outside
world, there is Indeed real cause for
concern. In every big university one
can find dozens of brilliant students
between the ages of 25 and 30 who,
while not refusing to leave their youth
behind, refuse to take the plunge into
adult life.
Let us not forget that European
society has undergone a profound
change since the 1950s and especially
the 1960s. Before then, Man was
classified according to whether his
activity was productive or aesthetic.
Despite opposition from self-styled
radicals, there was a consensus'
attributing a moral value to work,
trades and other activities in addition
to their great practical importance.

The technological society Is rapidly modifying our whole environment and the
pre-eminence of the machine has led many young people to ask whether we are evolving
a new subterranean labyrinth to trap the individual into becoming a mere tool of the
automated, computerized society.

THE ANGRY GENERATION (Continued)
For many, their profession or trade
was a means of self-development;
others saw in manual labour the
origin of human dignity. This dignity
formed the basis of the workers' class
consciousness and their goal at that
time was to reorganize society,
following the principles of social
advancement and economic planning.
Admittedly these values have not
entirely disappeared but they have
become considerably weaker. A way
of thinking oriented to the consumer
and an awareness of his needs have
come to the fore. This "consumer
philosophy" is the result of a change
in man's outlook: the image projected
before his eyes is that of "man the
consumer" and no longer "man the
producer".
The industrial society. Sociologists
disagree on what to call this type of
society. Some term it the industrial
society, since it stresses the growing
predominance of industry over agri¬
culture.
This definition Is not too bad, but
we may well ask ourselves if we shall
have one industrial society or several.
Many arguments have' been advanced
forecasting the universalization of in¬
dustry; many other arguments have
been advanced predicting greater di¬
versity between countries and their
industrial patterns. We still don't know
whether the world process of indus¬
trialization will produce the same type
of society everywhere: already there
is talk of a post-industrial society.
Certainly the predominantly agricul¬
tural countries of the Third World
should not be overlooked. Exploiting
the world's potential to its maximum
could conceivably lead to the creation
of one gigantic city almost entirely in
the northern hemisphere, bordering on
a world-wide rural area in the southern
hemisphere.
The technological society. Society
has also been defined in terms of tech¬
nology. Certainly technology is play¬
ing an ever increasing rôle. We are
surrounded by technology on every
side, without always being aware of it.
This technological ideology is part of
the competition between countries
with different economic systems and
has resulted in the arms race and the
rapid outmoding of equipment.
The urban phenomenon. And yet
urbanization seems more important
than technology. It is through the city
that technology enters society, and
consequently the major technological
problems of society are in fact urban
problems. The growing importance
of technology demands a social frame¬
work, and has given rise to various
groups for whom technology is a true
ideology and who see themselves as
a class: the technocrats.
Theoreticians of leisure. Theoreti¬
cians of leisure base their ideas on
facts from which a host of arbitrary
conclusions are often derived. Cer¬
tain facts are indisputable leisure, i.e.

part of society. But a careful analysis
of time shows that we must distinguish
between working time, free time
(leisure) and routinized time (travel to
and from work, the myriad formalities
demanded by the bureaucratization of
society). Routinized time is the off¬
spring of our tentacular cities, and
results from the divorce between one's
place of work, one's home and one's
leisure activities. It is astonishing to
find that while working time decreases
leisure time does not increase: the dif¬
ference is eaten up in "routinized time."
The consumer society. Can one
speak of a consumer society? Indeed
one can, but there are nuances to
consider. It is certainly not enough
to note the claims advanced in indus¬
trial countries that past production was
not adapted to needs because of igno¬
rance of these needs on the part of
manufacturers. Actually, it was be¬
cause they didn't know their market.
Today however, production is organized
in such a way that the market is care¬
fully canvassed in advance so that not
only is the expected consumer demand
precisely anticipated but also the con¬
sumer's secret wishes and desires.
Now this is a practice that has raised
many an objection. There are of
course market surveys galore, motiva¬
tion studies and similar paraphernalia,
but it is obvious that the accent is.

to the detriment of society's needs

### 57880: The Angry generation

Student committees in many
countries are calling for a complete
revamping of the structure
of higher education. Their
criticisms of educational systems
often dating back to the
19th century are shared
by many professors.
Here teachers and students
take part in an "action committee"
discussion at the Faculty
of Medicine in Paris.
schemes, for instance, we note that
everything relating to the community's
social needs is strangely neglected.
Instead we find that needs are fabri¬
cated by those who control production,
with the aid of advertising which
moulds and stimulates the new needs
with their packaging and other gim¬
micks. We thus arrive at the logical
conclusion that those who control the
reins of production also control the
course of consumption.
As a matter of fact, there is no
direct planning of production, but only
indirect, oblique planning. All around
us now are the market study boys
feverishly preparing, predicting, pro¬
gramming the consumer market, and
so churning, dissecting and manoeuv¬
ring our daily lives for the great
hopper of production.
Henri Lefebvre has coined the fol¬
lowing definition of our contemporary
world, "a bureaucratic consumer-tail¬
ored society." Contrary to forecasts
made a dozen years ago, production
is becoming less and less related to a
sense of social awareness, or to the
activities and needs of society as a
whole. The consumer culture does
nothing to link people together; it
evolves around a solitary act.
Marcuse & the industrial society.
In his One-Dimensional Man, Professor
Herbert Marcuse makes a critical anal¬
ysis of modern industrial civilization.
He sees society dominated by techno¬
logy which he describes as a power
in itself, all the more to be feared since
it acts in and against man to make him
a mutilated, one-dimensional being.
If the purpose of the social apparatus
is "to create a humane existence on
the basis of a humanized nature," then
it defeats its purpose, Marcuse writes,
for "we live and die rationally and pro¬
ductively." It is this which mutilates
our liberties and satisfactions.
Bureaucrats, administrators, planners
and party officials are all obsessed
now by one thing: the absolute priori¬
ty they give to production. Pots are
made to put soup in and soup is made
to fill the pots, as Marcuse expresses
it. It is quantity not quality that is now
the overriding preoccupation of life and
human welfare. And what counts in
the Industrial society is to have more
rather than to be more, the standard
of living rather than the art of living.
In all systems, socialist or capitalist,
there exists, says Marcuse, the same
"collusion of modern society and
power."
Man is now only an instrument. The
administration of things has replaced
government of people, and we reach
the surrealistic limit of both rationality
and absurdity when we sell "luxury
fall-out shelters" equipped with every
modern convenience.
We must rediscover the art of living,
Marcuse asserts, and rebel against the
totalitarianism of technocratic reason¬
ing. We must rediscover flowers and
love. We must reject psycho-socio¬
logy that aims at providing treatment
for the individual so that he may con¬
tinue to function as part of a sick civili¬
zation, and which "transforms our
hysterical misery into banal unhappin-
ess," as Freud put it.
The tyranny suffered by man in our
industrial society which we call demo¬
cratic is as total, alienating and dehu¬
manizing as the worst dictatorship.
Social science students have popular¬
ized these ideas: they refuse to be
treated as things or objects, and pro¬
claim their determination not to be
integrated in a society where they
would become the massifiers and the
massifled, the manipulators and the
manipulated.
Roots of the student revolt i
I had first thought of review¬
ing the history of student revolts in
Europe country by country. But having
assembled the documentation, I realiz¬
ed the enormity and futility of such a
task, convinced as I now am that the
dissatisfaction of youth is a world-wide
phenomenon, varying only in the forms
this dissatisfaction takes in different
countries.
A comparative study of the adminis¬
tration of European universities would
be useful in interpreting present-day
events by showing the various levels
of progress and traditions reached by
different universities, in administrative,
legal and other day-to-day matters.
Thus we find that reforms now de¬
manded by students in one university
have long been achieved in another.
Students in Oslo, for instance, have for
years been managing university book¬
shops, student restaurants, hostels, the
publication of study courses, and
taking part in faculty councils. In fact,
I was recently told that the one thing
Oslo students now object to most is
the bureaucracy of student manage¬
ment!
Such a study would enable us to
look at each of the Scandinavian
countries separately instead of lumping
them together as we often do. We
would find that there has been so
much violence in Denmark that a full
scale debate was called in Parliament
on May 16, 1968.
During the debate the Minister of
Justice reported that since January
1965, 137 street demonstrations had
been organized, 85 of them held in
front of foreign embassies. In all
cases, the organizers had complied
with the regulations requiring them to
notify the authorities in advance. In
only 11 cases were the police obliged
to intervene and use force. The Mini¬
ster pointed to these figures as an
example of the moderation and good
sense on the part of demonstrators.
Most of the demonstrations at least
all those held in front of embassies
were organized by student groups.
Following the recent violent de¬
monstrations at the University of Co¬
penhagen, the Rector, Mr. Mogens
Fog, had this to say about their un¬
derlying causes:
"There is no doubt an element of
psychological 'contagion' that spreads
among emotional young minds. But I
believe that at the root of these de¬
monstrations there is a social conflict
with far deeper implications. Enmesh¬
ed in the complex web of modern so¬
ciety, the average person feels too
remote from the areas of decision mak¬
ing. This is true both of the East
and the West. At the origin of student
demonstrations one always finds some
dissatisfaction with the educational
system, and added to this is a feeling
of frustration. Street demonstrations
are one way to arouse society, but
when students have taken part in many
demonstrations without achieving any
practical result, they inevitably feel a
sense of frustration."
Universities in Great Britain have a
privileged position due to their long
established tradition of independence,
and thanks to a highly effective system
of study awards and scholarships. -_

THE ANGRY GENERATION (Continued)

who take a degree Is very much
higher.
In France, the attitude of workers
towards students is very different from
that of workers in the Federal Republic
of Germany. In France, it is quite
clear that the student explosion of
last year would not have had its elec¬
trifying detonator effect if, despite the
opposition of trade unions and political
leaders, public opinion had not
supported the students from the very
start and had the mass of non-union
and union workers not brushed aside
the views of the trade unions to join
the movement. In the Federal Repub¬
lic of Germany, on the other hand,
public opinion, and particularly the
workers, strongly disapprove student
action.
One of the most explosive situa¬
tions is found in Italy, whose student
population has expanded more rapidly
than that of any other European coun¬
try. Italy's universities, too, are more
tradition-bound and are strictly con¬
trolled by their academic pundits.
For an objective analysis, overriding
national frontiers and showing that stu¬
dent unrest, however varied its forms,
is basically a world-wide movement, it
is worth reading a new quarterly jour¬
nal, "Dialogue" (published by the U.S.
Information Service in Washington),
the first issue of which is devoted to
"Ferment in the University."
The issue carries an important arti¬
cle entitled "The New Involvement
With Society" by Clark Kerr, and an¬
other article, "The Alienated Genera¬
tion" by Mark R. Killingsworth. The
latter writes:
"As citizens many activists see a
hypocritical society which condones
the use of napalm but not marijuana;
whose public officials seem to them
insensitive or incapable before prob¬
lems ranging from the ghetto to Viet¬
nam.
"As students they see a bureaucratic
educational system whose teachers
are remote and uninterested in them;
whose administrators never listen se¬
riously to their views on issues (hous¬
ing, academic problems, regulations,
student activities) which vitally affect
them; and in whose classrooms they
are expected not to participate but
merely to listen.
"As potential employees they see
vast corporations and unions which
cynically manipulate and depersonalize
people rather than liberate them and
provide interesting and challenging
work.
"Such a society, many activists be¬
lieve, cannot possibly fulfill the hopes
and talents of the individual. Many
seek a 'participatory democracy', in
which people participate as directly
as possible in decisions which affect
them from their education to their
work to their government's policies."
Killingsworth states that many acti¬
vist students "detest the bureaucratic
multiversity," which, they feel, turns
students into "so many depersonalized
IBM cards," and he endorses the opin¬
ion of Mayor John V. Lindsay of New
York, who pointed out in 1966 that
feelings of alienation and powerless-
ness were common elements in both
the Berkeley student revolt and the
Watts Negro riots in California.
II O me the key words of
today's student unrest are autonomy,
self-government and dissent.
The demand for autonomy in Euro¬
pean universities is directed chiefly
against the state, as a bureaucratic
machine increasingly bent on centrali¬
zation. Basically, it is a claim for a
new concept of human dignity.
During the Middle Ages many uni¬
versities had already achieved autono¬
my. A large number are autonomous
today in the United States and Great
Britain. Autonomy gives the university
a freer hand as well as greater flexi¬
bility in meeting regional and local
needs, introducing new subjects and
teaching methods, and in integrating
inter-faculty teaching of certain cour¬
ses. The rigid compartmentalization of
faculties is now out of step with the
needs of modern interdisciplinary re¬
search.
But as soon as the State is called
upon to help, the use of state funds
is involved, thus raising the problem
of some form of control being applied
to the allocation and spending of
public money.
Now we come to the important ques¬
tion. Autonomy no doubt promotes a
sense of dignity and responsibility,
but it can also lead to a dispersion of
effort. Governments should ponder
carefully the advantages of allowing
Lille, Rome or Munich, for example,
to settle the problems of their univer¬
sities with only the specific needs of
these universities in mind, against the
disadvantages and risks in seeking
solutions that are partial, diversified
and sometimes even contradictory.
Such decisions are of vital impor¬
tance when universities and young
people have everything to gain from
the international recognition of their
educational standards and university
degrees.
Self-government by students is not
a new idea. Indeed, four centuries ago
students in Salamanca, Spain, shared
with their teachers the responsibilities
of university administration. The same
principle operates today in many U.S.
universities which have a dean of stu¬
dents.
Not being an economist, I cannot
judge the merits of self-government on
the basis of production figures. But
I can evaluate its educational and cul¬
tural achievements as revealed by the
important experiments in self-govern¬
ment I have followed in Yugoslav in¬
dustry.
These experiments have stimulated
everyone since each individual feels
he has a share In the undertaking
not only to feel personally responsible,
but to do everything possible to meet
his responsibilities. Permanent re¬
fresher courses and self-improvement
are now de rigueur for workers at
every level in Yugoslavia.
Student dissent is concerned both
with today's consumer society and
with the university itself. Students see
a need for many reforms in the aca¬
demic system. They are opposed to
the traditional professorial lectures
which they feel should be replaced by
a dialogue and group discussions.
They reject the present examination
system by which, at the whim of an
anonymous examiner or a chance
question selected out of a hat, thou¬
sands of young students either gradu¬
ate or have their careers ruined.
They want more streamlined courses
and less cramming, of endless facts
and figures. They know that many of
the "truths" taught them are no longer
true, that knowledge becomes out of
date and that degrees, too, lose their
value with time.
They demand a university open to
free discussion and criticism, "parallel"
lectures on the same subject by differ¬
ent professors where opposing views
can be analyzed and debated. Many
question the concept of knowledge
itself which they view as "a collection
of established facts no longer, but an
unending, ever-changing conquest that
actually thrives with dissent."
They know their lives are no longer
divided into two parts: one in which
they stuff themselves with knowledge
and technology, the other where they
apply what they have learned. They
realize that they are entering a society
where even the most brilliant specia¬
list may quickly find himself out of
date, where one can be old hat even
at the age of 30, and where nothing
is more dangerous than to be a super
specialist In one subject and nothing
else.
They have heard the remark of Rob¬
ert Oppenheimer that the scientist of
60 can no longer carry on research
without the discoveries made after he
left the university.

If the problems of students are acute, those of young industrial workers are often more poignant and
distressing problems of unemployment, problems of working hours and working conditions, problems of salary
and a host of others. The situation of the young agricultural worker in much of the world defies description.
They know that the university has
now taken on unparallelled impor¬
tance, undreamt of by older genera¬
tions, because no graduate will ever
really "graduate," but instead, is pre¬
destined for a lifetime of study, re¬
fresher courses, updating and exacting
readjustment.
E,VEN if the university were
only ten years behind the times it would
still fail in its task. For young people
of today who will be 50 in the year 2000,
the traditional university is like the
horse and buggy in the age of jet tra¬
vel. In its present unwieldy form, its
archaic approach and methods, and
the mistaken notion that four, five or
seven years are enough to charge up
a mental battery to last a whole car¬
eer, the university is sadly out of
step. One might even ask if it can
still be "doctored" up. What is really
called for is a heart transplant, or
better still, a brain transplant.
The renovation and reorganization of
the university is the concern and res¬
ponsibility of society at large, inas¬
much as those who are studying there
today and who will be tomorrow's
leaders are destined to return to it
periodically until they retire.
The university will not just double
its population by becoming more demo
cratic; enrolment will skyrocket as
all its alumni are forced to return. And
it will also quadruple its campuses,
laboratories, libraries, medical ser¬
vices, hostels and teaching staff. And
so will its budget.
There is one thing we should not
forget, for the society of tomorrow
demands it the only valid investment
is investment in people. Other invest¬
ments will have to take their turn.
The consumer society is being
challenged and young people are as
opposed to integration into a capi¬
talist or a socialist bureaucracy for the
sake of efficiency. Studies in the so¬
cialist countries show that young
people brought up to believe in the
principles of equality and justice are
shocked by official indifference or
stick-in-the-mud attitudes. They cannot
understand why the needs of planned
development must necessarily sacri¬
fice them on the altar of market re¬
quirements or why their ideals should
be dashed against the wall of bureau¬
cracy.
In Western countries too, as last
year's declaration by the bishops of
France made clear, young people are
no longer willing to be reduced to the
rôle of producers, consumers or mere
performers of orders. They demand
"not the means to live, but reasons
for living." They are up in arms
against a society in which men are not
their own masters, but prisoners of the
system. They see themselves as real
proletarians, if a proletarian is some¬
one "who has no say in the use
made of his life, and knows it" (to
quote one student slogan); they de¬
mand "social structures at the service
of man," and not "man at the service
of structures" (as another slogan
put it).
From now on th'e exercise of author¬
ity will require a dialogue. The French
author Gilbert Cesbron echoes the
views of the French bishops when he
writes that the young "have had the
time to pass judgement on the society
of false needs and false leisure that
degrade the West, and to shout two
simple words that may well save the
day for tomorrow: "Dialogue - Parti¬
cipation!"
Youth have raised their voice. They
now demand the right to be heard in
full. Circumstances led me to prepare
this study from the viewpoint of stu¬
dents. Had I dealt with young indus¬
trial workers and their problems of
unemployment, emigration and labour
market fluctuations, the picture would
heve been more sombre still. It might
well have made unbearable reading if
I had written it with Europe's young
agricultural workers in mind.
Let us give youth the task of build¬
ing the future. That is all they ask.

### 57881: Towards a new kind of involvement

TOWARDS
by Alexander Corbovsky

.XTREMIST, passive, in¬
different to everything, idealistic, eager
to serve society, sceptical, cynical.
These are only a few of the conflicting
terms used to describe the youth of
today, often backed up by the results
of public opinion polls. Little wonder
then that it is claimed that youth as a
separate entity simply do not exist.
Just how true is this last statement?
Or to put it another way, are the
horizontal ties that link young people
to their own age group stronger than
the vertical ties linking them with the
older generations?
In former society the vertical ties
were certainly stronger. The son of
an aristocrat became an aristocrat like
his father, the son of a clerk was a
clerk in embryo from the day he was
born, and there was little chance of
escaping this socîal and often self-
imposed hierarchy.
If things are different today, and
if there is a feeling of solidarity among
young people often transcending
national, religious and social barriers,
it is the result of a long process that
has gone on for generations. The
trend really began when increasing
numbers of young people sought
independence from their parents at
an earlier age, leaving home and
striking out on their own. It has
culminated with the present movement
that has gone beyond individual protest
against the family to the organized
revolts we are witnessing today.
To understand what lies behind
these revolts we must not overlook the
changes that have taken place in what
we can call "the social ideal."
Whereas in the past what counted
most for young people were the
material things in life, new values have
taken on greater importance. Thus
many young people now prefer creative
careers to those that pay more but
offer less scope for creativity.
A recent poll of almost 3,000 students
in Rostov-on-Don brought this out
clearly. Asked to indicate why they
had chosen their particular career for
study the vast majority answered:
ALEXANDER GORBOVSKY of the U.S.S.R. is
a research sociologist at the Moscow Institute
of the World Workers Movement, where he
heads a research group of scholars now
studying the psychological characteristics of
intellectuals. This study will be part of a
broad Soviet enquiry concerning the future
of intellectuals. Alexander Gorbovsky has
written widely on sociological and historical
questions.
"Because it's creative." Only 11
students replied, "Because I will earn
more money." This attitude is not
limited to students but reflects the
thinking of Soviet youth in general, as
other surveys have borne out. Similar
findings have been made in many
other countries.
Many sociologists feel that there
is now not just a gap or even a
yawning gulf between the generations
but open antagonism and hostility.
The connexion between the revolt of
young intellectuals against the rule
of material values and the much talked
of "conflict of generations" is not hard
to find: we see it wherever the older
generation clings to the ideals and
values the younger generations flatly
reject.
There is a growing conviction among
young people that money can't buy
everything and that money isn't the
only worthwhile thing in life. The
Beatles' song, "She's Leaving Home,"
makes this point in the story of the
girl who runs away from home while
her parents can't figure out why since
they "gave her everything money
could buy."
L,.OOKED at from this angle
the student unrest and the revolt
against the older generation, the
appearance of the beatniks, the
hippies, the provos and other protest
groups, would seem to be part of a
single process; the change in the
existing system of values. But while
older folks see this change as a slow,
gradual affair young people see no
reason for waiting and their impatience
is often expressed in explosive, violent
form. The whys and wherefores of this
are both "objective" and "subjective."
Let us look first at the objective
causes. All the countries hit by
student unrest in the past year have
one thing in common: first, a
concentration of jobs and power in
the hands of older folk while young
people often have neither; second,
little or no voice by youth in civic and
social affairs.
The technological revolution and the
advent of automation have given rise
to what sociologists term "factory
depopulation." A young man stepping
out into the world often finds that
there is no job for him. Although new
jobs are being created all the time
there are not enough to meet the
demands of the many who want to
start work. And even if many
employers eagerly welcome the hiring
of young people, it is youth who make
up the biggest percentage of unem¬
ployed today.
Youth also want a real voice in
political life. In many countries the
voting age is twenty-one (1). This
tradition goes back to the days of
King Arthur and Richard the Lion Heart
when knights were dubbed at the age
of twenty-one. But political maturity
has nothing to do with knighthood,
and this ancient tradition still deprives
countless young people from voting
in elections.
As for the making of laws and the
drawing up of national or local legisla¬
tion, the position of youth is even
worse. Age and a host of other
qualifications are such for would-be
members of parliament that young
people are virtually barred from
becoming members in many countries.
Since young men and women now
make up a quarter of the world's
population why shouldn't they be
better represented in legislative bodies
and allowed to decide too on their
country's affairs, not least of all in
matters relating to youth questions?
In most countries" a person must be
at least 25 years old to run for a seat
in parliament and 30-35 to qualify
for election to the Senate.
In the U.S.S.R. the minimum age for
members of local legislatures, the
legislative bodies of the different
republics and the nation (Supreme
Soviet) is respectively 18, 21 and 25.
There is now a proposal that 30 to
35 per cent of local Soviets should
be made up of deputies in the
18-30 age group since almost half the
population of the Soviet Union is under
the age of 30.
The second or subjective reasons
for youth's impatience with things as
they are have to do with some of the
psychological characteristics common
to youth generally. More than
2,000 years ago Aristotle wrote:
"All their mistakes arise from the
fact that they exaggerate everything
they do and that they do it with
passion. All they do is done to
excess: they love to excess and hate
to excess, and the same with all other
things." In the light of much that is
going on in the world these words are
(1) Exceptions are Brazil, Israel, Uruguay
and the U.S.S.R. where the voting age is 18,
and Japan and Switzerland where it is 20.

### 57881: Towards a new kind of involvement

A NEW KIND OF INVOLVEMENT
perhaps truer today than when the
great Greek philosopher expressed
them two millennia ago.
But the emotional exuberance of
youth has both a positive and negative
aspect: "black" is not just black, it is
"the blackest"; "bright" looks "radiant
bright". That is why both positive
and negative situations provoke such
strong reactions on the part of young
people.
Soviet youth are no exception here.
If they accept as their own the overall
values of the society they live in, they
vigorously reject everything they think
is wrong, obsolete and bureaucratic.
They are much more vehement than
their elders in the things they disagree
about, and the more educated they are
the more critical they become. One
survey carried out in a town in the
Sverdlovsk region revealed that
people who had had a higher education
were five times more critical than
those who had not.
This of course does not mean that
increasing the number of educated
people automatically builds up a
stronger negative element in society.
Education raises the intellectual level
of society as a whole and makes
people want higher standards and
expect more from one another.
Young intellectuals adopt a highly
critical attitude not only towards their
environment; they are also their own
severest critics. To the question
asked by Soviet sociologists, "Do you
like your generation?", the highest
proportion of negative answers came
from young intellectuals.
IHE problems and difficult¬
ies that young people come up against
are partly responsible for this attitude.
One such major problem is access to
higher education. In the U.S.S.R.
higher education is free, and almost
all students receive study grants.
Higher education has become so
popular that Soviet colleges and
universities are literally besieged each
year by many thousands of young
applicants.
Between 60 and 80 per cent of the
students graduating from secondary
schools In Soviet cities try to enrol in
a university or other institute of higher
education. In some faculties as many
as 10 to 15 applicants compete for
each vacancy. But as a rule only one
out of three candidates can be
accepted. The remaining two-thirds
must resort to other kinds of study or
try again the following year.
Surveys carried out in Novosibirsk
(only 25 miles from Akademgorodok,
the "Science City" of Siberia) show
that a good half of all the students
leaving secondary school want to be
doctors, engineers or scientists, or
wish to study for other intellectual
professions. Careers in agriculture
and the service industries are far down
on the list of popular trades and
professions.
Even when a student is lucky
enough to gain admission to one of
the universities other disappointments
may well be in store for him (or her).
An extensive survey recently made at
the university, the teacher training
college and the medical college in
Rostov-on-Don revealed that one
student in eight was unhappy with his
chosen course of study. Despite this,
most of these students do not switch
to another field and will eventually
wind up working in a profession they
have little enthusiasm for.
When graduates of the technical
institutes in Leningrad were questioned
about their future plans it was found
that four out of five of the young men
and women polled wanted to go into
research or creative design work. But
everybody, obviously, cannot become
a research worker or a creative
designer, and many of these young
people are in for a big disappointment.
The ardour for a better education
manifests itself in a variety of ways.
At. a number of Moscow industrial
complexes a major reason for the
migration of young workers is not the
pay (17 per cent of those polled) but
the lack of adequate conditions for
raising their cultural and technical
level (26 per cent). Furthermore,
75 per cent of rural youth from the
Oryol and Kurgan regions want to
leave villages for towns in order to
continue their general education.
The real problem, then, is how to
relate young people's aspirations to
the actual possibilities as well as to
the interests of society. The gap
between the two is naturally the cause
of much discontent.
But as we have noted earlier, the
exuberance of youth finds its outlet
not only in negative reactions. When
young people become enthusiastic
about an idea they go all out for it,
too. This is exactly what happened in
the case of the virgin lands in
Kazakhstan as well as in Siberia and
the far north.
A survey carried out in Leningrad
not long ago revealed an amazing
fact: one out of every five young
people in that modern, industrial
metropolis was quite prepared to
abandon "the ease and comfort of city
life at the prospect of adventure and
pioneering work in the frozen north,
the isolated tundras of Siberia and
other remote areas of the Soviet Union.
A. _ few years ago a call went
out for volunteers to help build a rail¬
way line from Abakan to Taishet in
Siberia. Of the 35,000 persons who
responded to this call, 26,000 were
young people 20 years of age or under.
Despite the horrible climate and the
harsh working conditions the volunteers
pushed the railway line through the
Sayani mountains, across taiga and
marshland, and over the turbulent
rivers and waterways that cut across
their path, transforming what had at
first seemed a wild dream into an
accomplished fact carried out with
gusto and enthusiasm. A similar res¬
ponse came when a call was issued to
help build the Bratsk power station,
also in Siberia.
Thus we see that the vitality of youth
can find expression either in an
explosion of discontent or an explosion
of enthusiasm. The answer to many
of the problems now facing a large
number of countries would seem to lie
in a dual approach: on the one hand,
to see to it that the causes making for
discontent among young people are
reduced, if not eliminated; on the other
hand, to see to it that new opportuni¬
ties are opened for young men and
women so that they can realize their
aspirations by putting their natural
enthusiasm to constructive use.
Experience has shown, not only in
the U.S.S.R. but in every corner of the
globe, that if given half a chance and
the trust and respect they ask for and
deserve young people everywhere
come through with flying colours.
They have amply shown that they can
think for themselves, act courageously,
efficiently and with vigour. What they
need is to be given the chance. Is it
not true that everywhere where the
chance has been opened up to them
they have taken the lead in new
branches of science, engineering,
production and industry? What are
we waiting for?

### 57882: Three-dimensional youth: developing countries, socialist countries, Western countries

THREE-DIMENSIONAL YOUTH
developing countries
socialist countries
western countries
by Ehsan Naraghi
IHE crisis of youth that has
swept the world has affected countries
with different political systems, the
highly industrialized countries as well
as the developing nations of the
so-called Third World.
Depending on the ideologies and
conceptions of their leaders, this
problem is approached differently and
given more or less importance.
In certain countries, youth's unrest
is a passing phenomenon that threat¬
ens neither the structure of society
nor its basic institutions. In others,
it is expressed through violence,
challenges the whole Establishment
and its institutions or at least certain
practices and fundamental principles
that govern the upbringing and edu¬
cation of the young.
Youth's radical demands, their
anxiety about the future and the fact
that they are not yet integrated into
the social pattern have focussed
attention, consciously or unconscious¬
ly, on the social and cultural problems
and contradictions of our time.
Youth's critical attitude may appear
abstract, violent, irrational, immature,
or even negative and lacking in per¬
spective, but it forces adults to revise
their habits and ways which they
would otherwise not have questioned.

EHSAN NARAGHI is professor of sociology
and director of social studies and research at
the University of Teheran (Iran). A member
of the Executive Committee of the Interna¬
tional Association of Sociology, he has written
widely on sociological problems in the deve¬
loping countries. In 1966 he prepared a spe¬
cial report for the U.N. Special Fund on the
training and employment of scientific and
technical personnel in Latin America, Africa
and Asia. He was a member of the interna¬
tional group of specialists sponsored by
Unesco, which met in Bucharest last year to
prepare a project for the promotion among
youth of ideals of peace, mutual respect and
international understanding.
"Senile delinquency." For years,
the industrially advanced countries
have talked of the adaption of youth
to society. Sociologists and psycho¬
logists have dealt with the problem
of maladjusted adolescence and
"juvenile delinquency." We appear
to be witnessing today a revolt of
young people who refuse to adapt to
our society, who call their parents'
attitude "senile delinquency," who
condemn adult society and believe
that they possess new values.
I recall the violent though somewhat
localized reactions of youth during the
1950s in the U.S.A. and Europe,
particularly in Sweden. This violence,
portrayed in the James Dean film,
"Rebel Without a Cause," reflected
the attitude of many young people at
the time. It showed teenagers of a
technological society where boredom,
monotony and indifference engendered
aggressiveness expressed through
physical violence.
Since then, there has been an
Right, young farmers

In the developing
countries, ancient
methods of work
often seem
absurd to a
generation stimulated
by the information
media to have
ambitions and
aspirations unknown
to their fathers.
They demand more
education and
professional training,
and a meaningful
role in society
after graduation.

important change. Violence Is no
longer just physical. It also derives
from other factors: wars, social
injustices, racial discrimination, ar¬
chaic institutions.
In fact, youth's horror of any kind
of armed conflict or war Is now a
fairly general phenomenon. The
world's youth find it difficult to accept
that after World War II and after the
nations set up a world organization
to keep the peace, that wars and
killing should still be possible. Do
not all countries constantly proclaim
their desire for peace?
For though it is true that the United
Nations has rendered invaluable ser¬
vice to the cause of peace and inter¬
national understanding, the uncom¬
promising attitude of youth cannot
condone the use of force by any
nation. That is why youth feels a
certain scepticism about the pacifist
declarations of international organiza¬
tions and States; the scepticism can
even go 'so far as the use of the
word hypocrisy.
As regards war, we seem to be
moving toward the crumbling of ideo¬
logical and nationalistic concepts

which in their present form are losing
their raison d'être in the eyes of
youth.
Scientific and technological advan¬
ces, the conquest of space and the
closer ties between nations through
improved communications are shrink¬
ing the world. Despite the persistence
of national particularisms, a feeling of
fraternity of all mankind is growing
among young people. That is why
many - young people condemn the
attitude of the older generation and
refuse to accept their so-called justi¬
fications of "local" conflicts.
The "aesthetic dimension." In our
industrial societies, where everything
is subordinated to the demands of
technology, youth finds no outlet for
its vitality or enthusiasm. It is in this
context that the American economist
John Kenneth Galbraith has spoken
of the "aesthetic dimension."
The genius of the industrial system
lies in the organized use of capital
and technology, but neglects the aes¬
thetic dimension which could enrich
man's other activities by eliminating
many types of extremism.
Aesthetics, we know, is the science
of the beautiful and the feeling it
creates in man. Galbraith sees it as
everything that transcends the mech¬
anized life, everything like surprise
and fantasy in the philosophic sense
that is missing in our society, where
the unexpected and the unusual are
syphoned off for the needs of the
consumer technology.
Every aspect of life is now domin¬
ated by technology which is stamping
everyone in the same mould.
We are now witnessing the reaction
to this. That of the hippies is one
example, with their exaltation of flow¬
ers, nature and love, urging freedom
in human relations and disinterested
action, community life, non-violence
in every aspect of daily life. They
oppose all acts symbolizing submis¬
sion to the dominating rules of society:
work, a career, standardized clothing,
etc. Obviously the hippie cult is
unthinkable except in an affluent
society.
A poll taken only a few months
ago by the French Institute of Public
Opinion shows that there has been a
marked change in the attitudes of
young people as a result of material

well-being. Ten years ago, only 22
per cent of French youngsters replied
that they had everything they wanted
from the material point of view, but
today, as many as 32 per cent give
this answer.
If in France, which Is not a 100 per
cent affluent society, youth express
such satisfaction about their material
well-being, then one can well imagine
what this "satisfaction" must be in
more technically advanced societies.
The barrier of misunderstanding
between this younger generation which
have always had everything and the
older generations which have reached
the same level only after much
hardship poses a host of problems.
Formerly, tastes, recreation and even
the idea of happiness were linked to
a notion of effort that no longer
prevails. Furthermore, this material
well-being exists in an era when
young people are Integrated into
economic and social life when they
are much older.
The growth of the means of mass
communication has also speeded up
the intellectual growth of young peo¬
ple, providing them with news of world
events at an early age. This has led
them to express their views earlier
too.
All children who, by the age of 8
or 10, have watched the live TV pro¬
grammes of the space Odyssey of
Apollo 8 are deeply affected and
keenly interested by this epic flight,
which gives them new insight into the
world at large. Thus, at an early age,
they ask a host of other questions
and now feel that they are personally
"Involved" in events and problems
formerly reserved for adults, but are
denied participation in economic, poli¬
tical and social life until they are "a
little older."
Students in th? socialist countries.
The young look upon the attainments
of socialism as basically sound but
want to go further and take advantage
of their cultural heritage and new
currents of thought to engage their
elders in a new dialogue. This explains
why the desire for renewal and
freedom comes chiefly from within the
university.
Criticism has often been given
impulse by the more privileged circles
of young people. Once they have
attained material well-being and
access to higher education, these
well-feathered youngsters known in
Poland as the "banana kids", that Is,
the sons of intellectuals and State
officials go beyond this stage and
start asking embarrassing questions
about the cultural establishment.
Obviously, the present young gener¬
ation, which never knew the hardships
of the last war or the painful efforts
of their fathers in rebuilding their
devastated country, find the State
machine extremely bureaucratic. Thus
one of their slogans is the reduction
of bureaucracy to facilitate the com¬
munication and circulation of ideas.
This attitude is not found in all
socialist countries to the same degree.
In Yugoslavia, President Tito sided
with the students in their clash with
the top echelon official bureaucrats.
A Belgrade student song of the
summer of 1968 reflects this state of
mind:
"... So that all the shadows vanish
And this story may begin
The days pass . . .
Nary a nook or cranny
Without its bureaucrats
The days pass . . .
The 'Student' mag was banned
And then they regretted it
The days pass . . .
Out with indifference,
Shake the stick-in-the-muds,
The days pass ...
They're all on our side
Again, Fear not the new dawn
The days pass . . ."

Adolescents in the developing coun¬
tries. The situation of young people
in the developing countries resembles
that of European and American youth
in certain ways but also reveals a
number of differences.
The democratization of primary
education and in the more developed
countries of Latin America and the
Middle East of secondary education
has produced many certificate holders.
But often their technical knowledge is
inadequate to guarantee them a parti¬
cular job and hence any certainty of
a real future.
Here we see the consequences of
educational systems, that are copied
all too often from Western models
but correspond neither in spirit nor
form to local social and economic
conditions nor to the needs and
realities of the developing countries.
Enquiries made among these young¬
sters of 18 and 19 who have
completed secondary school confirm
their anxiety about their future
careers.
Everywhere there are complaints
of the lack of technical and pro¬
fessional training. The lycées based
on the Latin model and the secondary
schools based on English and Amer¬
ican models aimed at preparing
young people for higher education.
But the phenomenal rise in secondary
school enrolment makes it well nigh
impossible for all who graduate to
continue with higher education.
Pre-university training which does
not, as in most cases, lead to the
university creates problems of adapta¬
tion since final selection for university
takes place at the end of secondary
education rather than at an earlier
stage in secondary school which would
give students clearer guidance regard¬
ing their future.
In India, for example, where there
is a disproportionate influx of young
people into universities, the number
of graduates far exceeds the jobs
available. According to the Report of
the Education Commission (1964-66),
India has something like one million
"educated unemployed."
The difficulties facing young people
are mainly inherent In the educational
system since the democratization of
education and the population explo¬
sion have not gone hand in hand with
the appropriate training of the teaching
staff.
Because teaching is a top priority
in the developing countries and be¬
cause secondary and higher education
graduates are limited in their choice
of profession, many decide to become
teachers. Having neither training as
teachers nor any professional vocation,
they regard it as the lesser of two
evils, a make-shift profusion until
something better turns up.
This has made for a sharp deter¬
ioration in teaching standards, highly
detrimental to the intellectual develop¬
ment of the young, with the result that
the school is losing prestige in the
eyes of youth. This is happening in
the very societies where parents are
not in a position to take over the
education of their children.
Thus the chief complaints of
youngsters in the developing countries
are: lack of qualified teachers, lack
of equipment, and above all the enor¬
mous differences in the quality of
schools. As wealthier classes tend
to send their children to better staffed
and equipped schools, this leads to
injustices regarding the availability of
good schools for all children and a
gap in standards between private and
state schools, provincial and city
schools.
Thus a child in the developing
countries is aware even at a very
early age of a form of educational
injustice that goes counter to the prin¬
ciples proclaimed by the State. The
school, with Its ill-adapted, inadequate
teaching system, thus adds a new
element of disorientation and a cause
of cultural and moral frustration.
In addition, the modern mass media
have given youth aspirations and
ambitions unknown to their parents;
but present day education fails to give
young people the training they need
to achieve these ambitions, and the
outcome is rancour or aggressiveness
toward society which is bound to
increase as the years pass.
The authoritarian attitude of parents
in the developing countries is consi¬
dered by youth as a serious obstacle
to the development of their own per¬
sonalities. It is particularly apropos in
those countries where the emanci¬
pation of girls Is beginning to take
place. With no prospects of immediate
employment young people are depen¬
dent on their parents for many years,
and this is often irksome especially
when there are serious differences
concerning intellectual and moral
questions.
Rules regarding behaviour are often
quite distinct between the sexes.
The rules governing behaviour are
usually much stricter for girls than
boys unlike the freedom for both
sexes in western countries which they

### 57882: Three-dimensional youth: developing countries, socialist countries, Western countries

THREE-DIMENSIONAL YOUTH (Continued)
The emergence of a new concept of values
34
see portrayed by the cinema, TV and
other media. This has given rise to
conflicts leading either to passive
resignation, pessimism or defiance of
the traditional rules of conduct.
To the drifting youth of the dev¬
eloping countries, entry into a univer¬
sity means a new perspective, a new
confidence and the promise of a
different tomorrow which is the envy
of all non-college youngsters. The
undergraduate boy and girl have
greater freedom in their friends and
associations and their social life and
leisure. They form a community that
enjoys a special prestige with the
authorities and society.
At first sight this community might
appear to be a privileged group with
close ties with the powers that be
(and the advantages inherent therein)
but in actual fact it is more inclined
to dissent than any other sector of
the youth population.
The realization of a student's long-
held dream of entering a university
emboldens him to raise his voice
about society in a way that he never
would have dared before. He is
impatient for his country to reach the
level of development of the indus¬
trialized nations and to attain social
justice which he now feels to be vital
to his family and school environment.
He therefore by no means rejects
the affluent and consumer society as
do many European and American
students. Instead, this is what he
yearns for along with greater equality
and justice.
By the same token he pleads for a
more dynamic educational system
offering a richer, less academic and
more flexible curriculum.
Student participation in political life
is nothing new in the developing
countries. Since 1945, the students
of Africa, and especially of Asia and
the Middle East where the university
has a long history, have formed the
most dynamic movements in the
struggle for independence.
In India, after 20 years of indepen¬
dence, and despite students' complete
freedom to express their grievances
and opposition on political and other
matters, an entirely new type of protest
movement has been born in univer¬
sities In the past two years. In the
summer of 1968, the most famous and
best equipped university of India, in
New Delhi, was the scene of violent
student demonstrations calling for the
complete revamping of the spirit and
structure of higher education.
Latin American bastions of libe¬
ration. The students of Latin America
have been a powerful force in society,
fully conscious of their important role,
ever since 1918 when the Charter of
Cordoba was promulgated in Argen¬
tina, establishing the principle of uni¬
versity autonomy.
The universities, along with their
teachers and students, have been the
bastions of liberal ideas and ratio¬
nalism opposed to official clericalism.
The university reforms proposed by
the students always comprised broad
general elements aiming at the reform
of society too.
During the past few years university
enrolment has risen so sharply in Latin
America that Argentina, for example,
now boasts almost the same percen¬
tage (10 per cent) of young people
between 18 and 24 as the highly
industrialized countries.
But career opportunities for univer¬
sity graduates remain a major preoc¬
cupation of students, and many Argen¬
tine scientists and specialists, for
instance, have abandoned their own
country to seek employment abroad.
Throughout Latin America, free
tuition on the one hand, the shortage
of vocational training schools and lack
of career opportunities on the other,
leave youth only one hope the uni¬
versity. But the universities are over¬
crowded, inadequately adapted to
economic and social realities and
suffer from outmoded teaching
methods. The students are not blind
to this and their concern about the
quality of instruction and their own
future is compounded with their exasp¬
eration towards society.
Thus in Latin America, where the
university's prestige is enormous both
socially and culturally, where it has
acquired a student body of tremendous
size, the temper is toward a renewal
of all institutions and a new mode of
political and social life.
The African dilemma. The problem
is quite different in Africa where most
of the countries have recently become
independent. Most of Africa's leaders
(especially in Negro Africa) are young
and were educated in European uni¬
versities 10 to 15 years ago.
Here the conflict of generations is
apparently not as acute. However, the
career problem that worries university
graduates in Latin America, India and
Egypt is just beginning to affect young
African graduates. What is needed
now above all is a system of national
education that can operate outside the
framework of foreign aid which at
present is so extensive. There is also
the complicated and paramount prob¬
lem of the many languages of Africa
that remains to be resolved.
Conclusion. In dealing with cultural
problems, including the problem of
youth, the rich, developed countries
have perhaps been too inclined to rely
on technology to the neglect of social
tensions and the new cultural needs
created by this technology. For as a
result of technical progress the young
in the developing countries now have
leisure, time to think, time to become
informed, time to give free reign to
their imagination and their critical
faculties.
In the developing countries, the
population explosion and with it the
ascendency of youth have brought
about a complete rejuvenation of
society and an upheaval in its struc¬
tural patterns and habits.
First and foremost, it is the edu¬
cational system at all levels that is
under fire. Because of its narrow
academic formalism and its dogmatic
approach to culture, the teaching of
today no longer corresponds to the
needs of the modern world.
The most significant factor that is
revealed by a careful study of the
present crisis of youth viewed as a
whole is the emergence of a totally
new concept of values. Behind this
ferment lies a feeling of fellowship
uniting all of the world's youth,
transcending all political, economic
and social barriers or differences.
This is the reason the present crisis
is no longer a problem for educators
alone. The psychologist, the socio¬
logist and the philosopher are equally
involved. For its complexity and
compass englobe the whole of society
and indeed all civilization.
