In the Neolithic Age
(from the 5th to the
3rd millenium B.C.) an
extraordinary art of
stone polishing existed
in the Sahara region of
what is today Algeria.
Here we show one of
six anthropomorphic
statuettes discovered at
the beginning of the
20th century in the
eastern Sahara. Shaped
like a sugar-loaf with a
rounded base, these
statuettes are between
25 and 40 cms. high. The
mouth was never marked
on the delicately traced
face. Today the largest
desert in the world, the
Sahara was heavily
populated in prehistoric
times and contains relics
of a very ancient civi¬
lization.

### 188410: Gypsies: a minority at the crossroads; education opens new horizons for children of nomad families

m
it*
THE Romany people, or as they are
sometimes known, Gypsies, are
a nomadic race which originated
in India. Leaving the Indian sub¬
continent around 1000 A.D. they migrat¬
ed westwards and are found today all
over the world. It is estimated that
they now number around eight million.
During their history they have suffered
much persecution as a minority group.
In the 20th century many of them have
settled down, but considerable num¬
bers still travel like true nomads. On
account of their nomadism and
minority status, few have been able to
benefit from educational opportunities.
In recent years, however, much has
been done to try to bring education and
other social benefits to the Gypsies.
"Wanderers over all the earth" is
how a young poet, E. Irving, started his
poem about the Romany people, and it
is certainly true today that Gypsies are
to be found in many areas of the
world. Wherever they have been in
their long history, they have not failed
to interest all manner of people from
kings to peasants an interest stemm¬
ing from both fear and enchantment.
But whatever has been the social
or political response to these wander¬
ing people, there has always been a

curiosity to know more about their
customs and origins. Enquirers were
to be denied authentic information
concerning these matters until the
18th century when extensive and
scholarly research was carried out by
the first Gypsiologists. Their investi¬
gations indicated clearly that Gypsies
originated in north-western India and
started their long migrations during
the period 950-1000 A.D.
Prior to the eventual enlightenment
provided for us by early scholars,
societies visited by the Gypsies
believed all manner of stories regarding
their mysterious origins. . The Gypsies
themselves were not above supplying
interesting and bizarre reasons for
their presence. Their dark hair and
swarthy skins, their novel and colourful
dress together with their noble titles,
gave immediate credibility to their
claims of authentic cultural and terri¬
torial origins.
The Gypsies initially said that they
had come as Christian exiles from
a country known as Little Egypt.
Documents were often produced which
bore witness to a penance granted by
the Pope which allowed them to wander
for seven years. With such credentials
it was not surprising that they were
readily accepted by the communities
they visited in the course of their
migrations.
It can be appreciated that at a time
in history when nomadism was not
a characteristic of European peoples,
and when transport and communi¬
cations were comparatively primitive,
the arrival of small nomadic and non-
warring groups would probably have
been a welcome occurrence generating
great curiosity and excitement. Be¬
cause of their explicit statements of
origin, they came to be called
"Egyptians", and "Gypsy" is but a
shortened version of this term.
Found now in almost every continent
their numbers collectively must be very
large. There are no accurate statistics
but estimates seem to suggest that
outside of India and south-east Asia,
there are between seven and eight
million. Approximately half of this
number lives in Europe and of these
two-thirds are to be found in eastern
Europe. The Gypsies are present in
considerable numbers in north Africa;
Egypt, Algeria, and the Sudan. They
are found in America, from Pictou in
Canada to Rio de Janeiro in Brazil;
and also in New Zealand and Australia.
It is suggested that small groups exist
in China, the Philippines, West Indies
and Hawaii.
Numerous books have been written
about the Gypsies but many contain
gross misrepresentations of their
culture. However, there are certain
common characteristics which do
identify Gypsies throughout the world.
Nomadism has been and still is a very
important part of their lives, and
although many are now settled in
houses the desire to travel is often too
strong to resist and wandering habits
are resumed. It is, of course, this
particular characteristic which has
resulted in their global dispersal.
Language is perhaps the strongest
cultural factor which links Gypsies to
a common heritage. . The Romany
language is one of the Indo-Aryan
languages and is the strongest indi¬
cation that the Gypsies originally came
from India. Gypsies from different
lands can communicate with each other
by the use of this common tongue.
It is interesting to note that over the
centuries, although Gypsies have
always adapted their occupations to
suit changing economic conditions,
there has always been a number of tra¬
ditional and ubiquitous occupations.
Music making and dancing have always
been their custom as well as forms
of travelling entertainment such as fairs
and circuses. Other occupations in¬
clude horse dealing, a number of
handicrafts, and the women in par¬
ticular indulge in fortune-telling.
Gypsies have a strong sense of self-
identity, as a people with a distinctive
cultural heritage.
In recent years, with the improvement
of educational opportunities for people
in many countries, and with the in¬
creasing importance of literacy as an
essential means of communication in
the modern world, the Gypsies have
found that their illiterate status .has
often proved a disadvantage. Although
they may , have managed for many
decades by the use of scribes within
their community, there is certainly now
a widespread desire for their children
to go to school to acquire the skills
of reading and writing.
It is perhaps useful to isolate one
or two examples of their need for
education. In many countries a large >.

settled down and taken to house
dwelling. In some countries this has
been a forced settlement and not
always successful. Change from a
nomadic life inevitably involves them
In the life and community of the settled
society. For reasons of employment,
safety, and information about that
society, literacy is paramount. Without
it one is a social invalid, handicapped
in the thousands of details of daily life.
Education should provide both settl¬
ed and nomadic Romanies with the
tools necessary for reading and un¬
derstanding the fundamentals of their
legal rights, and of traffic regulations
associated with driving a vehicle. It
is hoped that education will allow
them the opportunity to study and
know more of their history and lan¬
guage. Their right to education is
secured both by national legislation
and international declarations on Hu¬
man Rights. It is surprising, therefore,
that so few seem to have been able
to participate in normal educational
provision.
Traditionally, nomadism has been
the main reason why Gypsies have not
taken full advantaqe of educational
opportunities. Boarding school edu¬
cation is one way to overcome the
problems of nomadism, but experience
shows that families strongly resist
such moves for they do not like being
separated. Nor can teaching by
correspondence be considered a
practical proposition when the adults
are illiterate and unable to guide the
child's learning.
But it would be a mistake to think
that any one factor alone has been
responsible for Gypsy children not
going to school. In most cases there
is a web of inter-related factors, many
of which are common to minority
groups. In a society where most of
the population is settled, it is clear
that the educational system will match
that living pattern and thus a nomadic
minority will, by way of their own life
style, be at a disadvantage. Irregular
attendance at many different schools
is not conducive to successful learning.
Many ethnic minorities with modes
of life which differ from those of the
majority often find themselves excluded
from social benefits such as schooling.
This social disadvantage is often
aggravated by discrimination and pre¬
judice which really stems from a lack
of understanding of groups about each
other. In practice this has resulted
in some schools being reluctant to
enrol Gypsy children. In a wider
historical context, Gypsies have suf¬
fered greatly from prejudice and
persecution and this, in turn, has
often hardened their attitudes against
accepting social benefits such as
schoolinq which the wider society
might offer.
A further effect of misunderstandings
between peoples is that fear usurps
curiosity and makes both groups feel
threatened by each other, and so the
normally rewarding exchanges of life
between one culture and another are
daunted by fears and suspicions that
the way of life of the minority will
succumb to the cultural prescriptions
of the stronger group. For this reason,
Romany parents have avoided sending
their children to school.
Parents' reluctance has sometimes
reflected their pride; they have made
a success of life without literacy, "so
why do our children need it?" When
children have gone to school, their
attendance has been spasmodic and
their progress correspondingly limited.
Coming from an illiterate background,
as so many do, these children find
school bewildering and difficult.
Occasionally parents think that schools
can "hand out" reading and writing
to their children and find it difficult to
understand why it is such a long and
hard job to acquire the basic skills.
Children need constant help and
encouragement if their own efforts are
to succeed.
Attempts to force Romany children
into school, which has been the
practice in many countries, have too
often resulted in the experience
proving traumatic for both schools and
children. The school environment is
so unfamiliar and in a tragic number
of cases Gypsies have suffered hostility
from other children. Most classroom
situations have little to offer the
Romany child which would allow him
to feel at home; teachers do not
always understand or feel empathy
with his way of life; and reading
materials are more related to the in¬
terests and backgrounds of the house-
dwelling pupils. Unhappy experiences
of this nature act as a further disin¬
centive for nomadic children.
In other countries, such as France,
efforts have been made to secure
regular school attendance by linking
financial benefits, such as family
allowances, to the child's attendance.
Although this may obtain the desired

results it may be at the expense of
the child's happiness because of the
family's pecuniary needs and interests.
Similar financial inducements have
been the basis of some schemes for
adult literacy, as in Sweden. Another
factor militating against education is
that many nomadic Gypsies live on
temporary, illegal encampments with
the inevitable lack of basic amenities
such as water and sanitation. With
the insecurity of these locations and
their lack of facilities, it is hardly
surprising that going to school is often
seen as of little importance.
The nomadic family generally works
together as an economic unit, and it
is perhaps for this reason that Gypsies
often consider education a weakening
element in their culture. Older children
may find school attendance conflicts
with their economic roles within the
family. Gypsies feel that their nomadic
life demands physical robustness and
often see prolonged schooling as
In many countries the authorities are taking
steps to see that Gypsies enjoy full rights
as citizens, providing for schools and
decent housing. Special classes for nomads
have been set up in many parts of the world where
there areJarge Gypsy communities.
Gypsy children often cannot attend school
regularly, and to help them new teaching
methods and specially adapted reading books
are being used. Scene in a Gypsy
camp in Greece, left, and guitar-playing
by the camp-fire in Spain, right, illustrate
two Romany characteristics love
of children and love of music.
preventing their children from adapting
to a hard and vigorous way of life.
There seems no good reason why
educational systems and schools in
particular should not be able to adapt
sufficiently to accommodate a minority
group like Gypsies. What it does
require is a sensitive and flexible
approach by all concerned. It is often
the case that when Gypsy children are
presented to a school they have had
little previous education and will be
backward compared with their peers.
If their numbers are small, a school
should be able to make available the
necessary resources so that intensive
individual attention can be given in
order for them to catch up with the
rest of the class. With large numbers
of children, however, the burden may
be too great for the existing school
both in terms of staff and buildings.
In this situation, extra accommodation
and teachers are needed for the
establishment of a bridging or induction
unit. This can either be provided at
the local school or in the initial stages
at the Gypsy encampment itself. The
latter policy certainly allows the settled
community to demonstrate their genu¬
ine concern for the children.
Educational experiences in an in¬
formal and friendly atmosphere will
go a long way to increasing the
confidence of the children in their
eventual integration into ordinary
schools. In some situations where
whole residential areas are occupied
by Romany people, as in some parts
of France, then an all-Romany com¬
munity school is perhaps the answer,
as opposed to bussing children to
different areas of a city.
But whatever policy responses are
made by the community to the needs
of minorities, it is essential that care
is taken in making provision in terms
of what the recipients want education¬
ally for their children. Parents should
be involved at all levels of decision
making and, if possible, also in the
teaching. In this way, it is ensured
that they are taking part in shaping
their own destiny in harmony and
co-operation with the rest of society.
In communities where schools are
composed of many different social and
racial groups, it is important that the

syllabus, and if possible the teaching
staff, should reflect this diversity of
cultural background. In these multi¬
racial institutions, it is also important
that teaching materials are related to
the interests of the pupils, and that
a balanced emphasis is given to the
culture, both historic and contempor¬
ary, of each group represented.
This adds to the positive enrichment
of school life and, fosters under¬
standing and friendship among its
members. The necessity in these
situations for in-service training for the
staff is obvious. Books and school
materials toqether with teaching tech¬
niques have to be developed in relation
to differing needs and interests. The
Romany culture is rich in tradition and
this can make a positive contribution
to the life and work of any school.
One difficulty associated with multi¬
racial education is that the interest of
a minority may conflict with the in¬
terests of the wider community. For
example many twelve- and thirteen-
year-old Gypsy children are expected
to take an increasing responsibility in .

> family. This may, in some countries,
clash with the minimum school leav¬
ing age of sixteen or seventeen.
A sensitive approach is needed for
it could be argued that children
learning their adult roles is an im¬
portant education in itself, and to
deprive them of this opportunity by
keeping them at school might be
counterproductive to their success in
adult life. This applies not only to
minorities but also to other social
groups in a society. At the same time,
however, advanced academic achieve¬
ment, if required, should not be denied
to those who seek it.
Keeping all these considerations in
mind, I conclude by giving a few
examples of educational schemes
which are currently being run for
Gypsy children in different parts of
the world. In France, more and more
sites are being provided and the
Gypsies are being encouraged to
stay for longer periods so that they
can take advantage of the social-edu
cational centres adjacent to the sites.
Regular attendance is also encour¬
aged, during their long winter stays,
at ordinary state schools and financial
incentives have been included in these
schemes. Government policy towards
Gypsies in France is concerned with
their social development which is
hoped to be achieved through school¬
ing, education in hygiene, "domestic
science", vocational training and the
organization of leisure activities.

Gypsies are known by many names :
Romanies, Travellers, Bohemians.
But they all belong to the same
people which originated in India and
then spread thoughout the world.
Skilled coppersmiths, horse-dealers,
tinkers and goldsmiths, their
community spirit is strongly evident
even when they settle
down and cease to speak their
language, Romany. Some Gypsies
have abandoned nomadic life
completely; others have settled
temporarily in one place between
spells of wandering. For many
Gypsies home is still likely to be a
shanty-town outside a big city or a
dilapidated shack on a piece
of waste ground (photo left).

was set up a few years ago in Madrid.
Its purpose is to make a scientific
study of the Gypsy way of life and to
find ways of improving their social
conditions. Most social work among
Gypsies in Spain is carried out
privately under the auspices of the
Spanish branch of the Catholic
philanthropic organization Caritas.
In towns with large Gypsy popu¬
lations various organizations have been
created to deal with Gypsies' needsi
in housing, schooling and work, and to
tackle the whole problem of integrating
them into the community. A magazine
entitled "Pomezia" reports on all these
activities.
In Sweden, most of the families are
now housed and the children go to
ordinary state schools, but often have
their own teacher who gives them
extra remedial help and allows them
to pursue their particular cultural
interests. . There are also extensive
programmes for adult literacy.
The Netherlands has a system of
very large régional camps which
include in their provision schools,
clinics, churches, club-rooms and
sports fields, but it is felt by many
that the camps are socially isolated
and often too far away from a town.
In the Irish Republic, some special
schools have been set up. with both
voluntary and official co-operation.
In the U.S.A., a special school for
Romany, children is .being" run in
Richmond, Virginia. It is financed by
voluntary resources and mainly con- y

centrâtes on teaching the basic skills
of reading and writing. Gypsy children
in New York are encouraged to attend
state primary schools.
In the United Kingdom, where the
government has shown its interest and
concern by helping the Advisory
Committee for the Education of
Romany and Other Travellers, there
has been a wide response to the social
and educational problems of Gypsies.
In one area where the families are
camped illegally in different parts of
a ïown, a school bus picks up a
teacher who tells the driver where the
families are. The children are taken
to a separate school where they have
intensive and individual attention with
reading, writing and mathematics and
other subjects. When they have
sufficient skills and confidence, they
enter the local primary school.
In another example, the children
have their own caravan classroom on
the playground of the primary school
where they receive extra help with
literacy and other work, and integrate
with the rest of the school for play,
games, swimming and outings. They
attend normal classés when it is
agreed by parents and teachers alike
that such promotion is desirable. In
some areas, mobile pre-school play¬
groups have been developed as well
as schemes for adult literacy. There
are, of course, many Romany children
in the United Kingdom who are happily
attending ordinary schools where great
care is taken to ensure their social and
educational progress.
In Italy, some voluntary and official
projects were set up for Gypsy
children in the early 1960s. In 1965 the
Ministry of Public Instruction decided
on the setting up of eleven classes
for children of nomads. It was called
"Opera Nomadi" (Exercise Nomad).
The schools are called "Lacio Drom"
(Pleasant journey) and in 1972 there
were sixty such schools with approxi¬
mately a thousand pupils of whom one
half attend regularly.
Providing the right education for
minority groups is a difficult task and
requires much thought and con¬
sultation. Education for minorities is
of increasing importance and success¬
ful policies should lead to a greater
understanding and mutual appreciation
among different peoples who have to
co-exist in an ever shrinking world.
It is in the schools that the foundations
for future understanding and co-oper¬
ation should be laid.

PHILAE has been dying for the
last seventy-five years. At first
the waters of the Nile crept slowly
upward, then they rose higher and
higher until, with the recent construc¬
tion of the High Dam upstream, the
island was permanently submerged.
The French author, Pierre Loti, had
mourned for Philae and her temples
in The Death of Philae when the first
Aswan Dam was built downstream at
the beginning of this century. But
the island continued to make a brief
annual reappearance when the sluices
of the Dam were opened. Philae was
finally drowned 10 years ago.
Only two alternatives remained
open: either the temples must be
abandoned to their fate, or they must
be saved. Lovers of art could not
resign themselves to seeing the
"Pearl of Egypt" disappear. They
decided that a long and costly oper¬
ation should be put in hand to save
the island of Isis the Merciful, just as
the temples of Abu Simbel higher up
the Nile had been saved. The opera¬
tion to save Philae began two years
ago and should be completed in about
three years time.
The submerged temples of Philae
have thus been brought to light again,
at the cost of enormous effort,
including the construction of the coffer¬
dam, nearly one kilometre long, which
now girdles the island. Philae was
drowned. Today, her corpse has been
brought up, almost intact, but covered
with a shroud of Nile silt, itself a

the rooms, courtyards, stairways,

When this had been completed,
technicians of the French National
Geographical Institute were able to
begin their survey (or anthropometric
record of the corpse) by means of the
marvellous process known as photo-
grammetry. Only by this means can
the temples be given back their original
appearance when they are recon¬
structed on the neighbouring islet of
Agilkia, to stand once more in all their
splendour under the harsh sun of
Aswan.
The second half of the present
century represents a vitally important
stage in our understanding of the role
of nature in our lives and of the
preservation of our environment. It
is also characterized by a new and
acute awareness of the necessity of '
saving the "historical environment" in
which we also live.
We seem to have become conscious
of the fragility not only of civilizations,
but also of the whole human race. We
seem to realize at last that every
scrap of evidence of man's history is
invaluable in interpreting the various
aspects of world culture. Thus govern¬
ments sometimes have to provide
considerable sums when it is decided
to protect some edifice which has
come to be considered as part of the
"heritage of mankind".
In this context, Unesco has alerted
world opinion and has made people
aware of what is at stake. An enter¬
prise such as the dismantling and
reassembling of Abu Simbel, a symbol
par excellence of international co¬
operation, mobilized support and stirred
public opinion in the most diverse
countries.
The salvage of the temples on the
island of Philae, between the old
Aswan Dam and the new High Dam,
is a. spectacular operation quite as '
significant as that of Abu Simbel.
Warning the world that a cultural
treasure of the greatest importance
would be lost, Pierre Loti drew
attention to the fate of the great sub¬
merged temple nearly 70 years ago,
when he entitled his account of his
travels in Egypt The Death of Philae,
from the subject of the last, dramatic
chapter of the book. These pages are
a lucid warning of the threatened
destruction of "what was once the
island of Philae, one of the wonders
of the world."
Loti knew that technological progress
was a vital necessity for the inhabitants
of the Nile Valley. He balanced this^
fact against the damage caused to*
PILLARS OF SURVIVAL. At the time of Napoleon's Egyptian Campaign in 1798
the magnificent polychrome wall paintings in the Temple of Isis were still intact, as shown
by illustration (right) from a book entitled "Description de l'Egypte" published in France,
in 1809. Then in our century, following the construction of the first Aswan Dam,
the waters of the Nile invaded Philae and the wall paintings were destroyed.
Photos above and below right show two stages of the rescue operations only a few
months ago. Above, the Temple of Isis as it was in April, its lower part still
submerged. By August of this year when photo below right was taken, the water .
had been pumped out from within the cofferdam, and workmen had begun to remove
basketfuls of the silt which enveloped the monuments in a layer two metres thick.
When the mammoth rescue operation is completed, treasures like this bas-relief
(below) of a pharaoh making a sacrifice will stand in safety on a new site.

y works of art 2,000 years old, and
realized how crucial was the choice
which must be made.
Today, we understand that there
could be no choice between the temple
of Isis and the dam. The dam must be
built in order to fertilize millions of
hectares, and at the same time, the
temple must be preserved. It is the
duty of our twentieth-century techno¬
logical civilization to discover remedies
for the destruction and pollution it
causes.
Technology becomes most accept¬
able when it rejects the idea that
economic growth must inevitably lead
to environmental pollution. Technology
should be used to preserve and
restore our cultural and artistic
treasures, as well as for promoting
economic development. It has taken
several decades for public opinion to
accept the need for this balance we
are now trying to achieve.
It will be several more years before
the splendours of Philae stand once
more under the Egyptian sun. Just
as the body of Osiris was restored
to life when Isis lovingly reassembled
the pieces torn apart and cast into
the Nile by Seth, so the temples will
be reborn, stone by stone.
The symbolism is even more striking
when we remember that the goddess
Isis, wife of Osiris, was worshipped at
, Philae. Thus will she again become
part of this eternal myth with its cycle
of death and resurrection.
This region of Philae seems pre¬
destined to divine metamorphoses and
their accompanying rites. The Abaton
the unapproachable tomb of the god
Osiris, whose cult prefigured those
religions of salvation which were to
spread over the ancient world was
venerated at Biga, close by the sacred
island. The last communities dedicated .
to the rites of Pharaonic paganism
survived on the islet of Philae. These
rites continued in the Sanctuary of
Isis the Merciful till the middle of the
6th century (one hundred and fifty
years after the Edict of Theodosius had
ordered the closing of the pagan
temples).
It was not till the year 550 that a
decree of Justinian finally destroyed
the 4,000-year-old Egyptian religion,
which had been rejuvenated by im¬
mortality rites available to all and a far-
reaching democratization of salvation.
Philae thus represented the ultimate
refuge of the old religion in a land won
over to Christianity and Gnosticism.
It was a fortress watched over by the
last priests and scribes guardians of
Egypt's ancient wisdom and the last
men capable of deciphering the hiero¬
glyphic texts. They were dispersed,
the sanctuary was looted and des
ecrated and their secret disappeared
with them. After that, the sacred texts
were to remain mute . for thirteen
hundred years, till Champollion re¬
discovered the key to them.
Philae thus seems predestined to the
great dismantling process which will
restore her to life.
At the end of the Pharaonic era, the
temple of Isis at Philae held an im¬
portant place in the Egyptian religion,
which was then undergoing a profound
transformation.
The sanctuaries date from the days
of Nectanebo (4th century B.C.)
through the Ptolemaic and Roman
periods, and the island on which they
were built lies south of the First
Cataract of the Nile. In this wild and
splendid region of Upper Egypt, the
Egyptian civilization, there was a
proliferation of monuments on this
green little island, surrounded by
sombre granite cliffs. Besides the
great, sixty-metre-long sanctuary of
Isis, with its two pylons, its colonnaded
hall, its chapels and crypts and its
vast courtyard bordered on the west
by the mammisi (or "birth house")
devoted to the annual mystery of the
birth of Horus, the sun-god, there are
a whole series of secondary buildings.
These include a chapel dedicated to
Osiris, a temple to Hathor, Trajan's
famous Kiosk, a chapel dedicated to
Imhotep, as well as the long colonnaded
path leading to the temple of Necta¬
nebo. There are quays, landing stages
on the river and obelisks, besides
several sanctuaries of which only the
outlines on the ground remain visible.
PHILAE'S STEEL CORSET. Overall view of Philae's cofferdam (above and right)
in August 1974, like some heavily laden vessel floating in the Nile. The water has been .
pumped out and the monuments are being cleaned. The next stage of the work will be a series
of special measurements and recordings known as photogrammetry, which enables
technicians to photograph objects stereoscopically and later, by use of a special machine,
to reconstitute their every feature down to the last millimetre. This will mean that
the monuments can be reconstructed exactly as before. The temples will be dissected
into some 40,000 stone blocks, weighing up to 25 tons each, in an operation similar to that
of Abu Simbel but on a much smaller scale. They will then be transported to the new site
on the nearby island of Agilkia, which rises well above the water level of the Nile.
The whole rescue operation, launched and sponsored by Unesco, will cost around $15 million.
river beats around granite reefs and
the rocks have been polished and
eroded by its waves for thousands
of years.
The valley, hemmed in by the desert,
seems to be closing in on the life-
giving Nile which flows down from the
mountains of Ethiopia five thousand
kilometres to the south. For the
Ancients, the First Cataract thus
symbolized the gate to the waters of
life and this was guarded by Isis in
her sanctuary at Philae.
Thus it was natural that, when the
first religions of salvation dawned on
the Roman world, she should be
venerated there as the goddess of
fertility, goodness, love and charity.
In this way the cult of Isis became
widespread and this extension was
reflected in the temples of Philae.
During the last five centuries of
Such is the great ensemble which,
until only a few months ago, was half
submerged all the year round, so that
its monuments, with their decoration
of bas-reliefs, were not, only hidden
from view but threatened with destruc¬
tion.
This threat has been hanging over
Philae since the first Aswan Dam was
built in 1899. The dam was raised in
1907 and again in 1929, with the result
that the temple was gradually sub¬
merged. The island became visible,
however, each August and September
when the water level dropped.
The temple of Isis thus appeared and
disappeared according to the rise and
fall of the river. These fluctuations
had already caused considerable
damage. The rich polychrome paintings,
for instance, which were still in
existence at the time of Napoleon's

expedition to Egypt in 1798, completely
disappeared, though the building
remained intact.
Since the construction up-river of
the High Dam, or Saad-el-Aali, the
water in the stretch of the Nile in
which Philae is situated, between the
old and new dams, rose so high that
the temples were immersed to half¬
way up the pylons.
Moreover, the erosion caused by
the daily rise and fall of the waters,
by as much as two to three metres,
threatened to dislocate and eat into
the sculpted blocks of granite.
The Egyptian Government which
had salvaged the Nubian monuments
south of the High Dam thanks to the
International Campaign launched by
Unesco, decided to call again on
For the temples will be dismantled
stone by stone, from their copings to
their foundations. The blocks pre¬
viously numbered and stored on dry
ground will then be removed to the
site where the Philae ensemble is to
be rebuilt on the nearby island of
Agilkia which remains above water
level all the year round.
This island had first to be prepared,
its surface levelled and its jagged
rocks razed. Thousands of tons of
granite had to be blown up and tipped
into the lake before the new foun¬
dations of the temples could be laid.
The operation will take four years
to complete and will cost about
15 million dollars. Of this sum eight
million dollars have already been
raised through contributions pledged
or received' by Unesco for the Inter-
pected. At Philae this does not seem
to have been the case, perhaps
because the foundations were explored
in 1907 when the Aswan Dam was first
raised. The gigantic undertaking at
Philae has in fact taught us little,
except about the art of building in
the Ptolemaic era.
Nevertheless, these operations,
together with the photogrammetric
surveys carried out by the French
National Geographic Institute and a
study of the texts engraved on the
stones, have drawn attention to the
quality of Egypt's Late Period monu¬
ments.

Various schemes were suggested.
One in particular proposed the building
of several dykes to isolate the island
so that the water could be lowered to
its original level. This solution
was eventually abandoned as being
too costly, particularly because the
pumping stations controlling the water
level would have had to function
constantly. Moreover, the site would
then have been in a hollow and cut off
from the surrounding landscape by the
high walls of the dykes.

Director-General, René Maheu, on

The operation involves the collab¬

archaeologists, and above all, of
workers specialized in the dismantling
and rebuilding of ancient monuments.
Luckily there is no shortage of such
skills and manpower in Egypt, where
teams have carried out similar work in

manner in which they made use of
natural lighting, the function of the

twenty-five centuries ago.
Philae is one of their masterpieces.
It deserves to be reborn.

PHILAE
an open-air museum
Philae has been justly described as "an open-air museum
of Egyptian architecture and art". The beautiful bas-relief
of the great goddess Hathor (opposite page)
stands beside the monumental gateway to
the temple of Isis. Philae was a sanctuary during
the long resistance of the ancient Egyptian
religion to Christianity, and it was in fact the early
Christians who defaced this bas-relief as a pagan idol.
Hathor is also seen below in carvings on capitals
of columns of the "birth house" of the sun-god Horus
The carvings of Philae mirror religious and historical
trends in Egypt during the rule of the Ptolemies
and the Roman Emperors. Left, protected by a falcon
are two graven "cartouches", frames containing
hieroglyphs representing the name of a Ptolemy.

### 50497: The Establishment of a new international economic order

The establishment
of a new
international economic order
In the article published below, Unesco's Director-General, René Maheu, presents his views
on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order which was the subject of a
special session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York between April 9 and
May 2, 1974.
The General Assembly met to study for the first time the problems of raw materials and
development which it considered as the most important economic questions facing the world
community today. It adopted a formal Declaration on the Establishment of a New
International Economic Order based on equity, sovereign equality, interdependence,
common interest and co-operation among all States, irrespective of their economic and
social systems. The General Assembly also adopted a Programme of Action to implement
the Declaration.
"The present international economic order is in direct conflict with current developments
in international political and economic relations," the Declaration states, adding, "Since
1970 the world economy has experienced a series of grave crises which have had severe
repercussions, especially on the developing world... (which) has become a powerful factor
that makes its influence felt in all fields of international activity."
Mr. Maheu outlines his suggestions on how Unesco can contribute to the establishment
of the new world economic order and the new paths open to the U.N. He will present his
views to Unesco's General Conference being held in Paris from October 17 to November
22,1974.
At the end of this session of the General Conference, Mr. Maheu will retire from the post
of Director-General of Unesco, which he has held since 1962. Mr. Maheu, who was
reappointed as Director-General for a second term in 1968, has decided not to stand as a
candidate for a third term, and his period of office accordingly expires on November 14.
by René Maheu
Director-General of Unesco
THE institutional system of the
United Nations is the only one,
at the present time, which prov¬
ides the political framework and the
technical facilities capable of allow¬
ing the international community to
devise, adopt and carry out action on
a world scale such as is required by
the problems of development and jus¬
tice in the economic and social sphe¬
res. There are two main reasons for
this.
The first is that the United Nations
system is the only framework in
which States, while . appreciating the
inequalities between them in respect
of power and wealth, meet on a com
pletely equal footing as regards rights
and, consequently, in which an inter¬
national order can be freely negotiated
and freely adopted, not imposed.
The second reason is that by its
very universality, the United Nations
system offers the only means
of considering the problems of the
organization of the world in their
entirety from the inside, that is, on the
basis of the immediate experience of
those concerned.
By their very nature, neither bila¬
teral relations nor specific multilateral
understandings, regional, sub-regional
or other, can offer these essential
advantages.
In bilateral relations, factors of
power play a preponderant part. As
for limited multilateral understandings,
it would not be to underestimate the
intrinsic value of their contribution to
the organizational action which they
pursue within the framework of their
own specific objectives, to point out
that a multiplicity of sub-systems, far
from helping the establishment of a
universal order, may on the contrary
be prejudicial to it, in so far as such
sub-systems are prone to accerjtuate
differences of opinion and of interests
and to crystallize separatist tendencies.
For these reasons, it was from the .
rostrum of the United Nations General V

### 50497: The Establishment of a new international economic order

y Assembly that the sponsors of the
movement to claim international eco¬
nomic justice for the benefit of dev¬
eloping countries needed to raise the
problem of a new world economic
order and to put forward their ideas
on that subject in order to pass them
on to the whole human community.
And it is a subject for legitimate gra¬
tification that this was indeed done
thanks to the initiative of Mr. Houari
Boumedienne, President of the Demo¬
cratic and Popular Republic of Algeria.
Thus, on May 1, 1974, the United
Nations General Assembly, meeting in
special session, adopted a Declaration
on the Establishment of a New Inter¬
national Economic Order.
Some of the principles of this new
order, as set out in the U.N. Declar¬
ation, are, in part, a restatement of
ideas which, both in form and sub¬
stance, belong to what might be called
the traditional United Nations ideology.
These principles are: sovereign
equality of States, self-determination of
all peoples, non-interference in the
internal affairs of other States, co¬
operation of all States based on equity,
whereby the prevailing disparities in
the world may be banished and pros¬
perity secured for all, the right of
every country to adopt the economic
and social system that it deems to be
the most appropriate for its develop¬
ment, the right of peoples under colo¬
nial and racial domination to achieve
their liberation, the extending of
assistance to developing countries and
peoples under colonial domination, ex¬
tension of active assistance to develop¬
ing countries by the whole interna¬
tional community, free of any political
or military conditions.
Unesco, which has always been in
the vanguard of ideological move¬
ments within the United Nations, has
in recent years taken up an increas¬
ingly militant attitude in promoting
these ideas.
But the Declaration also contains
ideas which, while not being com¬
pletely original from an intellectual
point of view, had never before been
stated so unequivocally in a United
Nations text of an essentially political
nature.
For example:
"the active, full and equal parti¬
cipation of the developing countries
in the formulation and application of
all decisions that concern the interna¬
tional community", the necessity for
which is explained by "irreversible
changes in the relationship of forces";
"preferential and non-reciprocal
treatment for developing countries" in
international economic co-operation;
this calls, in effect, for the introduction
of a kind .of positive discrimination in
favour of countries which are econo¬
mically weak, in order to redress the
inequalities of the present international
economic system;
"full permanent sovereignty of
every State over its natural resources
and all economic activities". This
involves, among other things, "the
inalienable right"... "to nationalization
or transfer of ownership to its natio¬
nals";
"the strengthening, through indi¬
vidual and collective actions, of mutual
economic, trade, financial and tech¬
nical co-operation among the develop¬
ing countries, mainly on a preferential
basis."
The adoption of such principles by
the international community is obvious¬
ly likely to bring about significant
changes in economic relationships
between States. But, precisely be¬
cause of the importance of these
innovations, they can only be adopted
by governments as sincerely as is
desirable if the people themselves
understand the true meaning of the
principles and subscribe whole¬
heartedly to their implications. This
means that a great effort to promote
explanation and reflection must be
made in allcountries.
Unesco cannot claim to be parti¬
cularly well qualified to undertake the
technical analysis of the strictly eco¬
nomic implications. It must leave this
undoubtedly high priority task to trie
organizations of the United Nations
system which deal with economic and
financial matters. But it is reasonable
to believe that, within the framework
of its own far-reaching intellectual and
ethical mission, and more particularly
in the context of its action to promote
peace and development, Unesco is in
a position to make a useful contribu¬
tion to reflection on the ideas in ques¬
tion by laying emphasis on the need
for scientific objectivity and the pro¬
motion of justice.
Moreover, the Declaration has some
omissions which should be made good.
The main one concerns the social and
cultural dimension of development.
This is understandable, of , course,
since the principal aim of those who
took the initiative of requesting the
convening of a special session of the
General Assembly and of preparing
the draft Declaration and the Pro¬
gramme of Action to implement the
Declaration was to focus the attention
of the international community on the
basic economic conditions of a new
world order.
In this they were perfectly justified
both for reasons inherent in the situa¬
tion arising out of the financial and
economic crisis which is upsetting
international relationships, and for
essential considerations relating to the
fundamental nature of economic fac¬
tors in the determining of those inter-

national relationships and the infra¬
structure of development.
However, once these economic
bases have been established it is
necessary none the less to recall the
essential importance of social and cul¬
tural factors for the twofold reason
that the social element is an integral
part of development, and of any enter¬
prise for international justice.
The social element is an integral
part of development. There can be no
going back on this decisive gain of
the First Development Decade, which
is now universally accepted. We
realize now that development involves
more than mere expansion, that it is
not to be measured simply in terms
of average incomes. It is basically a
human process of which man himself,
in all his complexity, is the alpha and
omega, the agent and the end, the
subject and measure.
Specifically social questions such as
employment or the distribution of the
national income are thus at the heart of
development problems, and basic social
services such as health and education
are among the most urgent require¬
ments and demands of ordinary people
and, as such, are yardsticks by which
actual development can be measured,
both subjectively and objectively.
But we must go even further. The
term social must be interpreted in its
broadest and loftiest sense, to include
and give expression to the cultural
element as well. The social reality of
development is something much more
than material well-being. Human
dignity is at least as important a part
of it as happiness, and that dignity
is meaningless except in relation to
those values which make life worth
living and of which culture is both
the custodian and critic, the repository
and the originator.
The imprecise but at least sugges¬
tive term "the quality of life" expresses
this twofold demand for happiness and
dignity, a demand incomprehensible
without reference to culture, which our
contemporaries, and particularly the
younger generation, are coming more
and more to see as the criterion of
genuine development. Environmental
problems have suddenly brought out
its immense significance, challenging
as it does the whole of Industrial civi¬
lization and its very basis.
For many countries whose econo¬
mies are far from having reached the
level of the industrial civilization, ex¬
pansion is admittedly an essential
requirement for overcoming bitter pri¬
vations and scarcities. Even so, the
establishment of a new system of rela¬
tions between developed and develop¬
ing countries cannot possibly overlook
the social and cultural considerations
to which I have just referred.
Moreover, the serious difficulties of
specifically cultural origin which the
aid given to these countries has run
up against, particularly as regards the
transfer of technology, are always
there to remind us, if any reminder
were needed, of this fundamental
aspect of the problems of develop¬
ment.
Lastly, there is a vital corollary to
the ideas expressed in the Declaration
which was not included in it and
which, in my opinion, should receive
Unesco's attention: the notion of jus¬
tice which, on reading the Declara¬
tion, we find is the basis of its ideo¬
logy, and which in this text is applied
solely to relations between States.'
However, justice by definition is mean¬
ingless if it cannot be claimed in res¬
pect of all aspects of man's estate.
It cannot therefore be restricted to
international and more especially inter-
State relations. It must also prevail at
the national level so as to affect the
actual situation of peoples and indivi¬
duals.
It is the same with development.-
For too long now we have been
content with defining and measuring it
by criteria and parameters which are
only total or average figures on a com¬
munity scale, as for example the Gross
National Product or per capita income.
Contrary to so many economists who
remain enslaved by these abstractions,
the President of the International
Bank, Mr. Robert McNamara, has had
the great merit of emphasizing for
several years past what is patently
true, that is, in order to evaluate a
country's genuine development, the
distribution of wealth within the com¬
munity is quite as important as its
total volume.
There again Unesco must not hesi¬
tate to take vigorous promotional, intel¬
lectual and moral action. Whether the
social aspect is discovered at the
national level through the international
order, or whether the organization
of international relationships is ap¬
proached in the light of the require¬
ments of equity towards peoples in
their actual national conditions, jus¬
tice is indivisible and exists only in so
far as the utmost is done to make it
complete.
It is not, of course, for Unesco to
intervene in the internal political
affairs of States unless asked to do
so. But it is important that both its
Member States and Unesco itself
should be thoroughly convinced that
aid for development is not a purely .
technical operation in which means r

### 50497: The Establishment of a new international economic order

Wand methods are the only questions
arising.
Such action, when it is studied in
sufficient depth, is bound to lead to
reconsideration of existing objectives
and structures. This is because dev¬
elopment is not merely economic
growth, but essentially social and cul¬
tural change, and because such
change must in every case be made
in the interests of justice.
We cannot be satisfied with a
situation where a State is rich
and powerful and its leaders are
able to express and defend their views
on the world stage if broad sections
of its population continue to live in
want, ignorance and a passivity bor¬
dering on alienation. National econo¬
mic indépendance, following on from
political independence, must go hand
in hand with a corresponding eman¬
cipation of the people this is the
very definition of social progress.
WHETHER it is a matter of
defining and promoting the
ideas contained in the Dec¬
laration or of shaping and carrying
out the Programme of Action designed
to make these ideas a reality, the
United Nations system has been
given an opportunity, rich in ex¬
ceptional possibilities and fraught
with unprecedented responsibilities,
to prove the irreplaceable nature of
its services. It is a challenge which
cannot be evaded.
But the very importance of what is
at stake makes it essential to approach
the question with lucidity and realism.
Now that the concerting of efforts has
begun and that a number of major lines
of emphasis in thought and action have
been defined, with massive support
from the Third World, one must ask in
all honesty whether the United Nations
system, with its present set up and as
it now functions, is capable of acquitt¬
ing itself satisfactorily of the increas¬
ingly heavy tasks which action for
development and the establishment of
a new international economic order
place upon it.
I do not feel able to reply to this
question in the affirmative. On the
contrary, it is my considered opinion
that in order to be able to make a
success of ,the great enterprise in
question, the United Nations system
must be considerably strengthened.
In my view, this strengthening should
be directed mainly towards the follow¬
ing points:
(a) improving the functioning and
even possibly the structures of the
competent organizations, considered
both individually and as part of the
United Nations system;
(b) increasing financial resources
and political support in proportion to
the growing importance of its object¬
ives and responsibilities.
As far as the first point is concern
ed, it must be made clear from the
start that it is most certainly not a
question of revising existing consti¬
tutional texts. In the economic, social
and cultural fields such a revision is
by no means necessary and would
even, in the present situation, which
is characterized by so many opposing
viewpoints, be a singularly hazardous
operation.
What I have in view is rather a
reappraisal, on the basis and within
the framework of the constitutions now
in force, of certain provisions concern¬
ing structure and certain of the operat¬
ing methods and practices of the
various United Nations organizations,
with a view to achieving some common
objectives of major interest.
Among such objectives one might
include, for a start, the need for a very
considerable increase in the clearly
insufficient participation by representa¬
tives of the Third World in the work
and decisions of the financial organi¬
zations of the United Nations system.
Only if this condition is met can the
measures to organize international
relations with regard to monetary
questions and to investment for dev¬
elopment be the outcome of free
discussion among the community of
nations as a whole instead of being
decided by a privileged minority.
Parallel to this however, it is only
fair that the developing countries
which have the means to do so should
appreciably increase their contri¬
butions to the resources of the orga¬
nizations in question. This last obser¬
vation applies particularly to the oil-
producing countries several of which
are now among the richest in the
world whose monetary reserves are
immense and continually increasing
and are now far greater than can be
entirely used for national development.
In the interests both of monetary
stability and of equity, it would be
advisable if a part of this capital,
which is at present floating and is
largely being invested in the developed
countries, were to be channelled,
either through the competent organi¬
zations of the United Nations system
or with their guidance, into the new
world economic order.
The International Monetary Fund
has taken or is about to take important
measures, for instance, to ensure, on
the lines described above, that the
Third World has a greater share in
international responsibilities and that
some of its countries make a larger
contribution to the resources of the
institution. This movement should be
intensified and extended to the field
of banking.
To turn to another side of the United
Nations system, that is to say, the
Specialized Agencies, I wish primarily
to sound a note of warning against the
centralizing tendencies seeking to
, restrict the autonomy of these organiz¬
ations, which come to the fore when¬
ever there is talk of reforming the
system. I regard their autonomy,
which, moreover, is formally establish¬
ed in the texts of their Constitutions,
to be essential, both in fact and by
law.
It alone can guarantee the full effec¬
tiveness and the objectivity of their
technical activities by protecting them
from the excessive interference of
politics that would be the inevitable
result of integrating them into or
subordinating them to the United
Nations organization. Such decen¬
tralization meets the need for division
of labour which is made ever more
urgent by increasing specialization.
It would run counter to the trend of
our civilization to reopen the question
of decentralization.
Having said this, the very fact that
there are a large number of Special¬
ized Agencies with widely different
functions clearly raises problems of
co-ordination if the system is to
operate smoothly, and there can be
no doubt that reforms are to be
recommended in this respect to Im¬
prove overall efficiency.
THERE remains the question, no
less important, of the resources
the United Nations system
would require to carry out its tasks
effectively, particularly those which fall
to it to establish a new world economic
order.
The economic and financial diffi¬
culties at present being experienced
by some of the most powerful countries
cannot relieve the international com¬
munity of the obligation to face up
to the problem with a proper under¬
standing of the realities and respon¬
sibilities.
On the one hand, however much the
developed countries are being affected
by the crisis, they have immense
resources which enable them if they
so wish, to contribute much more than
they do at present to the economic
and social activities of the United
Nations system. One merely has to
compare their present contribution to
these activities with the enormous
sums they spend on armaments.
On the other hand, as was said
above, certain countries of the Third
World have seen their incomes grow
substantially, to the point where six
öf them are now among the 21 States
with the largest monetary reserves.
They ought to play a greater part in
financing the system's activities for
development.
Thus whatever troubles at present
affect the balance of economic power
among nations, one can confidently
assert that the international community
as a whole possesses fully adequate
means to make the effort the rela¬
tively modest effort needed to enable
the United Nations system to fulfil its
role to the full.

### 50498: Youth hostels against racism: a world-wide movement promoting better relations between young people of all nations

World's oldest youth hostel (above),
at Altena Castle in Westphalia
(Fed. Rep. of Germany), was opened
in 1909 and is still going strong.
By providing cheap overnight
accommodation for young people
without distinction of race, nationality or
colour, the youth hostels movement
contributes greatly to international
understanding and racial equality.



by Graham Heath
YOUTH HOSTELS
AGAINST RACISM
A world-wide movement promoting
better relations between young people
of all nations
SIXTY-FIVE years ago a young
German school teacher, Richard
Schirrmann, distressed by the
plight of the underprivileged children
living in the great industrial cities of
the Ruhr, established the first youth
hostel on the edge of an unspoiled
area of wooded hills. That first youth
hostel was simple enough an empty
school building with straw-filled sacks
to serve as beds but for many young
city dwellers it provided the first
glimpse of the countryside and their
first opportunity to travel.
During the first half of the 20th
century the youth hostel idea gradu-
GRAHAM HEATH, of Great Britain, has been
associated with the youth hostel movement for
many years. He became Secretary-General to
the International Youth Hostel Federation in
1968. He is the author of a biography of the
founder of the youth hostel movement entitled
" Richard Schirrmann, The first youth hosteller. "
Published by the International Youth Hostel
Federation, Copenhagen, in 1962, it has since
been translated into five languages.
ally spread throughout Europe, and
young people with rucksacks on their
backs became a familiar sight on the
roads and footpaths of many countries.
Youth hostels had an atmosphere of
friendliness and informality which was
unusual at the time: no distinctions
were made between rich and poor,
university students and young workers,
Germans and French. The status of
the young traveller depended only on
his willingness to co-operate and make
friends.
In the years following the Second
World War, the youth hostel idea
spread to other parts of the world and
the same spirit was maintained. The
International Youth Hostel Federation,
IYHF, which was set up to co-ordinate
activities in the various national associ¬
ations, incorporated in its constitution
the principle that in youth hostels
"there shall be no distinctions of race,
nationality, colour, religion, class or
political opinions." This, it should be
noted, was at a time when the prin¬
ciples of racial equality and brother¬
hood were by no means so widely
acknowledged as they are now.
There is normally no age bar at
youth hostels. Exceptions are Switzer¬
land and Bavaria, where there is a
maximum age of 25 and 27 years res¬
pectively. Generally, however, the
hostels are intended to meet the needs
of two main groups: senior secondary
schoolchildren, university students and
young workers, travelling indepen¬
dently (the age range here being about
16 to 25), and schoolchildren travelling
with a teacher on educational visits,
and aged between about 11 and 18.
The principal contribution of the
youth hostel movement to the attack on
racism is the fact that in the 4,364
hostels throughout the world the
brotherhood of man is taken for grant¬
ed and practised quietly and without
any ostentation.

### 50498: Youth hostels against racism: a world-wide movement promoting better relations between young people of all nations

If you walk into the common-room
of a big youth hostel in Cracow or Mu¬
nich, Lahore or Canberra, you will
find young people of every race and
nationality sitting down together to
share their experiences and discuss the
world's problems. As a Malaysian boy
recently remarked: "A youth hostel
is a place where you will never feel
lost".
In accordance with its constitution,
the IYHF has never admitted to mem¬
bership youth hostel associations in
South Africa and Rhodesia, because
legislation in those countries makes it
impossible for people of different
races to share youth hostel facilities.
But an interesting new project is
under way in Lesotho, with the
financial and technical support of the
Federation: the construction of a youth
hostel specifically designed to carry
out an educational task in southern
Africa by opening its doors to young
people of all races from neighbouring
and more distant countries. Situated
just outside the capital, Maseru, the
youth hostel will also provide accom¬
modation for young people of Lesotho
attending study and training courses.
The very comprehensive statistics
maintained by the IYHF show the
movement of young people from
country to country in some detail. It
can be seen, for instance, that 10,827
"overnights" were recorded in 1972 by
young Americans in the hostels of
Japan, and 5,643 by young visitors from
India in the youth hostels of West
Germany. Although these figures are
small in absolute terms, they represent
a network of individual human contacts
among young people which can influ¬
ence outlooks and opinions at the
grass roots.
In countries where particular racial
problems exist, the national youth
hostel associations take special action
to counter them. In the United States,
for instance, the national youth hostel
association has for several years
operated an "inner-city programme"
by which underprivileged children from
the big cities are taken out on excur¬
sions into the countryside and intro¬
duced to the spirit of the youth hostel.
In the past three years some
20,000 inner-city youth, mainly black
Americans and Puerto Ricans, from
nine major cities, have participated in
this programme. Leaders have been
provided and trained by the American
Youth Hostels Association, sometimes
with the aid of outside agencies.
In England, young field officers
appointed by the English Youth
Hostel Association regularly lead
groups of underprivileged youth, many
of them immigrants, on trips to the
countryside, using funds provided by
the King George Jubilee Trust. Diane
Cunningham, one of these field offic¬
ers, organized a winter weekend trip
from London with a party of 23, includ¬
ing boys and girls from Nigeria, the
West Indies, Cyprus and other
countries. Before the weekend she
visited all the schools involved, met
the youngsters, lent them rucksacks
and gave them details of what to bring
with them.
Walking together through the
countryside of Kent, stopping on the
way to play football, enjoying the
novelty of country things (many of the
children had never been out of London
in their lives), joining with other people
in the youth hostels to cook their meals
or wash up all these were part of the
experience. By simple means such as
these the young people were intro¬
duced to a new world of beauty and
friendship.
The youth hostel movement so far
has developed mainly in Europe and
Japan, but there has been some
interesting progress in recent years in
India and Egypt, where the govern¬
ments have begun to give substantial
financial support to youth hostels as
a means of encouraging young people
to know other parts of their own
country.
In Indian youth hostels special
efforts are made to bring together
young people from different racial and
linguistic groups. An annual trekking
programme in the Himalayas involves
some 500 boys and girls from various
areas. For twelve days, the members
of each group, under expert super¬
vision, walk and climb together, cover¬
ing distances of 120 kilometres and
reaching altitudes of 4,000 metres.
Plans are in hand to involve young
people from Australia and New Zealand
in these programmes. In the south of
India, an organized cycle trail, cover¬
ing 750 miles in the Bombay-Mysore
area, involves several hundred boys .
each year, including youngsters from
cities and rural areas.
It is no wonder that leading states¬
men throughout the world have praised
the work of the youth hostels in pro¬
moting better race relations at the
grass roots. "Today, the whole world
has become our country", said Sir
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, former Pre¬
sident of India. "We wish to foster
understanding and goodwill among
nations. In this age of division we
wish to take the path of unity. It is
not our aim to have a uniform world
we wish to have a united world. That
is the reason why your movement
gives central guidance but provides for
local autonomy."
The 0ueen °f England, inaugurating
a new youth hostel in London, empha¬
sized ' the fact that it would provide
a meeting place for the young people
of all nations. "Here", she said, "they
may learn that mutual understanding
and trust, for the lack of which their
elders have so often and so bitterly
suffered."
The International Youth Hostel Fed¬
eration, which enjoys consultative
status with Unesco, is proud to be
able to play a small but practical part
in the United Nations struggle against
racism.

ENIGMAS
OF THE PLANT WORLD
OF CENTRAL ASIA
Soviet scientists study the paradoxical
botanical wealth of the Pamirs
THE Pamirs, a region of high
mountains in Soviet Central Asia,
has been called since far off
times the "roof of the world". Today
its .ancient name is acquiring some
new meanings.
Climbing high into these mountains,
one finds that the "roof" of the Pamirs
is formed by glaciers, crystal-clear
streams and patches of fields bordered
by boulders. Like a coherent and well-
co-ordinated piece of engineering, it
rises high over the world.
Resourceful Nature has provided a
reservoir of water in the form of a
solid ocean thousands of square kilo¬
metres of glaciers, the only way of
preserving water for the arid valleys
of the Pamirs. These glaciers feed
over 300 rivers and streams which
bring water and life to the valleys.
Without them the scorching sun would
turn the green fields into barren
deserts.
These great mountains, among the
highest in the world, bring bread and
water alike to the vast territories of
Central Asia, and now scientific
research is shedding new light on their
role as a provider of nourishment.
From the end of the 13th century
almost until the 19th, the only source
of knowledge about the Pamirs was ^

I « *
W this description by the famous traveller
~ Marco Polo. "For 12 days," he wrote,
"our route lay along this elevated
plain, which is named Pamer; and as
during all that time you do not come
across any habitations, it is necessary
to make provision accordingly. So
great is the height of the mountains,
that no birds are to be seen near their
summits; and however extraordinary
it may seem, it was found that from
the keenness of the air, fires do not
give the same heat as in lower
situations, nor produce the same effect
in cooking food."
This view of the Pamirs as a grim
and desolate mountainous country
prevailed for many centuries. Even
the great explorer Alexander Humboldt,
who crossed the whole of Russia right
to her eastern border in 1829, had to
make do with unreliable sources when
he mentioned the Pamirs in his work.
The situation changed just over a
hundred years ago, in the summer of
1871, with the first scientific expedition
to the northern foothills of the Pamirs.
The expedition was led by the well-
known Russian naturalist and explorer
Alexei P. Fedchenko, and collected the
first accurate information about the
Pamirs. In the 20th century, the "roof
28
of the world" has attracted the special
attention of biologists, with the famous
expeditions led by the Russian plant
geneticist Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov,
one of the founders of the scientific
principles of modern plant-breeding.
The Pamirs came into scientific
prominence with a seemingly unim¬
portant event: Vavilov's discovery
during an expedition of a hitherto
unknown variety of rye. But this find
later came to be viewed as the first
link in the chain of his discoveries: his
theory of the world centres of origin
of cultivated plants and his law of the
homologous series of hereditary adapt-
iveness. "This alone made the journey
to the Pamirs worth while," he wrote
later.
Exploration of the Pamirs and other
isolated mountain regions in the world
has revealed that they were the
sources from where the world's
cultivated plants originally came. The
mechanism of their distribution was
studied by Vavilov through the
example of "rye, of which he found
many varieties in the Pamirs. He
followed its distribution from low-lying
areas with warm climates, where rye
is looked on as a weed in wheat fields,
to highlands with climates unfavourable
to agriculture but where rye has been
gradually introduced as a food crop.
What is true of vertical plant distri¬
bution must also be true of horizontal
plant distribution. Moving further
north, cultivated plants meet in¬
creasingly severe weather conditions.
From the foothills of those isolated
mountain regions which, due to
prevailing natural conditions, produce
the widest variability of strains of
cultivated plants, food crops extend
over an immense area, from Meso¬
potamia to Siberia and throughout
Europe as far as the limits of crop
farming.
The ancient centres of world
civilization should not pride themselves
overmuch on their achievements, when
one thinks what these piles of rocks,
once thought to be desolate, have
produced. "In the past man did not
achieve his * greatest successes in
farming in low-lying sub-tropical and
tropical zones with their rich natural
resources and flourishing vegetation,
but in zones bordering deserts, in
mountains, overcoming enormous diffi¬
culties and fighting for every patch of
land," wrote Nikolai Vavilov in his
report on the agricultural development
of the Pamirs.

dens; in the background can

of fertility and desolation;

onions" (below).

Ecologists are particularly interested
in research into "extreme" living
conditions: in high mountain plateaux,
in deserts, in the polar regions. In
such conditions a plant's living
functions undergo distinctive changes
which make it resistant to the un¬
favourable effects of its surroundings.
All plant geneticists dream of dev¬
eloping and putting to use this
adaptive faculty in living organisms.
There is much more to be said,
however, about plant life in the Pamirs.
Visitors to Khorog, the main town of
Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Re¬
gion (Tadzhik S.S.R.) are invariably
astonished by the great, almost un¬
natural, height of the local poplars.
A French scientist, G. Bonnier,
experimenting with various plants in
the Alps and the Pyrenees, worked
out the rule that the higher the
mountains the smaller the plants which
grow there. And yet in the Pamirs, at
an altitude of some 2,000 metres, these
poplars have grown to giant size.
Meticulous research into this
phenomenon was carried out over
several decades, involving many ex¬
peditions led by prominent scientists.
The Soviet government has spared
neither effort nor money to encourage
the agricultural development and ex¬
ploration of the high mountain regions.
As early as 1928 there was an
expedition to the Tadzhik Pamirs, and
exploration of the heart of the Pamirs
and its riches took a step further in
1934, with the Pamirs expedition
sponsored by the Lenin Central Asia
University. This expedition led to the
establishment of permanent scientific
centres, a biological station in the
eastern Pamirs and Botanical Gardens
in the west.

y The Botanical Gardens are a
spectacular sight. In a setting some
2,100 to 3,800 metres high grow plants
brought from Central and Eastern Asia,
the Crimea and the Caucasus, Europe
and North America. And there are not
just one or two representative varieties
there are between 130 and 200
species. Here Amur cork and Penn¬
sylvania bird-cherry, American oak and
California ash, Far Eastern aralia and
Siberian larch grow side by side. The
Botanical Gardens also boast 90 strains
of apple, 38 of apricot, 15 of peach,.
14 of pear, 20 of plum, etc.
It is a magical scene, and especially
startling when one remembers that
these are the "desolate" Pamirs. Not
only have these plants from the diffe¬
rent continents of the world become
acclimatized here, they have also
revealed remarkable new properties.
Here the oak grows at .a rate of three
metres a year and yields acorns when
four years old. A tomato plant pro¬
duces up to 11.5 kilos of tomatoes.
Potato tubers' weigh two kilos each,
and sunflowers send bunches of some
50 flowers shooting out from a single
stem.
One might argue that all these
amazing things happen in a garden
made and tended by man. What
actually happens in natural surround¬
ings is shown by the case of the
walnut-tree. Till recent times nobody
in the Pamirs cultivated walnut-trees.
There was a superstition that anyone
who planted one would die. And yet
there are now varieties of walnut
growing in the Pamirs with an oil
content and nut yields superior to
those of world-famous strains.
The reason for this is natural
selection, thanks to the many species
of walnut-tree in the Pamirs. The same
is true of apple-trees. According to
Professor Anatoly V. Gursky, the first
director of the. Botanical Gardens,
about 90 per cent of the apple-trees
grown by man in the Pamirs originate
from wild species.
ANOTHER curious fact was the
discovery of an unknown
variety of poplar at the
Khaburabat Pass. So far it has not
been established whether it is a,
hybrid or a spontaneous polyploid
(a plant whose germ plasms are ar¬
ranged in several sets of chromo¬
somes). Whatever the case may be,
this poplar is outstanding for its
colossal power of growth and un¬
commonly large leaves. Spontaneous
polyploids are preponderant among
the main cultivated plants, showing
that the Pamirs was and still is a
region producing a wide variety of
plants. This discovery encouraged
scientists to set about unravelling the
region's botanical mysteries.
It is now accepted that trees and
shrubs in the Pamirs grow faster and
yield bigger crops than those on the
plains because they develop between
two and three times more buds.
This process, known as fasciation,
occurs frequently, causing neighbouring
shoots, flowers and fruits to join and
grow together in one piece.
Experiments have revealed that
growth and ' fruit-bearing are most
active at a height of 2,000 to 2,500
metres. Scientists are anxious to get
to the bottom of this puzzle, and this
is why a few years ago the Biological
Institute of the Pamirs was founded.
Its director is Khudoyor Yusufbekov,
once a herdsman and now a leading
scientist and a Corresponding Member
of the Tadzhik Academy of Sciences.
The first' and simplest explanation
of the phenomenon is that ultraviolet
radiation, whose intensity in the Pamirs
is 50 per cent higher than normal,
boosts plant growth. But a. series of
experiments conducted by Professor
Yelizaveta K. Kardo-Sysoyeva, in which
the short-wave region of the solar
spectrum was cut off, revealed that
ultraviolet emission alone was not the
cause. The mountain light acts upon
plants as a whole, and the air in the
Pamirs has a high degree of trans¬
parency and dryness which promote
an intense solar reaction.
Moreover, the carbon dioxide con¬
tent of this mountain air is only half
as much as that of the air on the plains.
How does this affect plants? And why
do they withstand such enormous
temperature fluctuations: 30° C. below
zero in November-March and 35°
above zero in July? It is also worth
mentioning that on calm nights in the
Pamirs chilly air descends upon the
valleys and creates so-called frosty
depressions.
The experiments with ultraviolet
rays provided some answers to these
questions. The intense ultraviolet
irradiation strengthens the plants'
resistance to low temperatures. But
scientists now tend to believe that a
unique combination of local conditions
enables the plant to use its latent
reserves. In the words of the Russian
scientist, Ivan M. Sechenov: "The
organism sustaining its own existence
without the environment is impossible;
therefore a scientific determination of
the organism must include the medium
which affects it."
And so the biologists of the Pamirs
still Jiave before them a considerable
task, which is of great importance
for farming. When the mystery of this
rapid growth and these bumper crops
has been explained, man will be able
to exercise full control over the crops
he grows.
The scientific and technological re¬
volution has provided man with new
farm implements, boosted agricultural
production and, above all, opened up
many more possibilities to plant-
breeders. Biologists have made break¬
throughs which entitle us to hope that
strains of high-yield plants can be bred,
and above all strains of high-yield
cereals.
Academician Dmitri D. Brezhnev, of
the Lenin Ail-Union Academy of Agri¬
cultural Sciences in Moscow, believes
30
that the concept of an ideal grain
species includes qualities such as a
yield capacity of some 10 metric tons
per hectare; a firm stalk which will
not get beaten down; resistance to
major diseases and poor environmental
conditions; early ripening and a top-
quality kernel with high content of
protein and indispensable amino-acids.
But special genetic stock is needed to
breed such an "ideal" strain.
A number of international organ¬
izations are tackling this problem,
experimenting with a stock of different
strains built up by plant genetics
throughout the world. Distinguished
plant geneticists from many countries,
including the U.S.S.R., are working
with these international bodies. At the
International Maize and Wheat Im¬
provement Centre in Mexico, Nobel
Prize-winner Norman E. Borlaug, head
of the World Spring Wheat Programme,
and his co-workers succeeded in
breeding new strains of corn which
have increased the yield capacity of
crops in South Asia (See "Unesco
Courier", February 1972).
ANY scientific institutions of
CMEA (Council for Mutual
Economic Assistance) member
countries are taking an active part in
this world-wide effort, collecting stock
for the plant geneticists to work from.
The Ail-Union Institute of Crop Hus¬
bandry (U.S.S.R.), the Institute of Gen¬
etics and Plant-Breeding (Bulgaria),
the State Institute of Agrobotanics
(Hungary), and scientific institutions in
other Socialist countries have orga¬
nized scores of expeditions specifically
to explore those areas of the world
where cultivated plants are known to
have originated.
This joint effort has led to the
collection of 325,000 plant species and
varieties. One third of them are
studied annually in various ecological
conditions, and this, research has
produced a vast amount of ex¬
perimental data and led to important
practical results.
In the U.S.S.R., 1,600 strains bred
by the scientists of Bulgaria, the
German Democratic Republic, Hungary
and Czechoslovakia have been tested,
and 5,000 strains developed in the
Soviet Union have been put through
their paces in other Socialist countries.
The grain farmers of Bulgaria and
Hungary have grown the Soviet
Bezostaya-I wheat strain and harvested
an extra 750,000 tons of wheat. In
Czechoslovakia, the Mironovskaya-808
wheat strain yielded an extra 181,000
tons of wheat. The co-operating
countries will also produce more
potatoes, sugar-beet, maize, barley and
other crops from new strains grown by
the plant geneticists of Hungary,
Poland, the German Democratic Rep¬
ublic, U.S.S.R. and Czechoslovakia.
One thing which complicates the
plant geneticist's task is that man in¬
herited from his ancestors a rich
choice of cultivated plants which pro-

### 50499: Enigmas of the plant world of Central Asia; Soviet scientists study the paradoxical botanical wealth of the Pamirs

vide him with food. As more and more
land came into cultivation, the primitive
varieties were gradually ousted, but
it is these primitive varieties which
preserve the reserves of genetic varia¬
bility. Today, when conditions for bree¬
ding an "ideal strain" exist, the role
of the genetic stock is more important
than ever and thus the world's vege¬
tation resources must be fully mobi¬
lized.
This explains why the world's
scientists are gravely concerned about
the extinction of certain species, and
why the task of conserving the earth's
genetic riches has become a global
problem. The importance of the Pamirs
in current research is expressed in
Nikolai Vavilov's conclusion that the
places where cultivated plants orig¬
inated are also the areas where they
grow in greatest diversity, providing
rich sources of plant breeding stock.
The Head of the Genetics and Piant-
Breeding Section of the Pamirs Bio¬
logical Institute, Fazrullah Nigmatullin,
discovered during an expedition an
unknown variety of wheat, which would
not have survived in any other region
but the isolated and mountainous
Pamirs. This find is of botanical
interest, but it also has a bearing on
major problems facing modern genetics
and plant-breeding.
Moreover, the biologists at the
Pamirs Institute have had long-estab¬
lished scientific contacts with Soviet
physicists. Anyone unaware of this
association and its history may be
surprised to learn that an installation
at the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic
Energy in Moscow has been named
after the Pamirs. What connexion
could there be between research into
the atomic structure of hydrogen and
the experiments conducted by the
Pamirs biologists?
The answer is that the director of
research at the Moscow "Pamirs"
installation, Yuri L. Sokolov, spent
about 14 years in the Pamirs, where
he met Professor A.V. Gursky and
took part in his research. Later, Soko¬
lov informed Academician I.V. Kur¬
chatov of the experimental work being
carried out by the biologists in the
Pamirs, and in 1957 the Pamirs Bota¬
nical Gardens received from the
Moscow physicists a portable spectro¬
meter made at the Institute of Atomic
Energy, and later a quartz monochro-
mator for studying the power distri¬
bution of solar radiation over the
spectrum.
This was the start of close collab¬
oration between physicists, who seek
to harness thermonuclear energy for
man's benefit, and biologists, who study
photosynthesis the process by which
plants use solar energy to convert
water, carbon-dioxide and minerals
into oxygen and energy-rich com¬
pounds. Today, in the Pamirs, rightly
called "Nature's Laboratory", these
scientists, using ultra-modern equip¬
ment, are gradually resolving the
mysteries of the world of plants.

Because of the extraordinary fecundity and diversity of plant life high in
the Pamirs, the region has become an important centre of research into
the conditions of plant growth. Biologists are trying hard to find out
why trees and shrubs should yield heavier crops at this great height than
on the plains below. Above, research worker at the Pamirs Biological Institute
measures the intensity of sunlight using a heliograph. Below, planting
trees at a height of 3,800 metres.

Letters to the Editor
'LOST TREASURES'
OF THE CINEMA...
Sir,
While highly appreciating the article
"Lost Treasures of the Cinema" In
the September 1974 issue of the
"Unesco Courier", I want to draw
your attention to an error in this
article.
Both on pages 6 and 7 it is stated
that D. W. Griffith's famous 1919 film,
Broken Blossoms is lost forever. The
statement is not correct. This film
does exist in its full length. I have
seen it. The copy is in the possession
of the Budapest film archive.
When Broken Blossoms was origi¬
nally shown In Budapest, one of the
best Hungarian poets wrote a prologue
to the film, and Griffith's great work
was projected together with this pro¬
logue. It is of remarkable poetic value,
and it can be found In the volume of
the Collected Works of the poet, Arpad
Toth.
G. Timar
Budapest, Hungary
...STILL WELL & THRIVING
Sir,
I read Bhagwan D. Garga's article
with the greatest interest. But, as a
specialist In the history of the cinema
(author of 25 books on the subject,
Honorary President of the Société des
Ecrivains de Cinéma et de Télévision
and of the Union Internationale de la
Critique du Cinéma, Vice-President of
the Société d'Histoire du Cinéma, and,
in particular, author of a book on the
French film director, Jacques Feyder)
I would like to correct a serious error.
Copies of Jacques Feyder's film,
L'Atlantide, still exist in a number of
cinematheques, and the film has been
screened on the occasion of several
programmes paying tribute to its direc¬
tor. On the other hand, another of
Feyder's films, Thérèse Raquin, taken
from the novel by Emile Zola, is indeed
lost for ever. An official organization
such as yours should verify facts
before publishing them.
Charles Ford
Paris, France
Sir,
The film "Broken Blossoms" is not
yet lost. It was shown on the second
channel of Spanish television, on Sep¬
tember 1.
Jesus Pinto Cosgaya
Seville, Spain
Editor's note: We wish to point out
that the errors indicated In the above
letters are not contained In the article,
"Lost Treasures of the Cinema" by
Bhagwan D. Garga. They are found in
the photo captions accompanying the
author's text. Hence Mr. Garga's
authority and reliability can in no way
be incriminated. The photo captions
were prepared by the Paris staff of
the 'Unesco Courier' with the help
of a writer on the history of the cinema
and were then submitted for verification
and accuracy to the Cinémathèque
Française in Paris. We regret the
occurrence of these errors and take full
responsibility for them. We are de
lighted that the two films indicated as
lost are in fact well and thriving,
unlike countless others which Mr. Garga
describes so well in his article.
SOFIA'S UNDERGROUND
MUSEUM
Sir,
Bravo for your article about the
underground museum of Roman and
medieval remains In Sofia which ap¬
peared in your April 1974 Issue. The
very existence of such a museum is
a healthy sign for the future of popular
culture. The authorities of the Bulga¬
rian capital deserve praise for this fine
achievement, which proves that a
people's culture does not necessarily
have to be locked behind bars or kept
under guard.
Xavier Ripoli
Barcelona, Spain
Sir,
Please accept my low bow in Russian
fashion and my great thanks for the
article "35 Steps to Antiquity" (April
1974). I remember my visit to Sofia
and its underground street passages
which are extraordinary, especially so
when one enters them for the first time.
It is a delight, a bewilderment and
pleasant sadness all at once. The
" Unesco Courier " helps me a lot in
my work as a teacher.

THREATS TO PRIVACY
Sir,
Your issue on " The Threat to Pri¬
vacy " (July 1973) marking the 25th
anniversary year of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, was full
of interest and surprises.
Progress in the micro-miniaturization
of electronic equipment Is quite fan¬
tastic, but it is also alarming to see
how It is used for spying, eavesdrop¬
ping and generally invading the right
to privacy. Equally disturbing are
brainwashing techniques which can be
used to modify a person's Ideas and
personality.
The situation calls for even greater
efforts by the United Nations and for
international legislation to curb such
activities, which directly threaten the
human freedoms that have been won
by great sacrifice and effort.

DEMOGRAPHIC AND
ECONOMIC GROWTH
Sir,
Your May 1974 issue dealing with
World Population Year was first rate.
I was particularly interested in Julian
L. Simon's article on population growth
and economic development since it
referred to research on this question
which I carried out with Prof. Alfred
Sauvy.
Mr. Simon states that Prof. Sauvy and
I "analyzed the relationship between
demographic and economic growth in
the 1960s for various samples of up
to 76 Less Developed Countries... ". I
would like to make it clear that the
results of our analysis were not simply
based on a limited number of carefully
chosen countries, but relate to data
from all the 76 countries In question.

ONE HUMAN RACE
Sir,
I enjoyed the outstanding letter from
C. Gillard, of France (January 1974)
discussing your magazine's use of the
word "races". An international body
such as Unesco should not make use
of this erroneous term.
There is a mass of scientific knowl¬
edge substantiating the existence of
one "human race". In this city in
which I live untold suffering could have
been avoided had such a simple concept
been expressed.
Ralph Newlig
Waterbury, Connecticut
U.S.A.
Editor's Note: Yes, we are all mem¬
bers of the 'human race' but the use
of the word " race " to describe differ¬
ent ethnic groups is not erroneous.
Different races do exist and sociolo¬
gists, anthropologists, etc., all use the
term. What Is erroneous is to think
of different races In terms of inferiority
or superiority.
ENERGY FOR THE ASKING
Sir,
Your extremely interesting and im¬
portant article " Our Dwindling Energy
Sources " (January 1974) shows that a
nuclear energy supply is badly needed
but still insufficiently available, expens¬
ive and uncertain. May I remind you
that in reply to a query on my part, in
the Letters Page of your January 1968
issue, you wrote: " the atomic energy
piled up in nuclear weapons can be
reverted and made useful for peaceful
purposes."
The stored energy now totals some
hundreds of thousands of megatons.
What a vast amount of energy, immedi¬
ately available if the world were wise!
Who will take the initiative?
A. Loeff
Rotterdam, Netherlands
INEXPENSIVE WEATHER TOOL
Sir,
An avid reader of the "Unesco Cou¬
rier" and an amateur weather snoop, I
found your issue on meteorology (Aug¬
ust-September 1973) a real delight, and
the section for young people especially
interesting. I would like to add a
suggestion for an inexpensive weather
indicator, consisting of dry blotting
paper (white) to which one adds a wet
mixture of two parts of cobalt chloride
to one part of salt (halite, or rock salt).
On drying it will quickly adjust to
hygrométrie changes In weather pat¬
terns. (A word of warning; cobalt
chloride is poisonous if taken intern¬
ally). In a well-ventilated weather box
area, I have found this to be an
inexpensive weather tool.

Amadou Mahtar M'Bow
of Senegal proposed as
Director-General of Unesco
Mr. Amadou Mahtar M'Bow of Senegal
has been officially nominated to be the
new Director-General of Unesco. Unesco's
Executive Board, meeting in Paris on Sep¬
tember 20, voted unanimously to propose
Mr. M'Bow as its candidate for Director-
General to Unesco's General Conference.
In accordance with Unesco's Constitution,
Unesco's Executive Board nominates a
single candidate for the post of Director-
General. The election of the Director-
General is scheduled to take place on
November 14 during Unesco's General
Conference now in session.
If elected, Mr. M'Bow, who has been
Assistant Director-General for Education
since 1970, will replace Mr. René Maheu
of France, who has been Director-General
for the past 12 years and is not a candidate
for a third term.
Mr. M'Bow, who was born in Dakar in
1921, would be the first African from a
state south of the Sahara to head a
Specialized Agency of the United Nations.
In Senegal, Mr. M'Bow twice served as
Minister of Education and once as Minister
of Culture and Youth. He has been as¬
sociated with Unesco since 1966, first as
head of the Senegalese Delegation to the
Unesco General Conference, then as
member of the Unesco Executive Board,
and for the past four years as Assistant
Director-General.
Portugal rejoins Unesco
Portugal rejoined Unesco on Septem¬
ber 11, when the Portuguese government
deposited the instrument of acceptance of
the Unesco Constitution.
Portugal was a member of Unesco from
1965 to 1972. It withdrew after the Unesco
General Conference had excluded it from
Unesco activities and had decided to
back the liberation movements in the
African territories under Portuguese admin¬
istration.
International Literacy
Awards for 1974
Two Unesco-sponsored prizes in literacy
have been awarded to educators in Pakis¬
tan and Rwanda. The 1974 Mohammad
Reza Pahlavi Prize, donated by the
Shahinshah of Iran, went to the All Pakis¬
tan Women's Association which organizes
literacy activities in 90 districts of Pakistan.
The 1974 Nadezhda K. Krupskaya Prize,
from the U.S.S.R. Government, was
awarded to the Circle for Development of
the Commune of Shyorongi in Rwanda.
The Circle's volunteer teachers last year
operated 11 literacy centres for 1,300
learners. The awards were presented by
Unesco's Director-General, Mr. René
Maheu, on International Literacy Day, Sep¬
tember 9.
For the Mohammad Reza Pahlavi Prize,
honourable mentions went to Radio
" Fides " of Bolivia; Dr. Roderlch Thun of
the Fed. Rep. of Germany, founder of the
Central American Institution for Adult
34
Education; the Provincial Literature Bureau
and Bunumbu Press of Bo, Sierra Leone;
and the Gezira' Scheme in the Sudan.
Honourable mentions made for the
Krupskaya Prize went to the National
Direction for Adult Education, Argentina;
Jean-Pierre Grossenbacher of Switzerland,
a functional literacy expert working in
Dahomey; the Bengal Social Service
League; and Mohammad Bagman Beigui,
a pioneer of literacy work among nomad
tribes of Iran. A special mention was
awarded to the Brazilian Movement for
Literacy, MOBRAL (honourably mentioned
in 1972).
World's first biosphere
reserves designated
A mountain area and a lake area in
Austria; a 4,000-hectare grazing region in
the Pennine Hills, U.K.; the 300-square-km.
Camargue National Reserve In France's
Rhone Delta; and a 95-square-km. section
of the Island of Mindoro in the Philippines
have been named as the world's first
biosphere reserves. They will form part of
a world-wide network of protected natural
areas for the conservation of valuable plant
and animal genetic strains and for scien¬
tific research aimed at safeguarding the
global environment. The location of the
biosphere reserves was announced at
recent meetings of the International Co¬
ordinating Council of the Unesco-sponsored
Man and the Biosphere Programme (MAB)
in Washington.
Jamaica's war on illiteracy
Jamaica has declared total war on illi¬
teracy with a bold programme to make
500,000 people literate in the next four
years. Some 50,000 volunteer teachers are
expected to be mobilized in 5,000 centres
throughout the Caribbean island during the
campaign. Unesco is helping the pro¬
gramme through its Gift Coupon scheme.
Flashes
From the latest edition of Unesco's
Statistical Yearbook:
Latest world estimates for illiteracy
show 783 million illiterates in 1970 compared
with 735 million in 1960. This rise in
absolute numbers is compensated by the
fall in the proportion of illiterates from
39.3 per cent of the world population to
34.2 per cent.
Illiterates make up only 3.6 per cent of
Europe's population but 12.7 per cent of
America's, 46.8 per cent of Asia's, and
73.7 per cent of Africa's. Although falling
everywhere, the percentage of illiteracy
among women is higher than among men.
In developing countries, higher edu¬
cation students represent only 4.2 per
cent of the population aged between 20
and 24 compared with 23.6 per cent in
industrially developed countries.
In 1970, cinemas numbered 248,000,
holding around 78 million people and
providing 27 seats for every thousand of
the world population.

### IGNORE

PHILAE
REVISITED
Photo © Henri Stierlin
Unesco's world campaign to save the monuments of Nubia began nearly 15 years ago.
It saw one of the biggest operations of archaeological excavation ever carried out and
saved many temples and monuments in Egypt and the Sudan from the waters of the
Nile. Its most gigantic achievement was the dismantling and reconstruction of the
two temples at Abu Simbel. The final phase of the international campaign aims at
rescuing the famous temples of Philae (see story page 12). Photo shows Horiis. the
ancient Egyptian god of the sun, sculpted on a pylon at Philae.
