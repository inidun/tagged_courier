Inner Serenity
This Buddhist monk's head, the epitome of inner serenity, is one of a fiost of figures surrounding
effigies of Buddha discovered some 40 years ago at Hadda, near the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul.
Excavations beneath the ruins of Hadda brought to light thousands of statues ana carved reliefs
that graced the city's temples and monasteries during the first four centuries of our era. The
sculptors of Hadda modelled their works in lime plaster or stucco while those of Gandhara to the
east, carved their sculpture from shale. Both places saw the development of an original Greco-
Buddhist school of art that flourished for several centuries, producing masterpieces of sculpture
in which the artistic concepts of Orient and Occident harmoniously intermingled.

FAILURE IN SCHOOL
This issue deals with a crucial
educational problem of our time:
school drop-outs and failure in school.
It examines this question in terms
of the relationship between the
student's social background and his
chances of success at school.
Much of the material in this issue
draws on data gathered by Unesco
during a world inquiry on the subject
and an international conference
organized by Unesco's International
Bureau of Education, in Geneva, last year.

FAILURE IN SCHOOL
AND THE
SOCIAL BACKGROUND
OF STUDENTS
by Leo Fernig
H OW far do factors in a
young person's background his
home, the economic status of his
parents, the kind of neighbourhood
he lives in affect his chances of
benefiting fully from the education
he receives?
4
LEO FERNIG has been director of Unesco's
International Bureau of Education in Geneva
since 1970. He was previously director of
the Department for the Advancement of
Education at Unesco, where from 1948 to
1970 he played a leading role in the elabo¬
ration and execution of Unesco's education
programme.
This question of the social back¬
ground of students and their chances
of success at school was the main
subject of an International Conference
on Education convened by Unesco at
Geneva in September last year and
attended by delegates from 90 Mem¬
ber States. In preparation for the
Conference, the International Bureau
of Education, now an integral part of
Unesco, had undertaken an inquiry into
how governments see the problem
and what measures they take to deal
with it (see also page 20).
The right to education is no longer a
vague ¡deal; it is incorporated into
the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, adopted in 1948 by the United
Nations, and governments now recog¬
nize that they have a duty to ensure
that their peoples have equal oppor¬
tunity to enjoy this right.
Yet, for a number of complex reas¬
ons, our systems of education still
fail to achieve the results we expect
from them. The record of the past
decades, and particularly of the 1960s,
has shown that a number of problems
arise when countries attempt to put
educational policies into effect without

N,
due regard to the social, economic
and political context of the system of
education.
Official reports submitted to the
International Bureau of Education
speak of a number of problem areas
which may be summed up briefly.
Several countries have multi-racial
populations, like Malaysia, where dif¬
ferences of culture and tradition may
have a direct, influence on school per¬
formance by the children. In other
countries, ethnic minorities pose a
similar problem; such minorities are
constantly being created, as the cur
rent history of migrant workers and
the recruitment of foreign labour in
Western Europe has shown.
Again, the difficulties of rural areas,
and of urban slums are frequently
recognized. A more recent form of
the problem is the "inner-city" on
which the United States provides evi¬
dence: "Concentrations of socio-eco-
nomically disadvantaged Americans
and rapidly increasing populations of
minority groups are clustered in the
central city areas... the resulting Im¬
pact upon the schools has been Inten¬
sified by a corresponding movement to
the suburbs by the more affluent citi¬
zens and by business and industry.
The decline of property values occa¬
sioned by these changes has resulted
in a reduction of funds for education
in the cities..."
More broadly, most of the indus¬
trially developed states remark on the
educational problems associated with
groups who are socially and economi¬
cally disadvantaged i.e. below the
national norm.
The list of problems, difficulties and
shortcomings must, however, be read
against the record of measures taken

FAILURE IN SCHOOL (Continued)
to produce solutions. These cover
an extremely wide range, from concert¬
ed action by the central government
agencies to local experimental pro¬
jects. A few examples may suffice to
demonstrate the variety of these
measures.
An integrated approach is to be
found In France, where the 6th Plan
stresses the need to develop equality
for opportunity; reforms in the organi¬
zation and content of schooling, the
extension of pre-school education in
rural areas, Increased provision for
special education and the education of
adults these are some parts of the
Integrated programme.
With the central planning approach
of the U.S.S.R., it Is relevant to quote
the 1958 law adopted by the Supreme
Soviet, which provided a series of
educational and administrative meas¬
ures to offset unsatisfactory results
that might arise from family conditions,
place of residence and from the school
system itself.
Although expressed differently,
legislation over the past two decades in
the U.S.A. has led to a vastly increas¬
ed involvement of the U.S. Govern¬
ment in educational matters, with Fed¬
eral support for many programmes des¬
igned to strengthen the education of
socially and economically disadvan¬
taged students.
Again, Israel reports a comprehen¬
sive series of measures designed spe¬
cifically for schools and children "in
need of nurture". These were institu¬
tionalized In 1963 with the establish¬
ment of a centre which serves as the
co-ordinating agency. A characteristic
of the programme is the constant feed¬
back from experimental work, which
has led to the general adoption of
measures found to be effective, while
at the same time policies and plans are
reviewed on the basis of objective
evidence.
A study of failure among working
class children in Rotterdam led to the
setting up of a socio-educational pro¬
ject which embraces six infant and ten
primary schools. Essentially the pro¬
ject aims to draw schools, families
and cultural institutions of the district
closer together, while making exten¬
sive reforms in the form and content
of school work so that it may be more
meaningful to the community.
In the U.S.A., under the Impulse of
Federal funding, a host of local pro¬
jects have developed, most of them
in disadvantaged neighbourhoods.
Characteristic features are the involve¬
ment of the local community and a
greater attention to individual differ¬
ences between pupils.
Although experimental work seems
to be common for children at pre-pri-
mary and even secondary levels, much
less appears to be done to study the
problems of, or satisfy the needs of,
adolescents who have left school.
The International Conference on
Education represented a wide range
of countries. The problems connect¬
ed with equality of educational oppor
tunity do not occur everywhere with
the same intensity, and the national
strategies for ensuring equality will
obviously vary. In this regard, it may
be noted that many developing coun¬
tries are more concerned to extend
their school systems, improve access
In other words, and less concerned
about success at school. Indeed, par¬
ticipation In the existing schools is
often more democratic than it is in
developed countries.
The Conference drew attention to
two practical considerations of con¬
siderable importance. The improve¬
ment of educational equality ¡s a means
of increasing efficiency of the school
system. And measures designed to
democratize education, since they con¬
sider individual differences, are likely
to be the most effective means for
achieving quality in education.
As the problems involved are com¬
plex, with a number of inter-actlng
factors, educational policy by itself is
not enough. All aspects of a govern¬
ment's action in the political, social
and economic fields, have a bearing
on equality of opportunity, and should
be planned with this in mind.
In terms of the education sector by
itself, the Conference outlined forms
of desirable actions. The organization
of the system of education should be
reviewed to take account of the needs
of underprivileged groups. In this
context, provisions for pre-school edu¬
cation (or falling that, improvements in
the early primary grades) are partic¬
ularly important.
At the administrative level, the siting
of schools across the national territory
is a means of overcoming regional
differences. Still more essential are
measures to ensure community parti¬
cipation in school affairs. For at the
origin of educational inequality lies the
fact of a separation between the school
and the community it serves.
The reform of curricula and of teach¬
ing methods follows from changes in
the organization of schooling.
The Conference dwelt at length on
the important role of teachers. If equa¬
lity of educational opportunity Is to be
achieved, certain clear principles can
be stated about the recruitment, train¬
ing and appointment of teachers. Thus,
for example, teachers in training
should learn about the various com¬
ponents of the social background and
should have practical experience of
social work in the community. Like¬
wise, means should be found to attract
and keep good teachers In schools in
disadvantaged areas.
Finally, admitting the complexity of
the question and our present lack of
information about the factors at work,
the conference made a strong claim
for more research work or rather,
for a combination of experimentation
and action. Both national and inter¬
national resources should be diverted
to this objective so that the schools
can progress further and really give
every child the educational oppor¬
tunity that is his due.

f\ child's chances for suc¬

by how well he does in various
examinations, his staying on in school
beyond the age required by law, his
continuing on to some form of higher
education or training are rather
directly related to his social back¬
ground. In most nations, this relation¬
ship is so direct that schools have been
accused of simply sorting pupils and
maintaining the status quo rather than
developing individual talents and
aptitudes.
In the past quarter of a century
or so, there has been a dramatic
democratization of education. This
trend has been marked by sharp
increases in numbers of pupils en¬
rolled in schools, in the variety of
educational programmes provided, and

millions of their sisters throughout the world who are still denied
education merely because they are girls.

10 OBSTACLES TO SUCCESS (Continued)
reached by most of the nations of
the world.
Despite a public commitment to
universal schooling by most govern¬
ments, in fact, large numbers of
children seem unable to profit fully
from the opportunities provided them.
Many are prevented from entering
various programmes, and many
schools seem unable to design pro¬
grammes or provide services which
meet the needs of the children and
youth they are meant to serve.
Children from lower social and eco¬
nomic classes, those from racial or
ethnic minorities, residents of inner-
city slums or isolated rural areas,
migrants, pupils whose mother tongue
differs from the language the school
uses In teaching, children from reli¬
gious and cultural minorities these
are the groups from which students
come who are less likely to succeed
in school.
Such groups are not homogeneous
that is, members of such groups are
not all alike nor are all children dis¬
advantaged simply because they are
members of such groups.
There are various factors which are
likely to hinder or obstruct learning
from the time the child enters the
classroom.
A child may be disadvantaged if he
comes from a family which is poor.
Poverty may affect the child's
chances for success in school. A
child who is constantly hungry will
have difficulty giving his full attention
to the lessons to be learned in school.
A child whose parents cannot provide
him with the clothing he needs may
be physically uncomfortable as well
as being embarrassed by being with
classmates who are better clothed.
A child who comes from a home
which is overcrowded, in which food
is In short supply or not well balanced,
where poor sanitary conditions in¬
crease the possibilities of his contract¬
ing various diseases is less likely to
be successful in coping with school
tasks. A child who observes that
the grownups around him are either
without jobs or in poorly paid jobs
is likely to develop limited ideas
about his own chances for the future.
8
A child may be disadvantaged if
he has only limited opportunities for
developing his mental abilities and
language.
The opportunities for the poor child
to develop his mental abilities and
language are more limited than of his
middle-class peers. Differences in
styles of thinking between lower-
and middle-class children can often
be traced to the ways their parents,
especially mothers, talk with them and
the kinds of family interactions which
take place.
Among the most important things
which a child brings to the classroom
is effective language. Lower-class
homes provide children with a variety
of stimuli and help develop many
skills and abilities but they often fail
to provide the kinds of experiences
which help the child to cope with the
demands made on him by the teacher.
Children from poor families often
have more problems with discrimin¬
ating or observing differences between
visual symbols or sounds, with hand¬
ling general ideas as contrasted with
concrete tasks, and with other skills
which are necessary for success in
school-related work. Thus, the school
may make demands on the young
child for which the experiences in
infancy and early childhood have not
prepared him so that he often fails
from the beginning.
A child may be disadvantaged if
there are sharp differences between
the values of his home and neigh¬
bourhood and those of the school and
the classroom.
Values, attitudes, concepts of self,
and drive to achieve are related to
social class. The values or ideals
which are important and meaningful
to the child and his family may be
different from those which guide the
actions of teachers and other school
personnel. Behaviour which is accept¬
ed and even rewarded in the home
and in the neighbourhood may be
rejected and punished by school
authorities.
The value attached to formal educa¬
tion and the importance of succeed¬
ing in school differs with various
cultural and ethnic groups. As a result,
the goals of the school may or may
not receive support in the home.
Frequently, the child is confused by
differences in what is "acceptable"
or "appropriate" behaviour In the
home or neighbourhood in contrast
with what is accepted by the school.
As the child grows and matures,
the values and the standards of
behaviour of his peers become more
and more important to him. In fact,
the peer culture may so dominate the
behaviour of youth that the student
may reject or ignore the values which
his family or the school are trying to
teach him when they are at odds
with what his peers believe are
Important. Values, attitudes, and
feelings all contribute to a prevailing
climate of a school and this climate
has a strong impact on what it is that
students learn and what they believe
is significant.
A child may be disadvantaged if he
is a member of a racial or ethnic
minority group or a lower caste.
Especially when they are visible and
identifiable, children who are members
of racial and ethnic minorities or of
lower castes which are discriminated
against by society at large may be at
a disadvantage in school. The child's
feelings about himself and his own
worth, his pride in his race or ethnic
group, his drive to achieve, and his
beliefs about his chances for success
are all affected by the discrim nation
he encounters or thinks he encounters.
The low expectations teachers and
other school personnel have for lower
class or culturally different phildren
often strengthen and reinforce the
low expectations for success the
child has for himself. Not expecting
that such pupils will succeed, teachers
may not provide effective instruction
so that when the students do fail, the
school's prediction for failure Is
fulfilled.
Schools often provide lower quality
education for racially or ethnically
different groups. Children are cis-
criminated against in the opportunities
provided them as a result of prejudices
of school personnel. In some in¬
stances, groups strive to enrich and
preserve their own culture and view
the school's efforts as aimed at its
elimination. Discriminatory practices
contribute to the failure of some
students to achieve in schools.
A child may be disadvantaged if he
is a migrant.
Children whose parents are farm
labourers travelling with crop harvest
seasons, members of nomad tribes,
gypsies, or itinerant workers may move
about steadily. The migrant child has
not known the same kind of stability
as his non-mobile peers. The migrant
child may have had a variety of
experiences and learning opportunities
but these are often either not recog¬
nized by the school or not viewed
as being important.
In many instances, the migrant child
is viewed as a burden by the school
and by other public agencies. Because

WORLDS APART. Social and cultural differences can seriously affect a child's chances for
success in school or even his (or her) chance of being enrolled. A child living in a city slum
may be as geographically isolated as one living in a remote village, in the sense that he may
have little or no contact or experience outside his immediate neighbourhood. Here, contrast¬
ing worlds are captured in one blink of the camera's eye. Children like those in the foreground
are often isolated by social barriers as rigid as the wall around the sports club and children's
playground (in background) at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

A NEW KIND
OF EDUCATION
IN RURAL NIGER
Geographical isolation means educational deprivation
for hosts of school-age children. Playtime is fun, but
are these carefree boys (right), at play in a village in
northern Niger, among the privileged few who attend
school (top right), or are they to be counted among
the vast army of outsiders looking wistfully in on a
wonderland whose doors are closed to them (above)?
In 1962, only 7 per cent of Niger children were enrolled
In schools. Today the position has greatly improved.
10 OBSTACLES TO SUCCESS (Continued)
he attends school irregularly, many
teachers simply do not know how to
cope with the migrant child and simply
tolerate such children until they move
. on. The mobile child is at a dis¬
advantage because of the inability or
unwillingness of the school to arrange
programmes which take into account
his constant moving and particular
cultural style.
10
A child may be at a disadvantage
if the language of instruction Is not
his mother tongue or dialect.
The language which the child learns
as an infant and the one he uses at
home his "mother tongue" is often
different from the language which Is
used by the teachers and the one
found in the books and materials he
uses. Thus, in addition to the other
knowledge and skills the school
requires the child to acquire for
success he may have to learn another
language.
If he has a non-standard dialect or
speech pattern, the child may be at
a disadvantage. Where the language
used by teachers differs from the
language of the home, the child must
learn to understand the instruction in
an unfamiliar tongue and to acquire
ability to use it if he is to succeed.
If his own language or dialect is
rejected or ignored by the school,
or if teachers take punitive action
towards children using non-standard
language, the child's feelings about
himself and his family can be adversely
affected.
A child may be at a disadvantage
if he lives in a geographically Isolated
area.
A child who lives in an isolated
rural region or a very small hamlet
may be at a disadvantage in terms
of the schooling provisions which can
be made for him, his ability to take
advantage of educational opportunities
because of the physical barriers, and
the existing attitudes toward the value
of schooling which may exist. His
parents, for example, may view
education as relatively unimportant
in preparing him to work at home.

but in the rural areas only I out of 10 children is admit¬
ted to the rare schools that have been established inthe
bush. The school pictured above is equipped with two
battery-powered television receivers on which the
pupils, under the guidance of a supervisor, can follow
two quarter-hour educational programmes, broadcast
morning and afternoon, from the capital Niamey.
Produced under a Franco-Niger co-operation scheme
and planned to fit into a four year elementary school
cycle, the broadcasts accelerate the learning of reading
and mathematics and include educational programmes
on a wide variety of subjects. Between 1967 and 1972,
20 bush schools have benefited from these broadcasts.
In the future, more schools will be built and the broad¬
casts will be extended to reach the village schools of
the Ivory Coast. But for a long time to come, thousands
of children, like this young Niger boy (left) will have
little hope of receiving the education they need to
cope with the changing life in the developing world.
Cultural and language differences
between rural and metropolitan regions
can affect the child's chances for
success in school. Even a child living
in an inner-city ghetto may be geo¬
graphically isolated in the sense vthat
he may have little or no contact. or
experience outside his immediate
neighbourhood except through radio
or television. Thus the gap between
the slum dweller's curriculum and the
materials provided for him and his
experiences may be no less than
that of the isolated rural child with
equal chances for failure in school.
A child may be at a disadvantage
if a girl or if a member of a particular
religious group.
The value of an education for a
girl differs with various cultures. The
expectations as to the number of
years of school necessary for girls, the
kinds of educational programmes they
should be provided with, and the desir¬
able levels of attainment are different
for various cultural groups.
In some cultures, girls are only
expected to attain a minimal level of
literacy or to do poorly in, certain areas
of study, such as mathematics or the
sciences.
Some groups resist sending girls
to school at all, especially if such
schools are jco-educational
In some societies, religious groups
differ in the value they place on edu¬
cation and the extent to which schools
are viewed as altering one's life
chances. Some religious groups, for
example, do not view schools as con¬
tributing to the social and economic
mobility of the child and, therefore, do
not put much emphasis on success in
school.
A child may be at a disadvantage
due to a variety of school factors.
The teaching personnel, pro¬
grammes, services, instructional mat¬
erials, organization, testing pro¬
cedures, and relations to the com¬
munity of which the school is ' part
all affect the child's chances for
success. Teachers who are poorly
prepared and unqualified, curricula

which are irrelevant, materials and
equipment which are inadequate and
inappropriate, personnel with un¬
realistic or low expectations for
student achievement, grouping or
streaming procedures which limit the
chances for some students, selective
schools and programmes which dis¬
criminate against children of the poor
and those of racial or ethnic minorities
all these affect the student's
success.
The educational processes in most
schools and in most societies are
dominated by the majority group so
that the opportunities for those with
different backgrounds are generally
restricted. Social backgrounds and
tho consequent segregation affect the
academic achievement of students. By
the kind of climate for learning created,
the curriculum designed, the resources
available, teachers and ad-
ninistrators can promote cultural
conflicts which put some youngsters
at a disadvantage and reduce their
chances for success In school.
Social background and success in
school.
In nations all over the world,
developed and developing, more or
less urbanized and Industrialized,
significant numbers of children enter
school at a disadvantage. They
experience initial failure or only limited
success in school in the early years
and their academic failure continues
and becomes more intense as the
years go by.
Such students tend to come from
families which are poor, are members
of racial or ethnic minority groups
or lower castes, may speak a language
or a dialect which differs from the
standard of the majority group, may
live in a geographically isolated area,
may be a female or a member of a
religious group which holds education
in low esteem, and may be a migrant
child (*). In part, the disadvantage
stems from the student's background
and environment. In part, the disad¬
vantage may stem from the school
itself. The combination of social back¬
ground and institutional factors is relat¬
ed to the student's success In school.
Equality of educational opportunity
is a concept with educational, social,
political, and economic implications.
Recognition of the relationships which
exist between the student's back¬
ground and his success in school is
a first step toward understanding the
kinds of changes which will have to
be made to improve the chances for
success for those who are now
disadvantaged for various reasons.

'LETTER TO A TEACHER'
We publish below extracts from an unusual document voicing the
protest of a group of young children against the school system.
Throughout the world the school is under attack, along with the
curriculum, teaching methods and the inequality of opportunities
open to children from different social backgrounds. This protest was
originally written by a group of boys from Barbiana, a tiny hamlet in
Tuscany, Italy. All the boys were pupils in a school founded by a young
priest, Don Lorenzo Milani, for children who were drop-outs from
the State-run schools. Published in 1967 in Italian as "Letters a una
Professoressa" (Librería Editrice Fiorentina, Florence) the book im¬
mediately became a cause célèbre and has been published in many
languages including English ("Letter to a Teacher", Random House,
New York; Penguin Books, London, 1970). Italian and other educators

Father Lorenzo Milani, who founded the Barbiana school
In the Tuscan hills about 30 miles from Florence, with four of
his pupils. When the school started in 1954 it had 10 pupils
aged from 11 to 13, but later the number of pupils doubled and
included boys up to 18 years old.

and sociologists, it is true, had previously voiced concern over the
plight of culturally disadvantaged children, especially in the rural
areas in Italy and other countries. One of the most common criticisms
was that the school was élite-orientated rather than trying to give
youngsters real preparation for life. Since the creation of the Bar¬
biana school in 1954, many changes have taken place in Italy. Accor¬
ding to Unesco statistics, 9 pupils out of 10 complete primary school
(see page 21) and 8 students out of 10 who enter the "second cycle"
of secondary education finish the course. The number of university
graduates has risen sharply, and where parents' income is below a set
level, the State now even pays certain college students a "pre-salary"
to study. "Letter to a Teacher" is written in the style of an impassion¬
ed manifesto yet it nevertheless retains its full value as an important
human document on a problem of universal import today, which is
the subject of this entire issue. Don Milani's correspondence,
just published in Italian under the title "Lettere" (Mondadori,
Milan, 325 pages) completes and complements "Letter to a Teacher."

I OU won't remember me or
my name. You have failed so many of
us.
On the other hand I have often had
thoughts about you, and the other
teachers, and about that institution
which you call "school" and about
the boys that you fail.
You fail us right out into the fields
and factories and there you forget us.
Compulsory school. After the five ele¬
mentary years I had the right to three
more years of schooling. In fact, the
Constitution says that I had the obliga¬
tion to go. But there was not yet an
intermediate school in Vicchio (The
intermediate school media inferiore
covers the ages twelve to 14)*.
To go to Borgo was an undertaking.
The few who had tried It had spent a
pile of money and then were thrown
out as failures like dogs.
In any case, the teacher had told my
family that it was better not to waste
money on me: "Send him into the
fields. He Is not made for books."
My father did ' not reply. He was
thinking, "If we lived In Barbiana, he
would be made for books."
Barbiana. In Barbiana the boys
were going to school. The priest's
school. From early morning until dark,
summer and winter. Nobody there was
"not made for school".
Barbiana, when I arrived, did not
seem like a school. No teacher, no

desk, no blackboard, no beaches.
Just big tables, around which we
studied and also ate.
There was just one copy of each
book. The boys would pile up around
it. It was hard' to notice that one of
them was a bit older and was teach¬
ing.
The oldest of these teachers was
sixteen. The youngest was twelve, and
filled me with admiration. I made up
my mind from the start that I, too,
was going to teach.
The favourite. Life was hard up there
too. Discipline and squabbles until
you didn't feel like coming back.
But there a boy who had no back¬
ground, who was slow or lazy, was
made to feel like the favourite. He
would be treated the way you
teachers treat the best student In the
clacs. It seemed as if the school was
meant just for him. Until he could
be made to understand, the others
would not continue.
The rules of good writing. After three
years of schooling at Barbiana I took,
in June, my exams for the intermediate
diploma as a private-school candidate.
The composition topic was: "The Rail¬
way Waggons Speak".
At Barbiana I had learned that the
rules of good writing are: Have some¬
thing important to say, something use¬
ful to everyone or at least to many.
Know for whom you are writing.
Gather all useful materials. Find a
logical pattern with which to develop
the theme. Eliminate every useless
word. Eliminate every word not used
in the spoken language. Never set
time limits.
That is the way my schoolmates and
I are writing this letter. That is the
way my pupils will write, I hope, when
I am a teacher.
The knife in your hands. But, facing
that composition topic, what use could
I make of the humble and sound rules
of the art of writing in all ages?. If I
wanted to be honest I should have
left the page blank. Or else criticized
the theme and whoever had thought
¡t up.
But I was fourteen years old and I
came from the mountains. To go to a
teachers' school I needed the diploma.
This piece of paper lay in the hands
of five or six persons alien to my life
and to everything I loved and knew.
Careless people who held the handle
of the knife completely in their own
grasp. So I tried to write the way you
want us to.
The trap-complex. The French exam
was a concentrate of irregularities.
Examinations should be abolished.
But if you do give them, at least be
fair. Difficulties should be chosen in
proportion to their appearance in life.
If you choose them too frequently, it
means you have a trap-complex. As if
you were at war with the boys.
What makes you do it? Is it for the
good of the students?
Owls, pebbles and fans. No, not for
their good. You gave an A in French
to a boy who, in France, would not
know how to ask the whereabouts of
the toilet. - -..
He could only have asked for owls, *~n

Using makeshift equipment, the pupils at Barbiana worked eight hours a day, six or seven days
a week, the "stronger" pupils helping the "weaker" ones, under the supervision of Father Milani

The result was that he hated French

The children they lose. Schools have

The only incompetents In the matter
of school are you who lose so many
and don't go back to find them.
Not we: we find them in the fields and

anybody who knows the pain endured
by a child when he fails, and who has
enough patience to look through statis¬
tics. Then these figures will begin to
scream in your face. Every blow is a
creature going off to work before
being equal.
Let's try to follow one class of
children throughout their eight years
of compulsory schooling.
First year. Let us drop in on a first-
year class on the first day of school, in
October. Thirty-two students are there.
At a glance they all seem alike. In real¬
ity there are five amongst them who
will sit their exams again and again.
Seven years old, aprons and rib¬
bons, yet already stamped "retarded",
which will cost them dearly later on in
the Intermediate school.
Shooting into a bush. Three children
are missing even before the school
term begins. The teacher doesn't
know them, but they have been in
school earlier. They tasted their first
failure and they have not come back.
We do not Include In our count
those children who never started
school.
In June the teacher fails six children.
To fail someone is like shooting into
a bush. Perhaps you get a boy,
perhaps a hare. We'll find out in time.
Second year. In the following October
the teacher of the seven to eight year
olds again finds thirty-two children in
her classroom. She sees twenty-six
familiar faces and feels at home again
among her own, whom she has come
to love.
A bit later she spots the six new
students. Five are repeating the year.
One of these has already repeated it
twice; he is almost nine years old.
The sixth new face Is Pierino, the
doctor's son.
Pierino. The doctor's chromosomes
are powerful. Pierino could write
when he was only five. He has no
need for a first year. He enters the
second at age six. And he can speak
like a printed book.
Only a fraction of equality. At the end
of the five elementary years, eleven
children have already disappeared
from the school, and it is their
teacher's fault.
"Schools are open to all. All citizens
have a right to eight years of school.
All citizens are equal." But what about
those eleven ? Those eleven boys
who went to work during the five ele¬
mentary years ranged In age from
seven to fourteen*.
They were mostly peasants or, in
any case, children living in isolated
communities where even the smallest
can be given something to do.
First intermediate year. In the first
intermediate year there are twenty-two
children. For the teacher they are all
new faces. She knows nothing of the
* Schooling In Italy Is free and compulsory up
to the age of 14, and check-ups on school
attendance have become increasingly strict.
eleven who were lost. She is truly
convinced that no, one is missing.
At times she allows herself to grum¬
ble: "Now that everybody comes to
school it's impossible to teach. We get
quite Illiterate students."
The oldest and the poorest. She would
also have to study the ages of the
students on her class list. Every one
of these children ought to carry a big
placard: "I am 13. Do not fail me."
And the instructors look at the marks
in their register books, not at the
birth dates.
Some of them may act in good faith.
Some may even want to save the older
students. Then, facing a pupil's paper
full of mistakes, they forget all their
good intentions.
The facts show that the oldest are
always the ones who fail. Those who
have a job within easy reach.
By failing the oldest of the children
the teachers manage at the same time
to hit the poorest.
Second intermediate year. By the sec¬
ond year of the intermediate school,
the average age of the students is
lower, since the oldest are missing.
The distance between Pierino and the
others grows less.
It can be said that the classes grow
older all through the elementary years
because of the boys who are repeating
years. Then in the intermediate school
they become younger again because
the oldest have dropped out to go to
work.
Who is she talking about? Whether
it's a matter of the age or the social
status of the students, the teacher
starts breathing freely when they
reach the second intermediate year.
She looks forward to June. Then
she will get rid of her last four thorns
and will finally have a group worthy
of her.

"When they came Into the first inter¬
mediate class, they were truly
illiterate. But now, ah, their papers
are all correct."
Who is she talking about? Where
are the boys she received in the first
form? The only ones left are those
who could write correctly to begin
with; they could probably write just as
well in the third elementary year. The
ones who learned to write at home.
The illiterate she had in the first year
are just as illiterate now. She has
simply dumped them out of sight.
Compulsory. And she knows it well.
So well that in the third intermediate
year she fails only a few. Seven fail¬
ures in first, four in second and only
one in the third. Just the opposite of
what she ought to do.
In the compulsory school system, the
compulsoriness ought to carry all the
students through to the third inter¬
mediate year. Then at a final examina¬
tion the teacher could release her
selective instincts.
We wouldn't say a word about that.
If a boy has not learned to write by
then she would do well to fail him.
Summary. In eight compulsory years
of schooling, this class has lost forty
children. Sixteen went to work before
they had completed their compulsory
years of school. Twenty-four are
repeaters. Altogether, fifty-six children
have. passed through this class. By the
third year of the. intermediate school
we find only eleven out of the thirty-
two original students entrusted to the
teacher of the first elementary class.
Born different? You tell us that you
fail only the stupid and the lazy.
Children born to others do appear
stupid at times. Never our own. When
we live close to them we realize that
they are not stupid. Nor are they lazy.
Or, at least, we feel that it might be
a question of time, that they may snap
out of it, that we must find a remedy.
Then, it is more honest to say that
all children are born equal; if, later,
they are not equal, it is our fault and
we have to find the remedy.
Who profits? Let's try to see who
profits from schools kept to a minimum
number of hours.
Seven hundred and twenty hours
per year means about two hours of
school per day averaged out over
the year. But a boy stays awake
another fourteen hours. In well-to-do
families these are fourteen hours of
cultural improvement.
But to the peasants they are fourteen
hours of loneliness and silence, good
only for deepening their shyness. To
the sons of workers they are fourteen
hours at the school of the hidden
persuaders. Advertising Is called
hidden persuasion when it convinces
the poor that unnecessary things are
necessary.
Summer holidays, In particular,
seem virtually designed for the benefit
of the rich. Their children go abroad
and learn even more than they do in
winter. But by the first day of school
the poor have forgotten even the little
they knew in June. If they have to take
any make-up exams they can't afford
a tutor to prepare for them.
Pierino's home. Perhaps the life
story of "Pierino" can give us a key.
So, let us try to take a loving look
at his family.
The doctor and his wife are up there
on top of things. They read, they
travel, they see friends, they play with
their child, they take time to keep
close track of him and they even do
It well. Their house is full of books
and culture. At five I had mastered
the shovel; Pierino, the pencil.
One evening,, as if the decision has
been brought about by the facts them¬
selves, they say half-jokingly. "Why
place him in the first grade? Let's put
him straight into the second." They
send him to take the tests without
giving it another thought. If he fails,
who cares?
But he does not fail. He gets all
9s. Serene joy fills the family, just
as it would have mine.
Pierino, then will become a pro¬
fessor. He will find a wife much like
himself. They will produce another
Pierino. More of a Pierino than ever.
Thirty thousand such stories every
year.

university student body; labourers'
sons, 13.5 per cent. Of those who get
a degree, 91.9 per cent are young
gentlemen and 8.1 per cent are from
working-class families (Italian Statis¬
tical Yearbook 1963, tables 113-14) *.
For the good of the child. "After all,
it's for the child's own good. We
must not forget that these pupils
stand at the threshold of high school ",
pompously cried the headmaster of
a little country school.
It was immediately clear that only
three of the thirty children in the
class would go on to the upper years:
Maria, the daughter of the dry-goods
merchant; Anna, the teacher's
daughter; and Pierino, of course.
But even if more of the children went
on, what difference would it make?
That headmaster has forgotten to
change the record on his record
player. He hasn't yet noticed the
growth of the school population. A
living reality of 680,000 children in the
first year. Most of them poor. The
rich, a minority **.
It's not a question of a classless
school, as he calls it. His is a one-
class school, at the service of those
who have the money to push ahead.
In Africa, in Asia, in Latin America,
in southern Italy, in the hills, in the
fields, even in the cities, millions of
children are waiting to be made equal.
Shy, like me; stupid, like Sandro; lazy,
like Gianni. The best of humanity.
The real test. When I passed my
exams and left the intermediate school
I went to England. I was 15. At first
I worked with a farmer in Canterbury;
later on with a wine merchant in
London.
Cockney. In London they are worse
off than on the farms. We worked
below ground in the City unloading
trucks. My co-workers were English,
but they could not write a letter in
English. They often asked Dick to
write for them. Dick sometimes would
ask advice from me; I who had learned
my English from records. He, too,
speaks only Cockney like the rest of
them.
The reforms that we propose.
1. Do not fail students.
2. Give a full-time school to children
who seem stupid.
3. Give a purpose to the lazy.
The turner. A turner at his lathe Is
not allowed to deliver only those
pieces that happen to come out well.
Otherwise he wouldn't make the effort
to have them all turn out well.
But you, you can get rid of the
pieces that you don't like whenever
you wish to. So you are happy taking
care of those who are bound to be
successful for reasons that lie outside
the school.
Aptitudes. Every child has enough
"aptitude" to reach the third year of
the intermediate school and to get
by in all subjects.
It is so convenient to tell a boy,
"You are not cut out for this subject."
The boy will accept this; he is just
as lazy as his teacher. But he knows
that his teacher does not consider
him an Equal.
It is not good policy to tell another
child. "You are clearly cut out for this
subject." When he has too much
fondness for just one subject, he
should be forbidden to study it. Call
his case "specialized", or "un¬
balanced". There is so much time,
later on, to lock oneself up in a
specialized field.
By piecework. If all of you knew
that, by any means possible, you had
to move every child ahead in every
subject, you would sharpen up your
wits to find a way for all of them
to function well.
I'd have you paid by piecework.
So much for each child who learns
one subject. Or, even better, a fine
for each child who does not learn
a subject.
Then your eyes would always be on
Gianni. You would search out in his
inattentive stare the intelligence that
God has put in him, as in all children.
You would fight for the child who
needs you most, neglecting the gifted
one, as they do in any family. You
would wake up at night thinking about
him and would try to invent new ways
to teach him ways that would fit his
needs. You would go to fetch him
from home if he did not show up for
class.
You would never give yourself any
peace, for the school that lets the
Giannis drop out is not fit to be called
a school.
Agrarian culture. Glancing through the
pages of a school textbook we see
plants, animals, the seasons. It seems
that only a peasant could have
written it.
But no, the authors are products of
your school. It's enough just to
glance at the pictures: left-handed
farmers, round shovels, hooked hoes,
blacksmiths with tools used in Roman
times, cherry trees with the leaves of
plum trees.
Standing by a plum tree, my first-
year teacher told me one day, "Climb
that tree and pick some cherries for
me." When my mother heard this, she
said, "Whoever gave her a teaching
licence?"
You gave her a teaching licence but
you deny me one, when I know all my
/ trees, each by each.
All alone, like dogs. You know even
less about men than we do. The lift

serves as a good machine for ignor-
. ing the people in your building; the car,
for ignoring people who travel in
buses; the telephone, for avoiding
seeing people's faces or entering their
homes.
I don't know about you, but your
students who know Cicero how many
families of living men do they know
intimately? How many of their kitch¬
ens have they visited? How many of
their sick have they sat with through
the night? How many of their dead
have they borne on their shoulders?
How many can they trust when they are
in distress?
Human culture. A thousand motors
roar under your windows every day.
You have no idea to whom they belong
or where they are going.
But I can read the sounds of my
valley for miles around. The sound
of the motor in the distance is Nevio
going to the station, a little late. If
you like, I can tell you everything
about hundreds of people, dozens of
families and their relatives and per¬
sonal ties.
Whenever you speak to a worker
you manage to get it all wrong: your
choice of words, your tone, your jokes.
I can tell what a mountaineer is think¬
ing even when he keeps silent, and I
know what's on his mind even when
he talks about something else.
This is the sort of culture your poets
should have given you. It is the cul¬
ture of nine-tenths of the earth, but
no one has yet managed to put it down
in words or pictures or films.
Be a bit humble, at least. Your cul¬
ture has gaps as wide as ours. Per¬
haps even wider. Certainly more
damaging to a teacher in the elemen¬
tary schools.
Philosophy. Any philosopher studied
out of a handbook becomes a bore.
There are too many philosophers and
they say too many things.
My philosophy teacher never took
a stand for or against any of them.
I could not work out whether he liked
them all or simply didn't care.
If I have to choose between two
teachers, one a nut on the subject and
the other totally indifferent, I'll take
the nut the one who has a theory of
his own, or prefers a particular phil¬
osopher. He is certain to talk only
about that philosopher and to attack all
the others, but he would make us read
the original writings of that philoso¬
pher during all of our three years of
school. We would come out knowing
that philosophy can fill an entire life.
Pedagogy. The way pedagogy is
taught today, I would skip it altogether
although I'm not quite sure. Perhaps
if we go deeper into it, we could de¬
cide whether or not it has something
to say.
We might discover that it says one
thing, and one thing only. That each
boy is different, each historical
moment is different, and so is every

WHERE LESSONS ARE OPTIONAL
A school completely different from Barbiana in its approach to
teaching yet which like Barbiana is a clean break with traditional
methods is Summerhill School, north-east of London, founded
50 years ago by A.S. Nell!. Pupils are free to attend class or
not as they please. "A school that makes active children sit at
desks studying mostly useless subjects is a bad school" says
Neill. "It is a good school only... for those uncreative citizens
who want docile, uncreative children who will fit into a civili¬
zation whose standard of success is money." Summerhill has
pupils aged from 5 to 15, including youngsters who are unable to
adjust to traditional schooling. "There is a lot of learning in
Summerhill," says its director. "Perhaps a group of our 12-year-
olds could not compete with a class of equal age in handwriting,
or spelling or fractions, but in an examination requiring originality,
our lot would beat the others hollow." A.S. Neill (above with
some of his pupils) has written several books about his school,
the latest entitled "Summerhlll" (Penguin, London, 1971). Photos
on this page are by the English photographer John Walmsley
and are published in his pictorial study "Neill and Summerhlll:
A Man and his Work" (Penguin Education Special, 1968).

AN EQUAL CHANCE FOR ALL?
In most countries, it Is now recognized that a new type of education is needed at all levels
to bridge the gap between the cultural life of disadvantaged areas and that of the school, and
to give all children an equal chance for a proper education. Certain lucky children, coming
from upper Income families or families with a good cultural background, get off to a high-
powered start (photo above), while millions of less fortunate children never get started at all
on the road to education (top photo) or if they do start, find themselves on an un-merry-go-
round and never complete even the first cycle of schooling (photo far right). One of the most
challenging educational problems of our time is how to make education directly relevant to the
lives and Interests of children, to arouse their Interest and enthusiasm (photo top right) through
direct experience and participation learning (photo right).

### 52140: Stark profile of wastage in education

STARK PROFILE
OF WASTAGE IN EDUCATION
In order to get a picture of school drop-outs and repeaters in the world, Unesco undertook,
in 1969, a world-wide inquiry on this subject, carried out by its Office of Statistics. Spe¬
cial questionnaires were sent to 148 countries. The difficulties of this kind of global
research in education are shown by the fact that only 58 of the countries were able to
provide data complete enough for analysis. The results have been published in a detailed
report, "The Statistical Measurement of Educational Wastage", presented to the Inter¬
national Conference on Education, in Geneva, in 1970. Below Gabriel Cárceles Breis, of
Unesco's Office of Statistics, presents a brief analysis of these findings. Data in his ar¬
ticle relating to social disparities and access to education are taken from "Group Dispa¬
rities in Educational Participation and Achievement ", a 1970 report by the Organiza¬
tion for Economic Co-operation and Development (O.E.C.D.) in Paris. A special Unesco
report on this subject, "The Social Background of Students and their Chance of Success
at School", was the main item of discussion at last year's International Conference on
Education, in Geneva (see page 4). The Unesco report points out that "because of varia¬
tions in educational systems and still more so because of differences in the way occupa¬
tions and social groups are defined for national purposes... statistics on this question
need to be used cautiously, and inter-country comparisons are to be avoided."

enormous efforts by educational
authorities in most countries of the world, access to basic
education is still far from universal in the developing
countries.
PRIMARY SCHOOLS
In 1967-68, nearly 70 per cent of children of primary school
age were enrolled in schools throughout the world. But
whereas in the industrially developed countries enrolment
reached nearly 100 per cent (North America 98 per cent,
Europe and the U.S.S.R. 97 per cent, Oceania 95 per cent),
in the developing countries it was much lower (70 per cent
in Latin America, 55 per cent in Asia and 40 per cent
in Africa).
Even more significant is the breakdown of the figures
of children who were not enrolled. Thus, taking the 6 to 12
age group during 1967-68 in various parts of Africa, we
find that 9 out of 10 children in Mauritania and 8 out of
10 in Mali and Chad were not enrolled, whereas in Algeria
and Botswana the proportion was only 5 out of 10 and
in Zambia 4 out of 10.
These figures refer to children enrolled, not to those
who attend school regularly. In some areas in the develop¬
ing countries, there is seen to be a big difference between
the number of children enrolled and the number actually
in class. Children very often drop out during the school
year to help their families, particularly with the crops
at harvest time.
In Latin America, 4 out of 10 children were not enrolled
in Salvador and Nicaragua, 3 out of 10 in Colombia,
the Dominican Republic and Peru, 2 out of 10 in Chile
and Mexico and 1 out of 10 in Argentina.
Figures available for Asia show that 9 out of 10 children
were not enrolled in Saudi Arabia, 5 out of 10 in Iran,
3 out of 10 in Thailand and Syria, whereas in Singapore
the figure was only 1 in 10 and in Japan 1 in 20.
SECONDARY SCHOOLS
The proportion of children of secondary school age
enrolled at all levels in 1967-68 throughout the world
was 40 per cent. The gap between the developed and
the developing countries was thus even greater than
for primary education. In North America 92 per cent of
secondary school age children were, enrolled, followed
by the U.S.S.R. and Europe with 65 per cent and Oceania
with 60 per cent. Then came Latin America with 35 per
cent, Asia with 30 per cent and Africa with 15 per cent.
REPEATERS
A very large number of children "fail to make progress
in school and sometimes spend several years in one
class repeating the work that they did in previous years.
These repeaters occupy places in schools and block
entry for others coming along behind them.
In 1967-68, the first grade of primary school was repeated
by 1 out of 2 children in Chad, Togo and Gabon, by 1 out

at least half the pupils enrolled in the above countries

repeated.
In Latin America the number of repeaters is generally
lower but even so 1 out of 3 children repeat the first year

portions in view of the relatively few children enrolled
in the first place.
In some countries drop-outs from primary education
amount to over 80 per cent of those who enrol. In a
country in which only 10 per cent of children between
the ages of 6 and 12 have been enrolled In school, it
means that only 2 per cent of children who should normally
have access to education pursue their studies to the
end of the primary school programme.
In Africa, of 100 pupils enrolled in 1960 in the. People's
Republic of the Congo, Dahomey, Gabon and Libya, 50 had
dropped out of school before the end of the primary cycle.
In Algeria, Burundi and Upper Volta, drop-outs numbered
60 out of 100, over 70 in Botswana, the Central African
Republic and Madagascar, and over 80 In Rwanda and
Chad.
During the same period in Latin America, 50 per cent
of children enrolled dropped out in Salvador and Panama,
over 60 per cent in Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay and
Venezuela, and over 70 per cent in Colombia and
Guatemala.
In Asia, over 50 out of 100 school-children dropped out
in India and Quatar and over 60 out of 100 in the Khmer
Republic.
URBAN AND RURAL AREAS
The proportion of drop-outs in rural areas is much higher
than in urban zones. The following examples taken from
four Latin American countries for which comparative
statistics are available give a clear idea of the situation:
Percentage of drop-outs
Total Urban zones Rural areas
Colombia 72.7 52.7 96.3
Dominican Republic 69.6 48.1 86.1
Guatemala 74.7 50.4 96.5
Panama 37.7 19.3 54.7
It is clear that in predominantly farming communities the
chances of completing primary school are very small. As
a result, agricultural modernization is hindered and
migration to the towns may increase.
SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DISPARITIES
Few studies have been made concerning social and
economic disparities in access to and participation and
success in secondary schools In the developing countries.
A study made by the Organization for Economic Co¬
operation and Development, in Paris (Background Study
No. 4, "Group Disparities in Educational Participation",
1970), shows, however, that In industrially developed
countries, a form of social selection appears to take place
during the transition from primary to secondary education
and, more noticeably, from secondary to higher education.
ACCESS TO SECONDARY EDUCATION
In the Netherlands, for example, the ratio of grammar
school admissions to 12-year-olds was found to vary
considerably among social classes. In 1960, 67 per cent
of upper stratum boys, 25 per cent of middle stratum
boys and 7 per cent of lower stratum boys were admitted.
The figures for girls were comparable but somewhat lower
at 63, 19 and 4 per cent respectively. Similar trends
were noted for England and Wales.
In France in 1963, 55 per cent of children who had
completed their primary schooling were admitted to
secondary education, as compared with only 30 per cent
in 1953. But the gap among social groups was still

quite substantial: 32 per cent of agricultural workers'
children (13 per cent in 1953), 45 per cent of workers'
children (21 per cent In 1953) and 94 per cent of children
of higher level employees and members of the liberal
professions (87 per cent in 1953) who had completed
primary schooling were admitted to secondary education.
Furthermore, dropping out from secondary education
was much more marked among children from the under¬
privileged classes. In 1963-64 in France, workers' children
represented 24 per cent of the school population at the
beginning of the secondary cycle, but only 12 per cent
at the end.
ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION
The same O.E.C.D. study shows a very wide disparity
in the social and economic background of students accord¬
ing to the country considered. A clearer idea of the pro¬
portion of students of working class origin entering higher
education is given by the graph on this page. But it should
be remembered that the definition of what constitutes
"the working class" may vary from country to country.
The table below shows the problem in another way.
Lower Stratum Upper Stratum
France 1964-65 27.1 629.0
Japan 1961 32.0 565.0
Netherlands 1961-62 10.6 359.0
Portugal 1963-64 5.3 440.0
Spain 1962-63 3.9 151.0
Yugoslavia 1960-61 66.0 465.0
It compares the number of students per 1,000 active
males in the 45-54 age group (in other words, the students'
fathers' generation) in the different social and economic
groups in six countries.
Further striking evidence of disparity becomes apparent
when the statistical chances of young persons from
different social backgrounds entering higher education are
compared. This can be done by comparing the ratios of
upper stratum and lower stratum students with the active
labour force, using the latter as a standard.
The O.E.C.D. study shows that lower stratum youths
In Yugoslavia (in 1965-66) had 1 chance of entering higher
education against 4 for those from the upper stratum: in
the United States (in 1958) the ratio was 1 to 5, in Norway
(in 1964-65) the ratio was 1 to 7. At the other extreme,
the ratio was 1 to 65 in Luxembourg (in 1964-65), 1 to 87
in Spain (in 1962-63), and 1 to 129 in Portugal (in 1963-64).
See table on page 22.
The report concludes that social differences In edu¬
cational participation are widespread. In the O.E.C.D.
countries at least, "the chances of being in school are
distinctly superior for those with higher social origins,
somewhat advantageous for those with 'middle class'
backgrounds, and inferior for those from the lower strata
or with agricultural backgrounds. Only the magnitude of
the difference varies among countries."
In short, says the report, social group differences in
educational participation appear to be a persistent
characteristic of educational structures in all O.E.C.D.
countries, and any change that is taking place is gradual
in the. extreme. m

Do-it-yourself
schools
in the Philippines
by Pedro T. Orata
I HERE is a saying that if
Mohammed cannot go to the moun¬
tain, the mountain must go to Moham¬
med. This principle has been applied
in the Philippines during recent years
to help make education at all levels
available as quickly as possible es¬
pecially to children living in the most
remote villages, and at little or no extra
cost to the government. The aim has
been to provide children with the
kind and quality of education which
they can afford and which is most
relevant to their needs.
These self-help Innovations com¬
prise barrio (village) high schools, pre-
schools, community colleges, and mul-
tigrade schools, on the one hand, and
on the other, science teaching and
social studies for better living, teach¬
ing learners to think, to weigh values,
to work and to earn money to pay their
tuition fees and other school expen¬
ses, and training educational leaders
to do action research.
The projects were started in 1945,
immediately after World War II, with
the establishment of the first high
school outside a provincial capital, at
Urdanata, Pangasinan, in a roofless
church and without books, pencils or
paper, or money to pay teachers'
salaries.
The aim was to give every boy and
girl a chance to go to school by bring¬
ing the school to within walking or
commuting d'stance of their homes,
and to help them and their parents

PEDRO T. ORATA is the founder of the barrio
(village) education movement in the Philip¬
pines which he describes In this article. He
received the Magsaysay Award this year for
his 26 years of public service as an educa¬
tional Innovator. (These awards, made by
the Ramon Magsaysay Foundation in the Phi¬
lippines, and often called the "Nobel Prizes
of Asia", are given to Asian leaders In rec¬
ognition of public service.) Dr. Orata was a
member of Unesco's Department of Educa¬
tion from 1950 to 'I960, and Is now an honor¬
ary special assistant to the Secretary of
Education of the Philippines. He has written
extensively on the problems of education in
the developing countries.
(as part of their education for daily
life) to earn more by improving the
productivity of their farms or plots of
land and through the acquisition of
new skills to enable them to help
support their own schools.
We started from where the people
were, with what they had, with exist¬
ing school facilities, equipment and
personnel, and proceeded one step
forward or even half a step at a
time, the people themselves (children
and adults) helping to make the deci¬
sions, formulate the plans, carry them
out and assess their performance, on
the basis of which they helped revise
the programme.
If we had waited until all was well
provided buildings, textbooks, scien¬
ce equipment, well qualified teachers,
etc. the 250,000 children and young
people who are now enrolled in some
1,500 barrio high schools, 45 commu¬
nity colleges and 500 pre-schools
would still be waiting for a chance to
go to school.
We began with a survey of the
situation in order to find out what was
good about it; what, in fact, should
and could be continued and extended?
We did not start by asking for addi¬
tional funds, equipment and personnel,
but did what we could to make better
use of what was available. In some
cases, we had nothing with which to
begin but the will to do what we believ¬
ed needed to be done, and so we
went ahead the best we could.
The purpose of this positive ap¬
proach was to avoid the all too com¬
mon practice in the Philippines, and
perhaps elsewhere as well, of starting
with a recital of a long list of prob¬
lems and difficulties, after which every¬
body is discouraged and no one dares
make a start.
The way we did it, the people were
generally encouraged to go ahead
further after learning that they had
done many things that were worthwhile
and good. This approach may have its
limitations, but it has also its advan¬
tages. People are encouraged to go
on and they feel better able to do so
than if they start with a feeling of frus¬
tration and despair.
We looked at each situation to find
out what knowhow (local and foreign),
facilities, and resources were available
with a view to using them to the full
as a means partial or total of put¬
ting up additional classes, or under¬
taking experiments, or improvising
needed equipment, conducting semi¬
nars and workshops, and so on.
Where rooms were used only for
five or six hours a day, it was possible,
by rearranging the schedule of
classes, to add one or two high
school, pre-school, or community col¬
lege classes, which were scheduled
to meet when the rooms were free.
The home economics cottage, the
shop and garden tools and equipment,
the school garden itself, could be
used when not needed by the regular
classes, which occupied them for only'
part of the school day.
I N the Philippines there are
many qualified teachers who are un¬
employed. We used them to teach
the additional classes. There are also
many teachers who are qualified, or
who "an qualify with little additional
training, to teach these classes, for
which they receive a modest fee to
supplement their small regular salary.
So we gave them the extra job, which
required one or two additional hours a
day, and which they invariably wel¬
comed.
Existing elementary or high school
libraries were used for the time being,
with a supplement of books.
In schools, in hospitals, in chemists'
shops, and in the homes of students
there are innumerable objects that are
discarded and thrown away: burned-
out electric bulbs, empty cans and
bottles, worn-out tyres and inner-
tubes, broken glasses, corn husks,
bamboo and wood. These were u§ed
to improvise science equipment for

a.
The Philippines has been making an enormous effort to expand education in recent years. In seeking to give more
children access to schools, Philippine educators have come up against two major problems: low family income
(annual average $150 per person) in a country that is rich in natural resources but insufficiently Industrialized; and
the large number of isolated communities In this mountainous archipelago which comprises 11 big islands and 7,000
small ones. Eight million children and teenagers are still unable to attend school regularly, according to an official
of the Philippines Department of Education. This situation applies as much to rural schools (above a village hidden
away in the tropical forest of northern Luzon) as to those in small towns such as Dagupan, north of Manila where
horse-drawn cabs (below) are a familiar part of the street scene.

high school and college classes and
play equipment for pre-school children.
The principal of the school or the
district supervisor served, with token
payment, as assistant principal or offl-
cer-in-charge of the high school, pre¬
school or college, to administer the
additional classes. This resulted in a
process of inter-relation (at no extra
expense) between the elementary and
even high school and college, which
is one of the most pressing aims of
school administrators everywhere, in
the Philippines and in other countries.
Equally important was to make use
of other countries' experience in deal¬
ing with similar problems. What have
educators done in Switzerland, in
Israel, and in Singapore to deal with
the language problem? What has been
done and Is being done, and with
what success, in Burma, in Thailand,
in Fiji, in India, in Australia to relate
the content of instruction at the
various levels to the problems and
needs of the people, especially in the
villages?
Foreign experience was not copied,
but adapted to problems as they
arose. Unless this is done, what is
likely to happen and Is happening in
some places now is for a country to
repeat the mistakes made elsewhere
instead of learning from such mis¬
takes.
What about teachers' salaries, text¬
books, library books, and other essen¬
tials? Again, we looked around to see
how private schools and colleges,
starting from scratch, have been able
to establish, operate, and maintain
their institutions with substantial profit
to themselves. If they were able to
do so, why with all the facilities
already available could not the new
classes be operated on a non-profit
basis?
Before a high school class is opened
in a barrio (village) elementary school
this applies also to pre-school
and community college classes the
parents and would-be students sign
an agreement that they will, by work¬
ing more to earn extra income, sup¬
port the barrio high school, community
college or pre-school classes, pay the
teachers' salaries, buy the textbooks
or pay the rentals on them, purchase
additional library books or equipment
(that cannot be improvised), etc.
The students and their parents are
assisted in their effort to earn more
by raising the productivity of their
plots of land and farms or to start a
new business or project to earn extra
cash. This is not extra-curricular, but
is made part of the school curriculum
to prepare the students for life and
self-employment, and to give their
parents, who may be awarded a certi¬
ficate of proficiency In recognition of
their newly acquired competence, use¬
ful continuing education. The students
are given high school or college credit
for doing these things to help them¬
selves and each other.
The extension workers of the Bureau
of Plant Industry, the Bureau of Ani¬
mal Industry, PACD (Presidential
Assistance for Community Develop¬
ment), NACIDA (National Cottage
Industries Development Administra¬
tion), and other government entities
are consulted and asked for help
so' that students and their parents will
acquire the new skills' and aptitudes
that they need. Invariably the help is
given gladly and free of charge.
If, for example, a student is given
a piglet to take care of and later on
to sell at a profit, out of which he pays
his tuition fees and other expenses, he
is guided in the work, as part of his
education. He is shown how to take
care of the piglet, how to raise its
food, what to do if it becomes ill, how
to have it injected to prevent it
becoming ill, and after he sells the pig,
to return the initial amount used to
buy the piglet, with the legal interest
of 6 per cent lo the revolving fund or
to the person who bought it for him.
We have been fortunate, from the
beginning and as we went along, to
get a little help from outside, including
foreign agencies the Barrio Book
Foundation, the Asia Foundation,- UNI¬
CEF, Unesco (through its Gift Coupon
scheme), PACD, and others in the
form of limited funds with which to
purchase textbooks to be resold at
low cost to the barrio high schools
and community colleges, to improvise
science and play equipment; to prov¬
ide teaching guides, etc.
IN this way, it has been
possible within the last seven years to
enrol, at little or no additional govern¬
ment expense, more than a quarter of
a million children and youths in barrio
high schools, community colleges, and
pre-schools. These projects were
started In 1964, 1966 and 1969, res¬
pectively.
This year we expect to open "multi-
grade schools" (schools with first to
sixth grade classes under one teacher)
for the most remote villages of the
Philippines. If fully implemented, this
project will benefit over a million young
people who either do not go to school
at all or remain in school for a very
short time.

### 52249: Do-it-yourself schools in the Philippines

'BARRIO' SCHOOLS
Since 1945, schools at every level In the
Philippines have mushroomed thanks to a
nationwide campaign based on ingenuity
and imagination. Undaunted by lack of
ideally suitable buildings and specialized
teaching material, educators and teachers
have helped communities in all parts of the
country to set up classrooms that are used
in rotation throughout the day for primary,
secondary and higher education. The
network today comprises 1,500 barrio
(village) schools attended by 160,000 pupils,
one-third of whom are teenagers. Far
left, nursery school children stage an
impromptu show. Left, primary schoolgirl
plays with a piglet, contributed by the
local community fund. In school she learns
how to rear the piglet, the sale of which
will pay for the school materials she needs
for one year. Right, a village home
economics classroom for intermediate grade
girls. "Multigrade" schools, with first to
sixth grade classes under one teacher, are
now being opened to bring education to
a million more youngsters.
This should not be taken to mean
that money as much of it as may be
available is not necessary. Of
course it is, and the more the better.
But money is not all that is required.
Imaginative, selfless, and dedicated
leadership is necessary to do better
what is being done with existing
resources, facilities, equipment and
personnel.
Furthermore, the extra money that
is needed may be raised and contrib¬
uted by the people themselves as part
of their continuing education for life.
And if by any chance the Govern¬
ment has money to spare, it may be
used to provide revolving funds to
establish work projects for the stu¬
dents and their parents.
Many so-called innovations are very
expensive, and what is more, after the
equipment is installed, it is often not
used because nobody has been train¬
ed to operate and repair it if it should
get out of order. In education, every
effort should be made to encourage
innovations that are not expensive,
which the country can afford. It is
better if some of the machines or
equipment that may be needed can be
Improvised. We did this, first In scien¬
ce and then in the social studies, In
pre-school, in practical arts, In home
economics, etc.
In improvising such equipment, the
children not infrequently did some of
the work at home where, invariably,
the parents and other children took
part to their own benefit. Indeed,
some of the equipment, such as lamps,
weighing devices, etc., are useful in
the home. Very often, housewives
are cheated in the market where
weighing machines and measuring
sticks are tampered with.
We started by doing things that
were possible with existing facilities
and personnel, after which there was
ample time to do the other things that
required more money, time and effort.
We found that the best preparation for
the more elaborate operations is suc¬
cess in undertaking simpler projects
requiring little or no extra funds or
training abroad. Once simple pro¬
jects have been undertaken suc¬
cessfully, the more difficult ones are
more easily handled than would at first
have seemed possible.
WiHAT about improving the
relevance and quality of education?
We have not gone far on this either,
but we have taken a few steps forward.
We extended the teaching of scien¬
ce beyond the learning or memorizing
of scientific facts and discovering
principles by the so-called "process"
or "discovery approach". We asked
the question: "After the discovery of
a scientific principle, what follows?"
We went two steps further; first, we
made an effort to lead the pupils to
apply the principle in very simple and
practical ways to select seeds for
planting or to lay out a bamboo irri¬
gation scheme from an artesian well;
and second, we guided them to share
what they knew and the benefit of what
they did to apply scientific principles,
with their classmates and neighbours.
We guided science students to
improvise scientific equipment, to save
money, which was not available, and
more importantly, to make science
learning more meaningful and interest¬
ing, as well as useful, to them. This
is not without precedent. In Switzer¬
land, to give one example, watch-mak¬
ing students devote the first year of
a four-year course to making the
tools with which to construct a watch
as part of their "on the job" training.
The social studies courses were
designed to prevent students from ever
becoming criminals or victims of crime.
They not only learned what was good,
but they practised doing it as well.
Furthermore, they shared their know¬
ledge with their classmates and
neighbours.
We tried to teach them from the
first grade or even pre-school to
think, to weigh values, and to act
accordingly. We made use of real
life situations In the classroom and in
the community, on the bus or the side¬
walk, etc., and we used-the situations
abundantly described in all the text¬
books to stimulate them to think and
to act accordingly.
We still have far to go. But we feel
that selfless, dedicated, and imagin¬
ative leadership is needed as much
or, in many cases, more than money.
If money was available, well and good,
but we did not wait until we got it.
If we had, we would still be waiting.
As it happened, when the govern¬
ment saw the good that resulted from
our efforts, it offered to provide
funds. And, paradoxically enough,
there is now an effort to make high
school education free. This would be
a mistake, first because the govern¬
ment cannot afford it; and second,
because it would result in the students
and their parents being deprived of
the means of working harder to help
themselves, as part of their education
and preparation for life and self-
employment.
To sum up, we undertook the many
projects which we thought were
needed, without funds, by the simple
expedient of helping the children and
their parents to help themselves In
opening and supporting their own
schools and colleges, by improving the
productivity of their plots and farms
by the use of better methods and
more effective skills. This is a very t\"l
important part of their "education for £f
life," and why not as part of their
preparation for higher studies, as
well?

### 52253: A UNESCO youth forum on democratization of education

by
Thierry
Lemaresquier
A Unesco youth forum
on democratization
of education
RANK face-to-face discussions between teachers and schoolchildren,
education administrators and students have long been a familiar feature of
school and university life. But until the International Conference on Education
organized by Unesco in Geneva, in September 1971, no International conference
had ever provided a forum for a dialogue between students and those responsible
for national education policies.
The Geneva Youth Forum brought together conference delegates from some
hundred countries and schoolchildren and students of different nationalities. Its
aim was to bring the dialogue "into the public arena" through a confrontation of
views on the major theme of the Conference the effect of students' social
background on their chances of success in school.
Although the views of educational
planners and administrators often co¬
incide with those of school-children
and students as regards the facts of
today's educational problems, there
are numerous points of disagreement
as to the basic causes and to the
remedies proposed by one side or the
other.
Opening the debate, the students
declared that making education more
democratic means not only providing
more education for more people, but
also giving more persons a say in how
it should be run. "Traditional educa¬
tion cannot be adapted to the needs
of increasing numbers of people,"
they affirmed; "it must be remade."
But who is to remake it? Not only
education officials and administrators,
but the people as a whole. Only they
know what their needs and aspirations
are. The question of "democratizing"
education should be discussed at
every level of the population. Let the
process of making education more
democratic begin with a truly demo¬
cratic act, said the students: the
participation of the greatest number
in the remoulding of education.
From this standpoint, the problem
of education and in particular its
democratization is Inseparable from
the national and international social

1968 to 1971 he was president of the Inter¬
national Student Movement for the United
Nations, and has been a U.N. consultant on
youth participation In development.
and political context. Conference
delegates and students agreed that
one cannot hope to make radical
changes in a country's social structure
through education while continuing to
regard education as an isolated
instrument for development.
The aims of education are not ends
in themselves but the means through
which all peoples can fulfil their
highest aspirations. Children should
study in order to develop their minds
rather than to pass examinations and
collect diplomas, said a background
paper prepared by the students, which
quoted the words of the French writer
Paul Valéry : "Diplomas are the worst
enemy of culture."
Education should not be a "funnel".
It should be an instrument that reveals
the need for changes as these arise:
it would be absurd to develop educa¬
tion while maintaining a social structure
that is almost universally unjust.
Teaching, said the students' paper,
should seek to promote a worker's
personal and social development and
not simply his productivity.
The students also criticized the
reasoning that problems of democratiz¬
ing education should be approached
in one way in industrially developed
countries and quite differently in
developing countries. The idea is a
fallacious one that too often serves to
screen the real problems.
Indeed, while it is not easy
to establish the exact relationship
between a country's economic develop¬
ment and the increase in the number
of young people entering school, it is
more and more difficult to see a direct
link between the kinds of education
now being exported from the Industria¬
lized countries to the developing coun¬
tries and the real needs of the peoples
concerned.
Some students said frankly that
while the democratization of education
gives the mass of the people a fuller
awareness of their situation and
Droblems, it is quite clear that with
few exceptions education in the
developing countries has been made
only superficially democratic. Accord¬
ing to one student, most attempts by
young people to press for reforms in
the developing countries inevitably
lead to the exclusion of these students
from the educational system.
Quite often the very idea of school
is alien to the cultural environment in
which students live. Thus the pro¬
cess of making education more
democratic is bound to spark off
conflicts over values between parents
and children, city-dwellers and rural'
communities, the wealthy and the
under-privileged. Education and edu¬
cational institutions patterned after
those of industrialized countries
become instruments of social segrega¬
tion instead of a means to mobilize
national effort based on the goals and
aspirations of the developing peoples.
ROGRAMMES for making
education more democratic affirm that
each person has an equal chance of
success, but in reality lead to greater
inequality, since an educational system
open to all inevitably reflects the
existing social structure. In other
words, education has given rise to
aspirations based not on the real needs
of its "consumers", but on the objec¬
tives of educational administrators.
Students taking part in the forum
felt that the problem of equal chances
in school could not be dealt with
rationally without first examining the
question of pre-school education.
Research has shown the importance

## [Page 29](078383engo.pdf#page=29) 0

### 52253: A UNESCO youth forum on democratization of education

of parental influence at this stage of
childhood when receptivity is at its
greatest. During his pre-school years,
a child gradually acquires a rich
intellectual, cultural, social and emo¬
tional heritage which will largely
determine his behaviour during his en¬
tire life. ,
Among other factors, growth dis¬
orders due to undernourishment or
malnutrition are often a cause of failure
in school. Students stressed the
importance of nutrition and especially
the need to ensure a balanced protein-
rich diet for under-privileged children.
The students were opposed to the
principle of competition which they
saw as the pivot of most educational
systems. "The school must redefine
its purpose and the content of educa¬
tion, and bring about a transition from
competition to solidarity," they declar¬
ed in their background paper for the
Unesco Geneva Forum.
This applies particularly in trade
and technical education which is often
regarded as being reserved for the
"half-failures", and which always
recruits its students from the poorer
sections of the population. While
stressing the need for this type of
education in the developing countries,
the students found it regrettable that
leaders in these countries are too
often inclined to accept the myth of
the "humanities" and Western schol¬
astic tradition, thereby tending to
lower the standing of manual work In
the eyes of their own citizens.
This theme, which many analysts
have developed in the past, is part
of a broader criticism of education
for its failure to open up sufficiently
to the outside world and its scorn of
the information and knowledge that the
communications media can bring to
young people.
Studies have been made of the
proportion of information school-age
children receive from school as
compared with that reaching them
through press, radio, television and
other mass media. They show that in
a highly-industrialized society, some

the cruel environment with varying
success.
Like all other small peoples, the
Arctic nationalities found themselves
in a paradoxical situation at the turn
of the century. They had become
objects of keen interest, and their
customs were studied by scientific
societies, scholars and even laymen
interested in the exotic, yet there were
few who seriously worried about their
future, about the fact that these ancient
peoples, with their patriarchal way of
life now being drawn into the world
economy, were totally unprepared for
it and helpless.
Not assimilation, but extinction
threatened them. The Yukagirs who
once had been numerous and about
whom ancient legends told that the
glow of their many campfires had put
the Aurora Borealis in the shade, were
dying out by 1917 there were just 300
of them left.

munity, cruel exploitation and plunder

Schools
governments had by the turn of the
century ruined many of the small
northern peoples physically and spiri¬
tually.
Roald Amundsen, the great Nor¬
wegian explorer, who knew these
people well, said in one of his books:
"The best I can wish our friends, the
Netchili Eskimos, is that "civilization"
should bypass them."
At the beginning of this century the
small Arctic peoples still lived under
the tribal system, and ¡n some places
they continue to do so. In the 1920s,
when the first Russian teachers came
to the Siberian taiga and tundra, the
local nomadic tribes had never heard
of schools.
There were no words for "school"
and "learn" in the northern languages.
In the Chukcha language, for example,
the word "to discover" was used for
"learn", the word "to look at speck¬
les" for "read". The people there did
not think education necessary.
Another formidable obstacle to
schooling was that the languages of
the small nationalities were primitive

in many respects and that most of
the Arctic peoples had no written
language.
Their word stock was rich as regards
terms to describe their natural envi¬
ronment and their occupations; at the
same time, however, there were few
words to describe less habitual con¬
cepts. There were no words for the
various mineral resources, for crops
and implements used in agriculture, no
words to express abstract concepts.
An interesting example of the in¬
ability to draw generalizations is given
in the reminiscences of Pyotr Skorik,
a Russian teacher, who came to far¬
away Wellen, on Dezhnev Cape, some
60 miles from Alaska in 1928:
"I remember a lesson in arithmetic
I had prepared using local examples.
'One hunter,' I told them, "killed five
seals, another killed three. How many
did they kill altogether?'
"Suddenly questions were being
fired at me from- all sides.
'When did they kill the seals?'
'Yesterday,' I replied without think¬
ing.
"Yesterday nobody went hunting, the
weather was bad." .
'Who killed the five seals?'
'Lenle,' I gave the first name that
came to my mind.
"There was an uproar of contagious
laughter, and 1 involuntarily joined in.
Lenle was probably the most un¬
successful of all the hunters in the
camp."
Geographic isolation was another
aggravating factor. The northern peo¬
ples generally lived in small groups,
dozens or even hundreds of kilometres
apart; they often migrated from place
to place in pursuit of animals and in
search of better pastures for their
herds.
It was therefore extremely difficult
to establish equal educational oppor¬
tunities in practice (formally they had
been proclaimed by the Constitution
of the Russian Federation in 1918) in
the extreme north where nature was
so uncharitable that even some ani¬
mals were unable to subsist.
A Committee for Assistance to the
Peoples of the Northern Borderlands
was set up In 1920. It played an impor¬
tant role in advancing the economy
and culture of the small northern
peoples. In the early 1930s national
areas were formed throughout the
Siberian tundra and taiga in order to
enlist the participation of the local
population in matters of state admin¬
istration. Thus, the approach to the
development of education in the
northern' areas was of necessity a com¬
prehensive one palliatives, half-heart¬
ed measures could not resolve the
problem.
The idea underlying that approach
was to preserve national traditions, to
develop and enrich them. Letters of
recommendation were given to young
people sent from the Far North to
schools in central Russia. The follow¬
ing letter was issued In August 1926
to Tevlianto, a Chukcha from Anadyr,
who later became the first represen¬
tative of the Chukcha people to the
Soviet Parliament:
"At the proposal of the Kamchatka
Regional Revolutionary Committee the

cha from Anadyr, has been sent for
schooling to Soviet Russia.
"Tevlianto has spent all his life in
the inhospitable, severe tundra, in
conditions found only in the Polar
North. The land he visits does not
resemble Anadyr at all. The Revolu¬
tionary Committee is afraid that he,
not knowing the Russian language and
local customs, may encounter diffi¬
culties he will be unable to cope with.
Besides his specific psychological
make-up, his vulnerability, excessive
impressionability and so on, may
aggravate matters.
"We ask those to whom he may
apply to give Tevlianto every possible
help. He deserves it, for even though
he does not know how to read and
write, he is one of the most gifted
and inquisitive young Chukchas in the
whole area. There is much in Tev¬
lianto a Russian school can bring to
the surface, and which will help him
to advance his people."
In the 1920s the Institute of the
Peoples of the North in Leningrad
became the main teaching centre.- The
first 19 students (of 11 different
northern nationalities) enrolled in 1925.
By 1930 it had a student body of 195
(including fifty girls). Naturally, the
students were drawing government
grants.
With the help of their Russian col¬
leagues the first students of the North
worked out alphabets for their lan¬
guages to enable them to write in the
vernacular.
aF^T the end of the 1920s and
in the early 1930s, so-called cultural
bases were set up throughout the
Soviet Far North. They did much to
transform the economy and change
the way of life of the people there.
Each cultural base had a boarding-
school, factory, hospital, bakery, repair
shops for the fishing fleet, mobile
medical and veterinary teams.
These "bases" became the meeting
ground between the old and the new,
between age-old traditions and the
material, social and spiritual innova¬
tions introduced by the new life. In
these cultural centres the local people
learned about modern life. They saw
unusual things and heard new ideas,
and their children were taught to read
and write.
I was one of them. When I was a
little boy and left my yaranga to go
to school in the morning it was as
though I made a journey with a time
machine into the remote future.
In the evening when I returned it
took me back thousands of years. I
would sit on a sealskin with my books
doing my homework, while my relatives
next to me perused a piece of fur sub¬
merged In a pot filled with sea water
to divine the currents in the bay, to
predict the approach of seals to the
shallows, and many other things. They
muttered their invocations and their
voices blended with mine as I was
learning a poem by heart. Putting my
copybook aside for a minute, I had
to bow my head to my elders to have
my forehead rubbed with sacrificial
blood...
In 1930 universal, compulsory, pri¬
mary education was introduced into the
national areas and districts of the
North. The "migratory schools" for the
children of nomad reindeer breeders
provided many thousands with primary
education. The number of schools
grew from 123 in 1930 to over 500
in 1936.
Early in the 1940s an almost com¬
plete set of textbooks In the verna¬
cular of the various Arctic peoples was
published for the first and second
school years, and some textbooks for
the third and fourth, and also some
suggested teaching methods as well
as children's literature for extra-mural
reading. At the same time some
60 titles of books on different subjects
appeared in the vernacular.
At present all the basic types of
schools provided for by the Soviet edu¬
cational system primary (eight-year)
and secondary (ten-year) schools
operate in all the national areas and
districts of the Soviet extreme north.
The conditions in the North make
for the spread of boarding and day¬
care schools. In the 1967-68 academic
year there were 523 schools in the
northern national areas, with a pupil
population of 90,000 (including 23,000
children of the "small nationalities").
There are also over 100 children's
music schools, 21 children's artistic
schools, 34 specialized secondary
schools (general, musical, theatrical
and choreographic) in the Soviet north.
It should also be pointed out that
the peoples of the north do not
have to spend a single penny on the
education of their children. The state
takes care of them from the day of
their birth. Creches are open to them
at state expense; after that they go on
to kindergartens and boarding schools,
where they are fed, clothed and pro¬
vided with textbooks; during vacations
they travel free of charge to their
parents' domicile and back again.
The programme of secondary schools
in the extreme north is the same as
that for schools in any other part of
the Soviet Union. In the initial stages
at primary school they are taught in
the vernacular, so that the Chukcha,
Eskimo, Nenets, Mansi and other
children will be able to read and
write in their own language. In the
final stages of their primary education
they learn the Russian language in
parallel with their own.
This basic knowledge in his own
language helps the pupil to master the
three R's and, hence, also spoken and
written Russian, which he needs for
his secondary education, for the sys¬
tematic study of the rudiments of the
sciences. The Russian language is
particularly important for the northern
peoples since it unlocks to them the
door to culture and knowledge.
I know that from personal exper¬
ience. Acquaintance with the best
works of Russian literature did us a
world of good. In those days we
considered even the books by foreign
authors as part of Russian culture, for
they came down to us through the
Russian language.
The Russian language greatly in¬
fluenced the languages of the Soviet
"small nationalities". They kept their
figurative speech, their phonetic
system and their basic word stock,
but it was filled with a new content.
1 HE modern development of
the North has created the need for
people with varied specialities execu¬
tives, mining engineers, physicians
and the young people there are now
being trained for the many professions
needed by their rapidly growing eco¬
nomy.
The government helps the northern
peoples in many ways and in parti¬
cular by giving them top priority in
admission to all educational estab¬
lishments in the U.S.S.R. So it is
hardly surprising that they number a
high percentage of persons with a
specialized education.
But the conditions responsible for
the former economic and cultural
underdevelopment of the northern
peoples (primitive economy, geogra¬
phic isolation and so on) are found
not only in the ice-bound Arctic but
also In the world's jungle and desert
areas. So in helping to pass on the,
educational experience of the Arctic,
Unesco will also aid peoples in many
other parts of the world.

Half a page from the textbook is all
that is needed to explain this; the rest
we can tear up and throw away.
History. There are several different
history surveys. I would like to get
the figures on those most in use.
In general they are not history at all.
They are narrow-minded, one-sided
little tales passed down to the peas¬
ants by the conqueror. The sufferings
and struggles of the workers are either
ignored or stuck into a corner.
In the best, most "modern" book,
Gandhi is disposed of in nine lines.
Civics. Civics is another subject that
I know something about, but it does
not come up In your schools.
Some teachers say, as an excuse,
that It Is taught by implication through
other subjects. If this were true, it
would be too good to believe. If that
really is such a great way to teach
something, then why don't they use it
for all subjects, building a sound
structure in which all the elements are
blended together and yet can be ex¬
tracted separately at any time?
Admit that in truth you have hardly
any knowledge of civics. You have
only a vague notion of what a mayor
really is. You have never had dinner
in the home of a worker. You don't
know the terms of the pending issue
on public transport. You only know
that the traffic jams are upsetting your
private life.
You have never studied these prob¬
lems, because they scare you. As
it also scares you to plunge into the
deeper meanings of geography. Your
textbook covers all the world but
never mentions hunger, monopolies,
political systems or racialism.
Tests in the classroom. While giving
a test you used to walk up and down
between the rows of desks and see
me in trouble and making mistakes,
but you never said a word.
I have the same situation at home.
No one to turn to for help for miles
around. No books. No telephone.
Now here I am in "school". I came
from far away to be taught. Here I
don't have to deal with my mother,
who promised to be quiet and then
interrupted me a hundred times. My
sister's little boy is not here to ask
me for help with his homework. Here
I have silence and good light and a
desk all to myself.
And over there, a few steps away,
you stand. You know all of these
things. You are paid to help me.
Instead, you waste your time keep¬

80 per cent of all information obtained
by children aged between 12 and 15
comes from outside school, and,
moreover, that 80 per cent of the
information imparted by schools is
largely irrelevant.
Many students criticized schools for
basing learning on essentially abstract
data which could often equally well
be acquired out of school, instead of
providing an education that links
training to the practical needs of
everyday life.
Since the school is part of a back¬
ward system which can almost never
avoid reproducing a given social
structure in a caricatural form, the
question of education, they felt, might
well be posed outside the school
framework.
"Education," they declared, "should
no longer be confined to a particular
age group, but should last for a life¬
time, constantly opening up new paths
before men and women and, even more
important, offering fresh chances to
all. With education as an uninterrupt¬
ed process, notions of failure and
success will lose much of their present
meaning. Those who fail at a parti¬
cular age or at a particular task will
have other chances. They will no
longer be condemned throughout life
to the consequences of their failure."
The purpose of lifelong education,
said the students, is to enable each
person to master the rapid changes of
modern life, though it is by no means
certain that all those responsible for
drawing up educational policies
accept this idea. The principle of
lifelong education could even be
surreptitiously transformed so as to
become an instrument of lifelong
indoctrination. History, unfortunately,
offers plenty of examples for those
who might find such a prospect
tempting.
The problem of social background
raises fundamental issues concerning
the role of the entire community in the
definition and running of education.
It is wrong for parents to relinquish
their role in favour of a teacher caste
made all-powerful as- education be¬
comes more and more institutionalized.
Nor is it normal for the teacher to be
relieved of his original task and to
become merely an overseer enjoying
an immunity conferred on him by the
school's monopoly.
The school itself should not abdicate
its social role within the community.
Founded to meet the needs of the
community, which daily become more
complex, the school has grown Into a
monopolistic system whose rigidly
structured principles are an obstacle
to any realistic social action.
To bring about radical changes In
the school, the students propose that
it should "adapt its action to the dev¬
elopment rate of each child; take the
child's personal motivation as its start¬
ing point, without however excluding
personal effort; reject all trends and
constraints that run counter to these
objectives; enable each child con¬
sciously to choose his future instead
of forcing him blindly to adapt to
existing conditions; let him learn by
personal observation, reflection and
experiment; develop joint research
activities; introduce a method of work
that allows for the expansion and
deepening of knowledge already
acquired."
The .community parents, children
and teachers should work together to
break down the barrier between the
school and everyday life. This nat¬
urally implies that the purpose of
democratizing education is to decen¬
tralize rather than to standardize, that
the development of personality should
become at least as Important an ob¬
jective as striving for "productivity",
and that educational change should be
part of an overall process leading to a
democratic society.
If, as is said, the educational budget
in many countries has reached its ceil¬
ing in relation to national economic
resources, it is surely disquieting to
find in the same overall national bud¬
get evidence of completely contradic¬
tory policies and expenditure.
How can a developing country con¬
ceivably go on spending more of Its
resources on arms than on education?
How can budgets for peace and bud¬
gets for war continue to expand side
by side? And is it reasonable for
some of the fruits of education to be
destroyed because resources needed
for a country's equipment are being
spent on defence material imported
from wealthy countries?
In a broader context, is the goal of
education to give a country's working
population better training so that it
may serve the interests of other
countries more efficiently? Should not
Its real aim be, to use the words of the
students, at the Geneva Forum, "the
emergence of a society in which each
person will be capable. of taking his
destiny and his future in his own
hands?"

How many
will get
to the top
Equal chances for all in school is a goal
still to be reached by all countries. In many
developing nations only 40 per cent of the
children of primary school age attend class,
and in some of these countries the figure is
much much lower. In the industrially
developed countries there is an alarming
rise in failure, repetition and early drop¬
outs from school. How far social and
economic factors, family background and
similar questions affect the current
educational malaise is today a problem of
growing international concern.
