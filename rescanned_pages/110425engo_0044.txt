Towns originally offered people
a place of refuge, of mutual help
and culture. According to nine-
teenth-centnry town-planning the-
orists, they should supply all human
needs. They were supposed to be
the very stuff of civilization. That
was not to be, and therefore when-
ever the authorities throw in their
hands, dismayed by the scale of the
problems and lacking the political
will, money or resources to cope with
them, personal initiatives are those
most likely to succeed. ||

The “Piraja Memorial Project” is a scheme run by the Centro de Edu-
cago Ambiental Sao Bartolomeu, anenvironmental education centre in
Salvador, Bahia State, Brazil. Its main aims are the affirmation of cul-
tural identity and citizenship, and the protection of the environment. The
Piraja Metropolitan Park, created north-east of Salvador in 1978, is a
1,550-hectare forest reserve surrounded by overcrowded shantytowns
where living conditions are appalling. Malnutrition and cholera are rife,
infant mortality is high. Young people are exposed to violence, racism and
drugs. Many drop out of school.

The park is of great historical and eultural importance, since it was
at Piraja that a famous battle for Brazil’s independence took place. It
was also here that the Jesuits built their first Indian village and that
quilombos (places where runaway slaves gathered) were later set up. It
is now under violent assault from several quarters: the extremely varied
wildlife is being savagely hunted down, the plant life devastated and the
rivers polluted by refuse, and forest fires are frequent. Black people’s
contribution to Brazilian history and culture—Salvador being the city
with the largest black population outside of Africa—is being ignored,
and places where the rites of candomble, the Afro-Brazilian religion, were
celebrated are being destroyed. The park’s living heritage seemed to be
sinking into oblivion,

In 1991, the Project selected a number of local young people, aged 14
to 18, to work as guides, make contact with other young people and act
as outreacl agents in schools and in the community at large. Twenty-six
teachers and 700 students were then recruited to replant and restore
the candomble sites. A library was opened in 1995 and an environmental
education programme was started, offering stndents a chance to take
part in practical activities, including school vegetable gardens. Seeing
the good work that was being done, UNESCO decided to make Piraja Park
an experimental zone of the Mata Atlantica Biosphere Reserve,

In 1996, the Project published a newspaper, put on a play, set up craft
workshops for children, spread its activities to other schools, mobilized
public opinion, and asked artists to act as “militants” in the cause of the
park. So many initiatives have been launched that they cannot all be listed
here. Work is now proceeding on the establishment of an open-air museum
to draw attention to the region’s history and eulture, and the local pop-
ulation is being encouraged to learn more about nature and respect it.
These activities form part of a wider socio-economic development strat-
egy lor the region, one of the poorest in the world. The United Nations
Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and several non-govermnental organizations
are already participating, and help of any kind for this fine project
would be welcome. |
