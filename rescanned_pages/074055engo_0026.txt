UNESCO FELLOWS mmm

REPORT PROGRESS

Y NESCO fellow D. D. Xo-
sambi, from India, stud-
ying in the field of

mathematical computing ma-
chines in the United States,
writes: «] have had a long
gession with Professor Eins-
tein, at his request, on certain
ideas of mine which parallel
his own on the possible exten-
sion of the theory of relati-
vity. »

Professor F. L. Polak (Ne-
therlands), on completing his
Unesco fellowship in Science
and Social Development sta-
tes: «It think I have made
considerable progress through
a critical study of American
theoretical and applied social
science. | intend to summarize
these results next month in
my inaugural addresg as pro-
fessor of sociology at the Rot-
terdam School of Economics,
of which I will send you «a
printed copy ».

«Norwegian Film Director
Nils Muller, Unesco-British
Film fellow, reports: « The six
months I spent in the British
Film Studios were most pro-
fitable to me. My studio
observation work led me on
to scores of ideas to introduce
in the Norwegian film pro-
duction. Before 1 went to Lon.
don, I hadn’t been directing
any film for 18 months, owing
to the crisis in production. On
my arrival back, I immedia-
tely started directing a feature
film, and I'm now completing
two short films. Later this year,
I will direct three short films
about the history of the town
of Oslo. I feel much more sure
of myself in my work since I
came back from London; I
kncw much more about film-
making than I did before I left
Oslo, and I hope that Him
production in Norway will
bring possibilities for me to
make use of all the things I
learned in the British Film
Studios. »

Text-book writer Herminia
Ancheta (Philippines), eva-
luating her Unesco fellowship
experience. concludes: « Pro-
gress in culture and education
is most effectively accomplis-
hed by an interchange of
ideas. The spirit of friendship
born of mutual collaboration
and understanding bring about
enduring world peace. All
these. I believe, are some of
the essential intangible values
of a Unesco fellowship. »

NOT ONLY
FOR HIMSELF

THESE are parts of a story

wich is being unfolded in
international cultural relations
— the story of the Unesco
fellow, a senior person who
resumes his studies in his
particular field of competence,
which is important and
necessary to hig country. The
absence of any direct personal
motive is the hallmark of the
Unesco fellow, of his pro-
gramme of study, observation.
visits, contacts and achiev-
ment : a Unesco fellow
studies not only for himself but
for his country.

During the three years of its
existence, Unesco has been
concerned with the administra-
tion of 262 fellowships alloca-
ted to 31 Member States. The
planning and administration
of these fellowships affect and
assist the component parts of
Unesco’s Exchange of Persons
programme — the collection
and dissemination of informa-
tion on all types of internatio-
nal study opportunities, and
the promotional and advisory
services to government and
accredited agencies on their
cultural exchange programmes.

Unesco fellowships aim at
pin-pointing and implementing
Unesco’s on-going programme

26

in education, science and cul-
ture in its Member States
through the fellowships media.
Unesco fellowships are there-
fore offered to mature persons,
in established positions, who
can contribute to the recons-
truction and development of
the scientific, cultural «and
educational life of their coun-
try on their retum from their
period of study abroad. These
principles apply both to
Unesco - financed and to
Unesco-sponsored fellowships,
the latter being fellowships
financed by government and
accredited agencies, under the
auspices of Unesco. Unesco’s
fellowship programme, which
was initiated as part of Unes-
co’s assistance to war-devast-
ated Member States. is now
extended to aid under-deve-
lopd areas, including trust ter-
ritories.

FOUR MAJOR
SCHEMES

kia, Denmark. Greece, Hun

Norway, the Philippines and
Poland), and concentrated on
six of the specific fields that
fall within the broad areas of
education, science and culture
with which Unesco is concer-
ned, nemely : Science and So-

Unesco fellows are now in
various stages of movement:
today some fellows are apply-
ing to their governments for
passports and to foreign con-
sulates for visas: others are
boarding planes and trains on

their way to the country of

study: atill others are wor-
king in a research laboratory.
in film studios, in newspaper
offices, or are undertaking a
tour of obgervation, while
others are returning Lome,
sometimes stopping at Uneaco
House to discuss their expe-
rience and draw programmes
for future action. Unesco re-
ceives valuable reports from
fellows on their studies and
observations, and programme
experts keep in touch with
them on a variety of problems
in the .’nesco programme,

A Unesco fellowship con-
fers upon the Unesco {fellow
permanent advantages, It
places at his disposal national
and intemational cultural re-
sources and gives him an
opportunity to establish con-
tacts in many countries. Thus
Unesco {fellowships create «a
network of skilled men of good
will in many countries, who
can assist in the promotion of
the ideals of knowledge and
international understanding for
which Unesco stands.

The experience of the
past two and a half
years has proved the
value of Unesco fellow-
ship grants not only as
a means of promoting
cultural understanding
but as one way of
making the various
programmes of Unesco
more tangible and
concrete.
