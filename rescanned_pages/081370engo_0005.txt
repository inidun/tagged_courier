cutive Board.

N three weeks time over 1000 men
I and women — delegates, official
observers, members of Unesco’s
Secretariat and journalists — will be
gathered in Florence, Italy, for the
opening of the Fifth Session of
Unesco’s General Conference.

Meeting from May 22 to June 17 at
plenary sessions in the renaissance
setting of the Palazzo Vecchio and at
committee gatherings in the 15th
century Pitti Palace, delegates will
consider how Unesco can best carry
out its work as the world organiz-
ation for education, science and
culture.

One question standing out abqve
all others in the minds of the dele-
gates will be that posed by Unesco’s
Executive Board at a recent meeting:
what action can Unesco take, apart
from that already proposed in its
1951 programme resolutions, to con-
tribute vigorously, in the present as
well as in the future, to the United
Nations Mission of peace.

This question was raised at the
Executive Board meeting by M.
Jaime Torres Bodet, Unesco’s Direc-
tor-General. “There are turning
points in the lives of institutions just

“IT REMAINS TO DETERMINE THE COURSE OF OUR
ACTIVITY IN RELATION TO PEACE THE SUPREME
OBJECTIVE AND MAIN JUSTIFICATION OF UNESCO."

as there are in those of individuals”,
he said. “I believe that the next
session of the General Conference
will represent such a turning point
for Unesco, at once for reasons con-
nected with the internal structure of
the Organization and for reasons
external to it. .

7“ Peace Today Or
A Future Peace?

<C HE difficulties and the dangers
T cvershadowing the world have

become so pressing”, M. Torres
Bodet pointed out, “that it is now
essential for Unesco to shoulder the
responsibilities imposed upon it by its
Constitution, as a part of the machi-
nery of the United Nations and Spe-
cialized Agencies, in the promotion of
peace.

“What exactly are those responsibi-
litiesT How can we carry them out?
And with what peace are we CCGncern-
ed — peace today or peace for a more
or less distant future? These supre-
mely important questions cannot be
evaded”, said the Director-General.

“Impelled alike by thie process of ils
own development and the condition of
the world, Unesco can and must sub-
ject its methods and aims to a thor-
ough and critical examination. I am

convinced that the fundamental object
of the next session of the General Con-
ference should ve to carry out such
an examination”, he added.

To carry out its tasks Unesco follows
a programme planned at three levels:
“information and exchange of docu-
mentation and news; research, in-
vestigation and enquiry aimed at
helping men and women to contribute

~~ actively to mankind's progress; and
"action, either by Unesco directly, or at

its instigation, to assist all countries
to contribute, through culture, educ-
ation and science, to peace.

As there are some tasks which
Unesco cannot undertake immediately
because of lack of funds, but which it
cannot renounce, a Basic Programme,
covering a number of years, has been
prepared and this, together with a
detailed annual programme outlining
the part that can be carried cut in
each financial year, will be presented
to the Florence Conference.

Programme activities proposed for
1951 require a budget of $ 8,150,000 —
an increase of $ 150,000 over the 1950
budget.

How close a co-operation between
Unesco’s Member States and its Secre-
tariat is required to carry out such a
pregramme was recently emphasised
by M. Torres Bodet. “Only through
the will and acts of Member States
can Unesco fulfil its true purpose —

While in Rome, Unesco’s Direc-
tor-General was received in au-
dience by Pope Pious XII.

Addressing the recently formed
Italian National Commission for
Unesco, in the impressive setting
of the Palazzio de Venezia, M. Tor-
res Bodet told its members that
Unesco had a major part to play in
every prcblem of our age.

Dante’s Noble Words

6“ ‘UR cause is that of every man
on earth,” he said. “And
that cause was described more

than six centuries ago by one of
your own outstanding thinkers in
ringing words as fresh and true
today as when they were first
uttered :

“There is one activity proper to
the human race as a whole which
is the destiny of all men however
many they may be, but to which
no single man, family, village, city
or nation can attain alone. The
nature of that activity becomes
clear when we consider the quality
most characteristic of humanity,
namely the power of knowing, the
intelligence.

ITALY, HOST TO UNESCO'S
CONFERENCE, WELCOMES
M. TORRES BODET

TALY, where preparations are being completed
for the opening of the Fifth Session of Unesco’s
General Conference in Florence, on May 22nd,
gave a warm welcome to M. Jaime Torres Bodet,

during his short visit

On his arrival in Rome, M. Torres Bodet was re-
ceived by H.E. Signor de Gasperi, the Prime Minister;
H.E. Count Sforza, Minister for Foreign Affairs, and
H.E. Signor Gonelwa, Minister for Education.

cerning the Florence Conference with the authorities.
On Monday, April 17th. he held a press conference
at which he described the aims and activities of

“As such a power cannot attain
its full stature in any single man
¢r group, it is necessary that the
human species should consist of
many units. Given, then, that
humanity is designed by nature to
develop the total power of the in-
tellect... a first requirement is that
mankind should live in the tran-
auillity eof true peace that it may
the more freely and easily devote
itself to its appointed work. The
conclusien is that universal peace
is the greatest of all the good
things which make up our felicity.”

“Never”, said M. Torres Bodet,
“has the connection between peace
and culture of the mind been
stressed more strongly than in
Dante Alighieri’s noble words. And
so we find that in the very dawn
of Italian poetry and political
thought, Unesco’s path is mapped.

Greatest History Lesson

this aspect of the problems
of today, “he continued” we

sheuld, however, add that, though

peace is necessary for the de-
velopment of the mind, a huma-
nistic training of the mind is today

just as necessary for the strength-
ening of international peace.

“If peace is necessary for cul-
ture, culture is also necessary for
peace - and that, gentlemen, is the
greatest lesson that history should
teach us and it is also the ideal
of Unesco.”

After leaving Rome, the Direc-
ter-General travelled to Florence
where he was able to inspect the
section of the Pitti Palace to be
used by Unesco’'s Secretariat dur-
ing the Conference, and the mag-
nificent hall of the Pallazo Vec-
chiog, in which the plenary sessions
will be held.

At Milan, which he visited be-
fore returning to Paris, M. Torres
Bodet was the guest of honour at
a reception given by Count Stefano
Jacini, a member of Unesco’s Exe-
cutive Board and leader of the Ita-
lian delegation to the last two
Sessions of the General Conference.
Throughout his Italian journey,
M. Torres Bodet was acCompanied
by H.E. Signor Mameli, Director-
General of Cultural Affairs at the
Italian Foreign Office, and by
Signor Alberto de Clementi, Italian
delegate to Unesco.

as a network of mutual services, the
value of which is self evident, as a
collective force working for the trans-
formation of the world,” he stated.
“The Secretariat, no matter how zet-
lous, cannot make up for any apathy
on the part of Member States, for it
can do no more than serve their will
— the motive power for all its work.”
Proposals to definé clearly both the
tasks cf the Secretariat and those of
Member States and a recomendation
that the latter should provide their
Unesco National Commissions with
adequate permanent secretariats will
be submitted to the Conference. Other
resolutions call on Member States to
ce-cperate wth one another in joint
acticn for Unesco aims, and suggest
that greater use be mdde of inter-
national conventions involving the use
of education, science and culture for
progressive and peaceful ends.

Creative Genius Of
Florentine Masters

0-OPERATION will also be the keynote

of a series of special meetings

held in connection wth the Con-
ference. One of these will group
representatives from National Com-
missions for Unesco and the second,
representatives from the 100 non-
governmental crganizations having
consultative status with the Organiz-
ation. .

Unesco’s present mempership —
55 nations — is likely to be increased
during the Conference, following its
consideration of membership applic-
ations from Korea the United States
of Indonesia and the Hashemite
Kingdom of Jordan,

Meeting in surroundings which pro-
claim the creative genius of the Flo-
rentine masters, delegates will study
Unesco’s plan for the preparation of
a scientific and cultural history of
mankind. And, it is fitting that in
the city of men like Leonardo da
Vinci, Michelangelo, Botticelli, Mas-
saccic and Donatello, they should be
called on to consider ways of
improving the material and moral
freedcm of creative artists.

Ameng the other impertant ques-
tions on the Conference agenda are
whether final steps should be taken
for the preparation of a Universal
Cenvention on Copyright, en the pos-
s'bility cf founding an international
institute of the press, on the work
already done fowards evolving a uni-
form Braille script for the blind and
cn Unesco’s part in the United Nations
Technical Assistance Programme.

During the Conference, the Italian
Government will sponsor a large-scale
programme of cultural events in Flo-
rence, including exhibit'ons and lec-
tures. The Florence Festival of Music
and Opera, which co-incides with
Unesco's Conference is to include a
Theatre Festival, from May 25th to
June 13th, at which Italian, British
and French companies will perform,
