UNESCO'S PROGRAMME FOR 1951

mental organizations on the granting
‘and administering of international

study grants, and making this infor-.

mation available to individuals, groups
and governments, UNESCO will also
help to bring about adoption of com-
mon metheds and techniques in the
‘administration of schclarships and
the planning of new programmes.

As budgetary limitations prevent
UNESCO from allocating large sums
for the creation and administration of
scholarships, the programme for 1951
aims to encourage exchanges of per-
sons by co-ordinating activities of or-
ganizations which award fellowships
and study grants.

Help to intellectual refugees is cov-
ered by an International Student Ser-
vice proposal sponsored by the Ne-
therlands Conference delegation, pro-
viding for the creation—with UNESCO
help—of a fund for the use of refugee
students.

UNESCO will itself during 1951

grant 55 fellowships for citizens of its
Member States. These will allow spe-
cialists to study activities related to
the UNESCO Programme. After the
beneficiaries have finished their work
and returned to their heme countries,
UNESCO remains in close contact with
them so that the knowledge they have
acquired may be used in the applica-
tion of UNESCO's programme.

of the main Unesco tasks for 1951.

The aim will be to present these
activities so as to focus them upon the
Universal Declaration of Human
Rights and within this framework, to
highlight the right to education, the
benefits of scientific progress and in-
formation. Emphasis will be put on
material illustrating: Fundamental
education for all people and education
for international understanding; the
right of all peoples to enjoy the bene-
fits of scientific progress and the rela-
ticnship of the work cof scientists to
peace and human welfare; the strug-
gle to resolve racial and other pro-
blems, and the methods and achieve-
ments oi international co-operation ;
the part played by creative artists in
such co-operation; freedom of infor-
mation and the free exchange of ideas.

The organization will examine the
possibility of creating an Internatio-
nal Institute of the Press and Infor-
mation through consultations with
national and international organiza-
tions.

The replies from these groups will
be discussed by an experts’ committee
set up by Unesco. On the basis of the
replies, Unesco will be able to decide
whether a conference to create the
Institute sheculd be called.

The General Conference also ap-
prcved a number of projects to help

* Unesco’s efforts to reduce obstacles to

the free flow of information. One of
them is to secure from the contracting
parties of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade further reductions
of customs barriers to the internatio-
nai circuiaticn of educational, scienti-
fic and cultural materials.

Unesco will also co-operate with the
Regional Economic Commissions of
the United Nations in the encourage-
ment of the domestic production, the
promotion of the exchange, and the
facilitation of trade agreements in-
volving educaticnal, scientific and cul-
tural materials. It will seek, in con-
junction with these commissions, spe-
cial dispensations for categories of
persons engaged in educational activi-

ties with regard to visa and frontier
formalities, labour permits and simi-
lar facilities. Unesco will work for
wider application of schemes initiated
by the Universal Postal Union to per-
mit payment in national currencies
for subscriptions to foreign newspa-
pers, and for a 50 per cent reduction
on postal charges for printed matter.

The preparation and dissemination
of a study such as “World Press Co-
verage of Educaiional, Scientific and
Cultural Information” will also be un-
dertaken.

An international agreement reduc-
ing cr abolishing economic controls on
the movement cof books, newspapers,
works of art, documentary films and a
wide range cf other educational mate-
rials, was adopted by the Conference *

During 1951, Unesco will also carry
out intensive work as a clearing
house for the collection, analysis, diss
emination and exchange of informa-
tion and experiences in the techniques,
uses and effects of the press, film, ra-
dio and allied media in the fields of
education, science and culture.

Expert aid missions will be underta-
ken to advise and assist in the im-
provement of mass communications in
under-developed or war devastated
countries.

The world survey of technical faci-
lities, already carried out in 52 coun-
tries or territories, will be completed
and extended to 33 other countries
and territories. The Member States
will be invited to set up within the
framework cf their National Commis-
sicns standing consultative commit-

tees on technical and professionnal -

problems.

Finally, Unesco will continue its ef-
fort to bring about world unification
in Braille. A world Braille Council
will be created and conferences will be
held for experts in Arabic and Spa-
nish-Portuguese Braille,

RELIEF SERVICES

HE Relief Assistance Service of
UNESCO, set up five years ago
as the Reconstruction Depart-

ment to help war-hit countries, has
now extended its programme to meet
the needs of any country requiring
relief.

‘War damage is being repaired, but
new emergency situations requiring
the assistance of ah international or-
ganization such as UNESCO stil] arise.
The wars in Palestine and Greece left
many refugees to be cared for as did
the earthquakes in Ecuador last year
and in Peru fhis year, when numerous
schools and buildings of great histo-
ric and artistic value were destroyed

The General Conference considered
two such problems in particular: the
situation of refugee children in Greece
and the Near East, which continues to
be extremely serious. As no really ef-
fective help could be given from
Unesco’s limited budget, the Confe-
rence decided to appeal to the govern-
ments of the 59 Member States to
contribute funds sufficient for effec-

tive action.

Unesco’s Relief Service will continue
to assemble information on the needs
of countries and use it to prepare for
the provision of direct assistance or
the organization of voluntary aid cam-
paigns. It will also allocate credits
from the Relief Fund to needy coun-
tries and will assist them to purchase
and transport equipment and help to
secure import and export licences and
customs exemptions.

As UNESCO's funds are insufficient
for this work, the Service will work
with Member States to focus public
cpinien and sympathy cn the needs of
devastated areas and organise cam-
paigns for voluntary assistance. Fi-
nally, it will aid co-ordination inter-
nationally—and, through National
Commissions, nationally—of the ef-
forts of the voluntary associations
participating in UNESCO's relief work.
