© THE REPORT

N the opening words of his Report, the Di-

I rector-General draws attention to the excep-
tional difficulties encountzred during the
period under review.

“By advancing its next Session to the ninth
month of the year”, he writes, “the General
Conference imposed on the Secretariat, and
indeed on the whole Organization, a particu-
larly exacting timetable. In order to allow
sufficient time for the documents to be comple-
ted and despatched to Member States, the
Committees of the Executive Board had before
them, in the second half of May, the various
questions to be submitted to the General Confe-

rence, and the draft Budget for 1950.

“This preparation for the following year
absorbed a considerable proportion of the time
and energy of the higher ranks of the Secretariat
at a moment when they should have len devo-
ting themselves wholly to the execution of the
Programme. The work was also undertaken
much too early for it to be based on adequate
experience derived from the carrying out of the
current programme.”

The change in the Director-Generalship, Dr.
Torres Bodet notes, could not fail to affect the

normal development of the Secretariat’s work,
in spite of his efforts to avoid any break in
continuity. It was to avoid excessive distur-
bance of the existing machinery, which would
have had disastrous consquences at a time when
work was so heavy, that he decided not to
embark this year on a radical revision of the
structure of the Secretariat.

Apart from the severe time limit imposed
upon it, the Organization found itself faced
early this year with an additional task of the
first importance which had not been contempla-
ted by the General Conference at its Third
Szssion. This was Unesco’s participation In
the Plan of Technical Assistance for economi-

cally under-developed countries which resulted
from the Economic and Social Council's Reso-
lution of March 4. The new proposal involved
not only the holding of an extraordinary session
of the Executive Board (March 24-25) but
also the despatch to Lake Success of two senior
officials — Dr. Be:zby, Assistant Director-
General in charge of Education, and M. Auger,
Head of the Natural Sciences Department —
who were absent from their normal duties for
six weeks. Meanwhile the Director-General,
with the help of a group of five members of the
Executive Board, began to lay the foundations
of Unesco’s contribution to the Plan.

“This question”, writes Dr. Torres Bodet,
“will, in fact, be one of those to which we
have had to pay most attention. It has
also materially altered the nature of the
Fourth Session of the General Conference,
which was to have been a “short business
session’ Discussion of the Technical
Assistance Plan has involved an extension
of the Session by three days, and decisions
on the subject will be of greatest impor-
tance in connexion not only with that ques-
tion itself but with the development of our
cooperation with the United Nations and
other Specialized Agencies’.

A Two-Year Programme

T was clear to the Director-General and to
| the Executive Board that a “short business
session’ of the General Conference could not
und:rtake any radical revision of the programme
adopted at Beirut, and the addition of Tech-
aical Assistance to the agenda of the Confe-
rence did not invalidate this conclusion. This
meant that the .scheme adopted at Beirut must
be regarded as a two-year programme — a
circumstance that offered a welcome opportunity
to bring about greater concentration in the work
of Unesco.

Accordingly, the Director-General selected
from the “very large and widely ranging” two-
years programme a number of permanent activi-
ties or fixed projects which would have a prior
claim this year. It was not intended to reduce
the programm: decided on by the General
Conference, but to establish an order of urgency
in the matter of its execution. The various
projects were therefore divided into three
classes :

- (1) Projects involving a special effort in
1949;
(2) Projects on which normal work should

be carried out in 1949;

(3) Projects whose execution could be de-
ferred until 1950.

In adopting “this classification the Director-
General had the following criteria in mind :

(a) Practical value as regards raising the
standard of living of the ordinary people;

(b) Likelihood of securing the corporation
of leading intellectuals and professional people

in the Secretariat's work;

(c) Likelihood of achieving tangible results
fairly quickly.

“Surprise may be expressed”, he writes,
“that these criteria do not include peace
or international understanding. It goes
without saying, however, that all Unesco’s
activities are directed towards peace and
international understanding. The ques-
tion to decide is what of project contri-
butes most to that end. It seems to me
that the best type is that which does some-
thing for man rather than merely discussing

“However much they may disagree on
other matters, all men agree that plenty is
preferable to famine, health to disease,
knowledge to ignorance, and communica-
tions and exchanges to isolation. They
