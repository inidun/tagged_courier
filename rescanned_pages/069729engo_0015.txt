In more than one sense the Chipayas -

were chullpa puchu—mummified re-
mains. I will not describe my journey
across the sand dunes, my slow pro-
gress over the desolate plains of the
Chipaya territory. The day I arrived
within sight of the village, the mirage,
frequent at that time of year, had en-
larged and multiplied the huts to a
point where I seemed to be approach-
ing a strange city beside a great
non-existent lake in which strange,
jagged mountain peaks were reflected.
~ The promise held out by this optical
illusion was nothing, however, com-
pared with the thrill I felt on being
surrounded by a group of Chipaya
women.

Imagine the stupefaction of an arch-
aeologist on finding himself confront-
ed by mummies who have "stripped
off their bandages and dressed them-
selves once more in the clothes of their
period. The women surrounding me
were dressed exactly like those who
had, four centuries earlier, crowded to
gaze at the conquistador Almagro when
he crossed these same deserts, and they
also resembled the dried-up bodies
found in burial caves.

I was particularly struck by one
detail—the tinkling of the little bronze
figures that dangled from the innume-
rable plaits in which these
women’s hair was arranged. (Cont’d on
I had seen these humble next page)
