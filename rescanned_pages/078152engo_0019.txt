For millions of the world’s citizens the resources of ideas, news and entertainment can be
tapped through the daily newspaper, a turn of the radio or TV dial, a visit to the neighbourhood
cinema. For millions more, however, these facilities are lacking and men are cheated of a
rich heritage. The maps on these pages focus attention on the fact that areas where literacy
is low correspond closely with those regions of the world where poverty of communication
facilities deprives people of the opportunity to be fully informed. The Universal Declaration
of Human Rights contains a clear statement of the right of the individual to receive informa-

facilities shall exist for receiving information. The Economic and Social Council of the United
Nations called on governments in 1954 to encourage the development of domestic informa-

Agencies and the U.N. itself to grant technical assistance for this purpose. In December 1954
Unesco's General Conference also authorized the provision of aid for developing commu-
nication services and set aside a substantial sum for sending expert missions at governments’
requests during 1955 and 1956. Unesco, as one of its primary obligations, is thus working
with the United Nations to help people everywhere to enjoy the right to information.
