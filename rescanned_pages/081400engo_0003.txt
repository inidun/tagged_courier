EXPERTS TO SEEK BEST ADULT EDUCATION METHODS

AT UNESCO SPONSORED MEMINAR

N a quiet ccuntry hotel cn the sheres of Lake
Mondsee in the Austrian Alps, educaticn specialists
from zcme twenty countries will meet this month
for a seminar cn adult education crganized by Unesco.

From June 18th to July 29th these educationists,
gathered at the Waldhotel, in Kreuzstein, about 25 miles
from Salzburg, will continue part of the work begun last
year at Elsinore, Denmark, by the first International
Conference on Adult Education to be held since the war.

Embracing every kind of study and every form of
technical and cultural knowledge, adult education has
become one of the most important modern problems, and an

one of the most universal.

INCE 1947, Unesco has

instituted a new kind of

conference — the Seminar.
The Seminar brings together
educators from a number of
countries to examine important
educational problems. These
educators make plans of action
applicable to their respective
countries and prepare in-
formation material which can
be used on a national or
international scale. The
Seminar, as well as being a
real international gathering, is

But it has an over-riding purpose — to defend the
cause of peace in men’s minds, to “awaken”, as M. Torres
Bodet, Unesco’s Director-General,

told the Elsinore

a means of education in in-
ternational understanding.

Conference, “in the conscience of every adult

an awareness both of his personal responsi.

bility and of his intellectual and moral fel-

lowship with the whole of mankind”.

It was with these words in mind that the
Elsinore Conference laid down two funda-
mental principles for adult education — unity
of aim and free choice of methods,
should lead, through education, to a type of
culture in which the motive principle is per-

sonal responsibility”.

“that means.

Apprenticeship and re-education

HE most effective ways of achieving this
T will be sought by the specialists meeting

at Kreuzstein, this month. They know
that in adult education the best results are
not realized through conventional educational
Adult education is to some extent
both a complementary and a compensatory
process ; it is partly an apprenticeship and

partly a work of re-education.

ADULT EDUCATION
IN AUSTRIA

FTER the disaster of

National Socialism and

war, adult education in

Austria has more to do
than merely to spread know-
ledge; it must demonstrate the
real values in democracy, hu-
man understanding, tolerance
and self-control.

This is not at all easy, as
the younger generation first
got to know these words
amidst misery, starvation and
political chaos. In any case,
it is not enough to approach
the intellects of the students,
but the whole human being
with mind and soul.

But there is another diffi-
culty. Austria is a country of
an old and most valuable cul-
ture. But many people, beset
by daily problems, find no
comfort in it. To many, cul-
ture appears to be a luxury,
useless for the “man in the
street”. So adult education
has to build new bridges be-
tween men and culture to
make them meet.

In Austria, adult education

tries to approach the whole
human being. For this reason,
the residential colleges have
arranged courses of four to
twelve weeks’ duration, in
which young farmers, farm-
workers, factory-workers and
clerks become g community of
their own. Plays, excursions,
dancing, singing, music, sport
are important parts of this
systam of education. The
teacher behaves as a friend,
the lectures are followed by
discussions.

Self Aetivity the Goal

MORE raticnalistic type is

that of the Folk High

Schools (Volkshoch-
schulen) and evening classes
in the towns. It is not easy
to get a holiday for purposes
of adult education; so many
pecple. busy all day long in
offices and factories, attend
evening courses and single lec-
tures in these institutions.

From thesz classes grow nu-
merous discussion groups and
study circles, for self activity
is a conscious goal. As far as
possible, all technical means,
such as cinema, phonographs
and projectors are used, but
these means are most limited.

Of special interest and im-
portance are the attempts
towards artistic education.
Here again, institutions of
adult education try to lead the
students to understand art by
self activity (singing groups,
sculpture workshops, handi-
craft clubs, etc.). Excursions
to museums and exhibitions;
good reproductions of works
of art in the rooms and corri-
dors contribute also to the
students’ interest.

Role of Libraries

IS the provinces, excursions
to Vienna or other towns,

to theatre concerts, exhi-
bitions are increasing in num-
ber. The Volkshochschule
Linz has initiated visits to
Italy and other neighbouring
countries, a most valuable re-

t

newal of an old educational
idea.

In the libraries, the leaders
advise the readers from a psy-
chological point of view to
bring the right book together
with the right person as far
as possible. This is made
more difficult by the limited
book supply in many libraries.

The librarians are partic-
ularly encouraged to increase
their usefulness by attending
special courses. Lectures are
given to enable readers to
meet the authors personally
and discussion groups meet
frequently.

In the last few years, many
new circulating libraries have
been founded: small chests for
fifty or #hundred books are
sent to remote places and ex-
changed from time to time
Small town libraries have a
similar exchange system.

Educators from about 20 countries will meet in this lakeside hotel at
Kreuzstein, in the Austrian Alps, from June 18th to July 29th, for Unesco’'s
Seminar on Adult Education.

The problem is not so much how to teach a given subject
or to impart a given technique but rather how to co-
operate in helping men and women to develop a wider
understanding and use of life.

The Kreuzstein Seminar will therefore be more than an
opportunity for the experts to compare methods and
exchange views; it will offer them a chance to give on-
the-spot demenstraticns of adult education methods.

At Kreuzstein, they will study the many adult education
methods used in different countries and their discussions will
be combined with practical demonstrations such as exhibitions
and film shows.

The experts will be divided into four study groups under the
Seminar leader, Dr. Sven Bjorklund, Dean and founder of
the Stockholm University for adult education, and world
famous authority on the subject.

Towards A Community Spirit

HE first group will study the ways in which adult educ-

ation is organized and administered according to local

and national needs. Through the exchange of ideas and
experiences their work should produce a useful guide to both
the organization of adult education programmes and enlisting
of support for them. ;

The second group will study the “intellectual and scientific
training” of adults through classes, lectures, study-circles, films
and radio. It will also examine questions of specialization in
subjects connected with the stuflent’s work and the popula-
rization of science.

“Social and economic training” will be the concern of the
third group, in which the experts will consider the best ways
cf developing among adults a community spirit and an inter-
naticnal cutlook.

The fourth group will deal with the arts, and with the pro-
blem of leisure-hours.

The four group leaders who have already been appointed,
are: M. Jean Le Veugle (France), Mr. S. Whitman (United
States), Mr. Alex Sim (Canada), and Sig. Joannes Carlo (Italy).

The seminar will consider the possibility of establishing an
international centre for adult education, which would not only.
serve to train educators, but would also bring them into touch
with statesmen, writers and trade-union leaders.

The results of the seminar will subsequently be published as
a brochure for the guidance of educators throughout the
world.

NEW HEAD FOR UNESCO'S
EDUCATION DEPARTMENT

r. LIONEL ELVIN, formerly Principal of Ruskin College.

Mr. Elvin started teaching English Literature at Cambridge
University in 1930, two vears after graduating from there
with a first class Honours Degree. During the war he served
in the British Air Ministry and the Ministry of Information
where he was in charge of the Labour and Industry Section,

In 1945 he resigned his Cambridge Fellowship to become
Principal of Ruskin College. Since then he has been a member
of the University Grants Committee, of the Secondary Schools
Examinations Council and in 1948 was appointed to the Central
Advisory Council on Education.

He is the author of several works, among

to serve the needs of the world community,
particularly for peace. There is no conflict
of between these two, though we have to find
a balance, and one that may vary from time
to time.

“While I regard the first function as es-

said, “because it involves a necessarily slow
process of collecting information and the
like, and the times are too urgend for that
alone. As H.G. Wells said nen contemplat-

between education and catastrophe” .”
