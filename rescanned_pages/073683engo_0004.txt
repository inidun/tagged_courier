OE OF the highlights of the
recent Mexico Conference
was the importance attached to
the réle of the National Commis-
sions. As Dr. Milton Eisefchower,
chairman of the commitlee
dealing with this question, de-
clared with vigour: “Unesco is @
people’s agency” or, better still,
a “people’s movement” In this
sense it is strictly dependent on
the effective support that the
peoples of its various Member
States can give il.

The Mexico Conference was
unanimous in urging that Na-
tional Commissions be rapidly
created in those States where
they do not as yet exist, and that
the greatest possible assistance be
given to National Commissions
already in existence, especially
through the publication of infor-
mation concerning the work and
achievements of Member States.

The Unesco Courier is therefore
presenting on this page, sum-
maries of a few of the many
reports submitted recently by the
National Commissions to Unesco
and the General Conference on
the , work of their
Co-operating Bodies.

We regret ,that space permits
the reporting only of a very small
number of these highly interesting
documents—all of which show
the live interest that the Govern-
ments and peoples are taking in
the work of this Organisation,

Several of these Commissions
have only recently begun to
function, Others have already
gained considerable experience in
positive action. However, the
speed of development and the in-
ternal organisation of each of the
National Commissions is a ques-
tion that depends in large mea-
sure on its cultural tradition. Na-
tional Commissions are in fact
only the reflection of the na-
tional heritage of the individual
country. :

For example, the Unesco Na-
tional Co-operating Body in the
United Kingdom, which has al-
ready achieved important resulls
in its work, is based on a con-
ception which distinguishes it
from all other now existing Com-
missions. No central National
Commission exists in Great Bri-
tain, but instead nine specialised,
independent bodies each dealing
with ome of Unesco’s prineipal
fields of inlerest. This system
reflects the spirit of indepenrence
and the decentralisation which is
at the base of all British cultural
life. It would be absurd, and
indeed harmful to seek to deny
this true diversity of cultural
tradition which is the solid core

Reconstruction

N THE occasion of the meeting

of the U.S. National Commis-
sion in Washington on February
16 the entire membership of that
body numbering approximately
100 was received at the White
House, by President Truman, and
later addressed by Mr George
Marshall, the Secretary of State.
These two functions served to
mark the important place which
had already been won for itself by
the U.S. National Commission

during a life of a little more than.

a year. The rapid growth of this
body in prestige and in influence
is the more striking by reason of
the faet that when it was created
the National Commission was a
complete novelty in American life,
for a body of this sort, within
which the U.S. government, and
private groups and individuals
interested in education, science
and culture could all work to-
gether, had never before existed.

In its official report to the
Mexico Conference, the United
States delegation observed:

“The National Commission for
Unesco is an innovation in Amer-
ican life. To have stimulated the
creation of the Commission may
be deemed the first significant
achievement of Unesco in its re-
Jations with the United States.”

Professional organisations in
education, science and culture are
widely represented in the Com-
mission, but representation is also
given to many other groups in-
terested in the objectives of
Unesco—such as women’s organi-
sations, youth organisations, la-
bour unions and religious groups.

A Secretariat for the Commis-
sion is furnished by the Devart-
ment of State; this is known as
the Unesco Relations Staff, and
the Director of. the Staff serves
as Executive Secretary of the Na-
tional Commission.

The National Commission

at Work

The National Commission, the
Chairman of which is Mr Milton
S. Eisenhower, has, since its insti-
tution, advised the Government
of the United States on the for-
mulation and development of the
Unesco Programme and on other
important matters concerning the
organisation—inecluding the com-
position of the delegation to the
annual meeting of the General
Conference.

In addition, the National Com-

mission has assumed, as a task

particularly its own, the duty of
promoting a greater understand-
ing of the general purposes of
- Unesco on the part of the people
of the United States, and, with
this aim in view, established a
Committee of Information.

“A further point to emphasize is, that if they are to fulfil
their function, National Commissions and Co-operating Bodies
must be provided with the secretariat, organisational and finan-
cial facilities required to exercize real activity.

“A final point is the part that the National Commissions can
play in the execution of Unesco’s programme, which is not a
series of operations centrally directed and executed by the Secre-
tariat in Paris, but a combined effort to which each country
can contribute. It will call for close and regular contact between
the Secretariat and the National Commissions.”

Febryary 19+8

1947, under the auspices of the National Commis-
in Philadelphia; it was attended by the re-
presentatives of more than {ive hundred national
voluntary organisations and served to dissem-
inate widely information concerning Unesco. At
the same time, to a certain extent, it was possible
to give advice to local communities as to ways In
in the carrying out

sion

which they might best help
of Unesco’s programme,

To follow up this meeting, to which delegates
had come from all over the United States, it was
decided to hold an experimental regional meeting

in Denver, Colorado from May
brought together approximately
1,900 persons from the Mountain-
Plains region of the United States,
representing organisations, colle-
ges, schools and civic grouns. The
Conference organised itself into
committees dealing with the

‘various subjects on Unesco’s pro-

gramme

Since then, amongst many local
meetings held, there are particu
larly worthy of note those held
at Milwaukee on April 30, and at
San Francisco on June 10. The
former was paid for by a local
department store, and brought
together one thousand represen-
tatives of various organisations,
while the latter was sponsored by
the San Francisco Museum of Art.

Educational Reconstruction

Participation by U.S. voluntary
organisations in Unesco’s pro-
gramme of educational, scientific

‘and cultural reconstruction is co-

ordinated by a body closely relat-
ed to the National Commission.
This is CIER (Commission for In-
ternational Educational Recon-
struction). Its functions are to
stimulate action by voluntary
organisations in the field of
educational reconstruction, to
make known needs in that field
and to serve as a clearing house
in the field.

American voluntary organisa-
tions during 1946 contributed
nearly $62,000,000 for educational
reconstruction, and more than
$42,000,000 during the first six
months of 1947. Of this amount
approximately 80 per cent was
contributed to Unesco countries.
Evidence of great growth of
interest on the part of the Amer-
ican public in the educational
reconstruction of war devastated
countries is provided by the fact
that more than 300 voluntary
organisations are now participat-
ing in this work, as against fewer
than 40 a year ago.

NE OF the first actions of the

new Austrian government
after liberation was the reconsti-
tution of the old National Com-
mittee of Intellectual Co-oper-
ation, marking the beginning of
a large scale effort to restore the
cultural relations of Austria with
foreign countries—relations which
had been completely broked du-
ring eight years of German occu-
pation and war.

Indeed, Unesco is pleased
that, in spite .of material and
technical difficulties, Austria has
taken the initiative to publish the
first German-language magazine
devoted exclusively to the acti-
vities and aims of the Organisa-
tion. This periodical, entitled
“Unesco-Bulletin”, produced its
first issue in January of this
year, less than a month after
Austria’s application for member-
ship in Unesco was accepted by
the General Conference in Mexico

City.
Under the auspices of the
National Committee a great

many societies have been formed
for the maintenance of cultural
relations with foreign countries.
Typical examples, selected from a
list of twenty such bodies, are
the Society for the Maintenance

of Cultural and Economic Rela-

tions with the U.S.S.R., a Franco-
Austrian Society, an  Austro-
British Society, an Austro-Amer-
ican Society, an Austro-Iranian
Cultural Federation and an
Austro-Argentine Society.
