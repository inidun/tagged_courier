OST-WAR Italy has shown an amazing spirit

of enterprise, as if a long pent-up vitality

had suddenly found release and come out
as naturally as the leaves on the trees unfolding,
after winter had ended, under the first warm rays
of the sun. Every man has gone his own way
and set about working out the solution of his
individual difficulties, but at the same time an
effort has been made to attack some deep-rooted
evils which are incompatible with today’s
atmosphere of freedom. One of these -efforts,
which has been carried out with scanty financial
support, but with genuine energy and devotion,
is the battle against illiteracy.

Illiteracy is a long-standing plague of Italian
society and varies greatly from one end of the
peninsula to the other. In the last century,
when Italy was in the process of achieving
national unity, illiterates made up the majority
of the population. The Government hastened to
install compulsory elementary schools and within
a few decades the population of the urban and
industrial North was as literate as that of the
most advanced countries of Europe.

But for many reasons, progress in the South
was much less easy. The most recent nation-
wide statistics (1931) indicated 40 per cent of
illiteracy in Sicily, 46 per cent in Lucania and
48 per cent in Calabria. During the Fascist
regime the problem was passed over in silence and
appeared to have been forgotten. Then, with the
war, the destruction of roads and school buildings,
the dispersion of families and the general poverty
and confusion, the problem became more difficult.
to solve than ever.

HIS complex phenomenon of large-scale
illiteracy is, of course, closely tied up with
the economic and social conditions of the

South. We may say, in a general way, that illite-
racy is born of poverty and breeds more poverty
in its turn; it arises where there is an absence of
democracy and tends to perpetuate this absence.
But if one of its causes is strictly economic, the
other has social, political and spiritual impli-
cations which are a concomitant of the structure

Italy

Only 6,000 people live

in Regiano Gravina
— but it is the most
active Calabrian vil-
lage in the fight against
illiteracy. In four years
the illiteracy rate fell
from 68 to 22 per cent,

of the state and the form of its culture. The two
causes are connected and, indeed, interdependent,
and for this reason no partial solution of the
problem can be achieved.

Anyone can see the relationship between
illiteracy and poverty. A map illustrative of its
distribution would show that it goes hand in hand
with barren land, bad sanitary conditions, mala-
ria, and the lack of industries, communications
and public works. Miserably poor families must
put their children to work early. They send the
boys to watch over herds of goats grazing on the
desolate clay, and put the girls to cooking,
cleaning, watching over the babies, weaving
baskets and carrying jars of water from the
distant well. The school is, in most cases, far

away ; there is not enough money to buy books
and notebooks, and frequent illness keeps the
children at home.

The townships and villages are as poor as the
families, and the central Government is distant.
Schoolhouses, like roads, sewers, heat and light,
are often lacking. When the winter wind blows
snow down from the mountains people become
isolated.

Under these conditions it is easy to appreciate
the difficulties of learning to read and write.
And, to the illiteracy of children, we must add
that of those adults who once had some schooling
but who, for lack of practice, have forgotten all
they ever knew. The hard life of the peasants
does not leave much time for that miracle of
communication, the written word. And it is
plain enough why poverty and illiteracy fall into
a vicious circle. The illiterate peasant is
hampered in any attempt to better his lot ; he
is condemned to stay on the land without any
possibility of migrating or raising his social
status. And so it is that he hands down the state
of servitude into which he was born.

ESIDES these causes of illiteracy, there is, to
my mind, another category of underlying
reasons which, paradoxically, make the

peasants’ ignorance an asset in their own eyes.
They live in an immobile and timeless world.
circumscribed by ancient rites and customs and
the tasks imposed by the changing seasons; yet,
a world that is rich in human values and a culture
all its own. There is a peasant way of life that is
radically different from our modern urban civi-
lization; a peasant art and a peasant philosophy
that have been handed down without benefit of
the written word in the heritage of legends, folk-
tales, popular dramas and songs, all of which
have inspired or enriched our more sophisticated
art forms.

The peasant, living alone on the land, is
content with this artistic and philosophic
tradition, with this poetry of proverbial wisdom
transcribed into doggerel verse. The observant
traveller cannot fail to be struck by the frequency
with which the peasants speak in rhyme and
make use in their dialect of highly poetic images
