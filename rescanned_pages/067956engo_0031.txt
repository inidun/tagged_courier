‘BRING ME TWO HORSES’,
HE WHISTLED

On La Gomera, one of the Canary Islands, a really first-class silbador
(whistler) can send a message that will be heard and understood five miles
away when conditions are good: (the record is said to be about nine miles).
He (or she, as in photo on opposite page) normally whistles with one or two
fingers or a bent knuckle in the mouth, immobilizing the front of the tongue.
Position of the fingers does not affect the sound of the whistled language,
whose articulation is provided by the tongue, as in ordinary speech. X-ray
photograph, above, illustrates this. Whistler depresses tip of tongue whose
back is raised for articulation of the vowel ‘‘u". To whistle the group of
sounds ,‘‘oto’’, (see pitch contours in graph, left) tongue starts from a low
position, rises to touch the palate for the ‘‘t"’ and finally goes back to the ‘‘o"
position. Below, electronic transcription of whistled sentence in Spanish
(given in phonetic spelling) whose meaning is ‘‘Bring me two horses".
