tiles treated with certain chemicals
under the influence of radiation may
help to produce new materials.

HM Chemical Compounds. Gamma rays
have been found to have a catalytic
effect on certain chemical processes
and have also helped to form new
chemical compounds (which would
not otherwise form under ordinary
conditions of chemical reactions). The
usefulness of this effect to the chemi-
cal industry is, therefore, invaluable.

MW Thickness and Density Gauges.
Radioactive sources emitting beta-
particles (electrons) are used as
thickness gauges to ensure uniform
density of products like paper. The
rollers are pre-set to pass through a
certain thickness of paper which is
rolled off the production line. The
electrons passing through the desired
thickness of paper are detected by a
counter which in turn controls the
setting of the rollers. As soon as
thicker paper passes over the rollers,
more electrons from the radioactive
source are stopped and there is less
detection by the counter which brings
the rollers closer till the pre-set value
is reached.

Thus, defects in thickness of
industrial products like paper, can be
detected and quality control exercised.
Similarly, density of packing of tobacco
in cigarettes is detectable with the
help of such gauges.

MW Carbon Dating. Old archeological
fossils and bones contain organic
matter and all organic matter contains
carbon. All natural carbon has a
very minute percentage of the radio-
active isotope carbon-14 which has a
half-life of about 5,700 years. Thus,
if archeological specimens containing
organic matter such as bones, etc. are
placed before highly sensitive elec-
tronic detectors, the faint emission of
radiations from radioactive carbon can
be registered and counted. As radio-
active carbon must have decayed over
the period of antiquity, the intensity of
emission can determine the age of the
carbon and thus “date” the archeolo-
gical specimen (see article page 22).

The scientist has learnt to tame the
atom in the service of man and his
quest to discover new horizons will
continue as an integral part of the
making of the scientist; but scientists
do not rule the world. It is the
statesmen and politicians who hold the
key to two doors; one leading to
peace, progress and prosperity and
the other to total destruction and anni-
hilation. Let us pray that sanity will
prevail and the key shall never be
turned to open the second door.

NUGLEAR
EXPLOSIVES?

by Carlo Schaerf

Ace a decade of costly
research on nuclear explosives for
military purposes, the countries most
involved in the production of atomic
weapons have begun to consider the
possibility of using nuclear explosives
for peaceful purposes in civil engineer-
ing and industry.

The reasons for this are chiefly
economic. Since 1940, astronomic
