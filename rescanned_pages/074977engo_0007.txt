GOODBYE TO ANOTHER ILLUSION

disappear quickly in the Sahara.
Indeed, the only “illusion” which is
real is the mirage.

S ‘disapoe illusions about the Sahara

The illusion which I resent most is the “till the sands of the desert grow cold”
idea. I have been colder in the Sahara than I was in Greenland.

I have been wearing a windproof coat, a camel-hair undercoat, a tweed suit, a
pullover and winter underwear, and at high-noon, as we drove in the command car, my

teeth have been chattering.

Believe me, it is winter in the Sahara, with a north-east wind which cuts like a

knife.

The French officer who is escorting us is wise: he wears an Arab burnous, that

all-service garment of the nomad, a heavy, hooded cloak of camel hair which is at
“once an overcoat, a blanket and a self-contained tent.

Frost on the Desert

he cold has made George, the geo-

physicist, “hopping mad”. He despe-

rately wants a photograph of “la
dune blanche” which means a sand dune
covered with hoar frost, He wants it as
visible proof of the dew in the Sahara, of
water in the “arid” sand.

It explains a great deal of the mystery
of the hydrological cycle—water-evapora-
tion-condensation-water-wells—in which
" the scientists here are convinced that they
have a practical answer to the desert
problem,

‘What annoys him is that Sergeant Wal-
ter, the keeper of the barrage at Igli, 70
miles north of Beni Abbes, has been seeing
“la dune blanche” for a week, for ten mi-
nutes at a time.

Sergeant Walter is a classic example of
“man against the desert”. He is a giant
German who at 65 has the poker-back of
the legionnaire. In 1913 he quarrelled
with his father, left Germany and joined
the Foreign Legion—in the violent, ruth-
less days of Beau Geste, and of men who
chose to be forgotten.

FOSSATUM AfRICAE. — Among the first men
to fight against the desert were the Romans. In
Southern Algeria, on the frontiers of their Afri
can possessions they erected fortifications, around
which colonies arew up. This aerial photograph
shows traces of irrigation works comprising low
stone walls which retained flood waters, thus
preventing it from being quickly lost and eroding
the soil. (Photo taken from « Vue Aérienne de
L'Organisation Romaine dans le Sud Algérien »).

All his life was spent in the desert and
. when he retired he could not leave it.

“Sand Rose In Crystal
ow he is a solitary white man, keeper
N of the waters where Oued Cuir joins
Oued Saoura. An “oued” is what

appears on maps farther east as a “wadhi”
_—a river which flows intermittently.

At the time of a “crue” or spate it races
from the Atlas, a wall of water which may
be ten feet high. For a few brief days it
courses as a river, spreads itself over the
valleys and disappears eventually into the
sand wastes to the south.

His job at the barrage is to see that the
flood-waters are directed into irrigation
canals and basins where it will linger a
little longer.

He produced for me a “sand rose” as big
as a flower-show cauliflower. George will
tell you that this “rose” is another proof
of the abundance of Sahara dew, for it is
an aggregation of sand-crystals, with
“petals” with fine veins, but as hard as
quartz. These crystals grow from a com-
bination of dew and sand and sun.

“Rain-Makers®> Visit

ur mission may become legendary in

the desert—as the visit of the “rain-

makers”. ‘We brought the first rains
to North Africa, the first snows to the
Atlas, hail and rain to the High Plateau,
and as we journeyed south places which
get less than two inches of rain in ten
years have had a millimetre or two as
cur “baksheesh”.

At one place, under a cloudless sky, an
Arab was frantically making irrigation
canals. To our surprised interpreter he.

said a “crue” was coming. He must have"

smelt it. Two hours later there piled up
the blackest, most sinister, thunderstorm
I have ever seen, turning daylight into
night.

‘We caught the flcunce of its rain, but it
broke over the mountains.

Lightning in the desert does extraor-
dinary things. As the fork strikes the
dunes it fuses the sand into glass. I have
a hollow glass tube as a souvenir of
“lightning-glass”. One of George’s jobs in
this remote outpost is to study electric
storms.

No Slaves To Sacrifice

0, on our transitory experience of this
part of the Sahara another illusion—
the “rainless desert”— has gone.

The sparse rain itself is no solution,
except accumulatively and in the mecha-
nism of desert dew. Rain on the rocky
desert evaporates and is gone, but in the
vast sand dunes it is not necessarily so.
The dunes are like a sponge, which
absorbs water two ways (probably), by
rain (recondensed- as dew and reabsorbed)
and by upward seepage from the water-
bearing strata.

This “sponge” explains the “foggara~,
the mine-shafts which one sees in the
cliffi-faces from which a steady flow or
water persists at all seasons. These tun-
nels go many miles into the earth, drain-
ing the water. They are age-old, tunnell-
ed by slaves into the collapsing earth.

Now they are choking up. There are no
slaves tc be sacrificed and no mechanised
equipment.

Money wages are unknown, but ex-
cept in mutual catastrophe, dependants
would never be allowed to starve, But
they cannot escape their servitude
except by trekking north to even
greater squalor in the ports, already
overcrowded with migrants from the
desert.

“Liberation can come only with the
provision of new water supplies and
the creation and settlement of new
lands”, said Col. Quenard, “then we
can give a freer and fuller life to the
peoples of the Sahara.”

On the wall was a great map of the
Sahara on which his predecessors pre-
viously disposed troops and on which
he now pointed out to me the develop-
ment areas already in progress. On
his suggestion, we came to Abadla and
visited Taghit en route.

Taghit is a picture-postcard version of
the desert. There is a red Legionary
fort guarding an oasis in a valley
between smoking sand dunes. These
mountains with their windswept plumes of
sand might pass for volcanoes. Looking
down from the fort battlements on the
palm-treed oasis, one would say “This is
a paradise”. And judging from the number
of “marabouts” or little temples conse-
crated to the memory of Moslem saints,
the Arabs must find it a particularly holy
place. -

NEVER

man beings who live in the five
villages “paradise” is dates and water.
They never see bread because they
have nothing to exchange for flour.
The soil is inhospitable. The river
bed is encrusted with salt as thick as

snow. They are to try a tobacco crop
there to barter for flour. .

Abadla, 60 miles to the west, is a very
different story. The approach to the valley
of the Guir is forbidding, through grim de-
files and over a wilderness of slatey grey-
ness, a Golgotha of desolation.

Then over a ridge, one is dazzled bv
glitter of surprising greenness. “Surpris-
ing” because in the Sahara. where the
famarisks, the jujubiers, the scrub and the
plants are a dusty lavender grey, one for-
gets what greenery looks like.

This, in the middle of the desert, was a
field of wheat and beside it the prosperous
market garden of the military post.

We drove for miles across the basin of

the Guir, over- a surface as hard as
concrete. But it was sand-baked silt,
inches thick, deposited by the spate of the
Guir, scouring the eroded soil of the
Moroccan Atlas and leaving it here.

The agricultural engineers of the
Society of Rural Amelioration showed
how, with tractors, soil-breakers and
disc-ploughs, they break up the sur-
face and find rich damp soil under-
neath. The scheme is to create units
of 1000 acres, with a heavy tractor, a
light tractor and implements for each
unit, on a collective farming basis.
The Arabs will have their farms and
will hand over a fifth of the produce
for supplying other parts of the
Sahara.

20.000 acres of this valley, which
30 1miles long and three miles

broad, are already scheduled as
valuable soil and the total may be as high
as 125.000 acres. The “crues” or spates of
the Guir will be controlled by a traditional
Arab system of successive weirs instead of
a great dam. .\ dam would choke with
silt. The shallow basins will collect the
silt and become rich acres themselves, with
the river being periodically diverted over
new wetrs,

Colonel Quenard reckons that the
grain from the Guir and from a
second desert valley can supply not
only the entire bread needs of the
Sahara, but provide a surplus for
export. Apart from grain and other
local crops, it is proposed to try cotton
growing for the fibre and for animal
feed. Flocks and .herds are to be
increased and improved. And this
valley of the nomads will become an
area of settled cultivation in the
desert.

VANISHED FOREST

Hu in this valley I may have found
the answer to the childish question I

~ have asked evervone in the desert :
“Where did Hasdrubal, the Carthaginian,
get his elephants?” Maybe from the Guir.
for Suetonius Polinius, in AD 47, reported
that there still existed here a great forest
abattnding with elephants and wild ani-
mals.
