cities, Florence, Italy, for the Fifth Session of the UNESCO General Conference. In terms

of the number of men and women present, and in terms of the number of countries
represented, the Florence Conference is expected to be the greatest in UNESCO's career.

In terms of the urgency of worldwide problems in the illimitable fields of education, science
and culture, the Florence Conference will be Bne of the most important international gatherings
in the still-young year of 1950. History books which are not yet written wiil gauge the courage,
brotherhood, wisdom and breadth of vision which the delegates will bring to Florence—measuring

them against the magnitude of the human needs they are called upon to answer.

In a sense, the work must be worthy of the city, as Florence takes its place, with London, Paris,

Mexico City and Beirut, on the list of UNESCO's conference cities.

Florence was a little town, when it was destroyed for the first time in the 6th century by barbarian
in later centuries, Florence was swept by plagues, fires and repeated invasions, climaxed

invaders.
by the cruel losses in World War Il, but it
recovered from every brutal blow to become a
great and ever greater city—a fit home for poets
painters and philosophers, who set new
standards for human achievement.

UNESCO is coming to the city of Dante,
Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Masaccio, Michel-
angelo, Boccaccio--who have given courage,
inspiration and beauty to generation after
generation, in every corner of the world.

The quality that lived in those great men,
and in the lesser ones who built, protected
and cherished the city of Florence, is still alive,
in the towns and cities of the world. Always,
that quality of aspiration shows itself best
under conditions of the greatest difficulty.
To-day, in Italy, after more than 20 years of
Fascism, five years of war and only a little more
than five years of peace, the determination of
the people to win a richer life, materially and
spiritually, is newly demonstrated every day.
On this page, in the story of the National Union
for the Fight Against llliteracy, there is one
such demonstration.

recognizes ignorance as his enemy.

for ignorance is the most loathe-
some tyranny of all. It stands for
filth, darkness, cold, hunger, sickness,
loneliness and fear. It means early
death after a miserable life, and the
helpless waiting at the bedside of a
stricken child. Ignorance is everything
that man hates — and its destruction
is not to be accomplished by a few
pen strokes in the cool twilight of li-
braries.

In the departments of Calabria and
Lucania, in Southern Italy, there has
been an uprising of the people against
ignorance, stimulated and aided by the
Naticnal Union for the Fight Against
Illiteracy, an organization founded in
Rome in December 1947, by a group of
seven young people who could afford to
give only their free time from regular
jobs. ,
‘Work began with statistical recogni-
tion of the affinity between ignorance
and fascism. In all of Italy “illiteracy
had been reduced steadily during the
50 years before Mussa'ini’s “ march on
Rome ” in 1922. Spot checks in Lau-

renzana and Picerno showed that fas-
cism had stopped and reversed this
trend. Ignorance, as expressed by
figures on illiteracy, regained all the
ground it had lest since 1910.

The Union’s first printed report, re-
ceived recently by UNESCO said :
“The major participation of the
people will have the result of a civic
conscience. The problem is not one
for the schools alone, but one invol-
ving the whole community. From the
community itself, in a demccratic
regime, must come that force and ini-
tiative to sustain the fight and raise
the standard of the people. ”

A BEAUTIFUL SCHOOL
BRINGS FELICITY

TILL, this was talk — and perhaps
there was a danger it might not
get beyond the stage of talk, but...

« It was felt the convention should
prcduce scmething permanent, and it
was decided to build a small rural
schcol at Scalo Nova Siri, near the
plains of Metaponto.

“ We had said that a beautiful
school brings felicity to the town —
because, little by litt'e, even the town
becomes beautiful — and we remem-
bered the school of Colle di Fuori,
built 20 years ago by Giovanni Cena.

« So it was decided to construct the
school at Sca'o Nova Siri — because
this town was very poor and was in real
need of a beautiful schcol. ”

Detailed and orderly plans were

" made — for surveys, teacher’s training

ccurses, publicity — but it has not
been easy to preserve details and order
during the ensuing hurricane of popu-
lar demand. Posters were put up In
the streets of towns in Basilicata
asking the people to sign up for liter-
acy courses.

“In the brief space of 15 days”, says
the report, “schools arose in
Basilicata. They were so popular
that the committees did not have
encugh time to cpen classes. They

all! of

would provide for three; to-morrow
they would need five; after two days

they would need ten. Soon there °

were no more teachers available,

“ There were tumults cutside the
schools, as at Muro Lucano, where,
the local brigade of the carabinieri
had to come running to make peace
among the people, or in Tricarico
where for several days the people sat
waiting outside the schools, quietly, so
that the more fortunate ones could
listen to the lesson. ”

Learning and light were found to be
identical, in the most immediate
sense : ,

“ The community of Bernalda dces
not have enough central electricity
and suffers from a continuous lack of
light. It was decided that the town
could very well remain dark, but the
schoel should always have light.
Accordingly, a special installation was
made for the school and the school
always has light.

«“ Now it is the light of the school,
high up there in the night, by which
the farmers coming in from the fields
at night, find their way into the
town, all of the rest of which is dark.”

TEACHERS LEARNED
FROM THE PUPILS

T is not certain whether it is the
students or the teachers who have
learned more from the courses :

,“ Many of the teachers were young
and inexperienced. Now they were to
teach adult men and women.

“ So we had to prepare the teachers
not only for the courses, but we had
to impart to them specific social ma-
terial about the customs and art and
culture of the locality; to arouse inte-
rest and admiration for the region in
which they would teach, so that they
would come to respect tne adu't stu-
dents who represented the region. ”’

but it is estimated that more than
10.000 adults in Basilicata learned to
read in the first year of work. At the
beginning of the year, there were 185
popular courses in Basilicata, and
there was pressure to reduce their
number for reasons of economy. After
a year’s work, there were 291 courses.

It was an afterthought to ask for in-
ternational assistance, but news of
the campaign reached other parts
of the world. A contribution of 260
books came from the Don Suisse orga-
nizaticn in Switzerland ; two crates of
miscellaneous school supplies were re-
ceived from the children of the Mas-
ters School of Dobbs Ferry, New York.

Much more is still needed. In the
words of the report :

_“ A pencil, a copy-book, ‘are pre-
cious treasures and we, who have gone
from town to town, know the requests
made by the towns are most modest.
Some of the requests are: a light by
which to ccnduct classes at night ; a
blackboard, glass for the windows, a
chair for the teacher. ”
